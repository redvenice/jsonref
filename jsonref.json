Oxfam claims no UK jobs have been lost, though some sources dispute this.Kenya is a controversial choice for a charity struggling to put its house in order. According to anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, out of 180 nations it is the 37th most corrupt Britain is the eighth least corrupt.There were protests in Kenya last year over the £50,000-a-year wages of the country\u0027s MPs compared to the average wage of £1,000 a year. Some were claiming £15,000 a month in mileage allowance.The UK Charity Commission is one of the world\u0027s strictest watchdogs. Oxfam says its new HQ answers to the Kenyan foreign ministry.One of the worst cases of sex abuse by Oxfam aid workers in Haiti involved Raphael Mutiku, a Kenyan from Nairobi, who has denied any wrongdoing. After failing to act over sexual harassment claims against him by female Oxfam staff in 2010, later, when he was accused of using prostitutes at his Oxfam villa, one of his bosses joked: \u0027Can he turn off his libido I wonder?\u0027The mystery over Oxfam\u0027s Kenya move has been fuelled by Ms Byanyima\u0027s secret Memorandum of Understanding and Host Country Agreement with Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta.Oxfam says it gives it \u0027tax relief\u0027 on its HQ and \u0027goods imported for official use\u0027 but no \u0027personal tax benefits\u0027 or \u0027immunity against law breaking\u0027. It refused to give further details.One aid expert said: \u0027By cutting their tax bill in Kenya, Oxfam is depriving Kenya of cash to build its own schools and hospitals itself. Charity leaders rage against private companies which avoid tax.\u0027In 2015, Ms Byanyima and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell accused \u0027corporate tax dodging\u0027 companies of robbing the poor of vital public services.At face value she and President Kenyatta are not natural allies.          Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, Ms Byanyima\u0027s former loverShe is a passionate human rights campaigner he was accused by the International Criminal Court of crimes against humanity for allegedly inciting election violence in 2007 in which 1,200 Kenyans died.She runs big aid projects he says Africa should \u0027give up aid\u0027 because it hinders progress.When Mrs May visited Kenya in August, Kenyatta complained she was the first British Prime Minister to visit for 30 years and appeared deliberately to forget Boris Johnson\u0027s name.Most intriguing of all is Ms Byanyima\u0027s complex, lifelong political and personal relationship with Uganda\u0027s president Yoweri Museveni who, at 74, is clinging to power even though he is hated by millions of Ugandans. In the 1980s she fought alongside him in guerrilla war that saw him seize power. She was also Museveni\u0027s lover, but later married his personal doctor Kizza Besigye – according to some reports, after Museveni refused to leave his wife for her.Museveni fell out with Besigye, who became Uganda\u0027s opposition leader and has fought and lost four elections to him – with wife Winnie at his side. She is a member of her husband\u0027s Forum for Democratic Change party.Besigye fled the country claiming his life was at risk. When he returned Museveni tried and failed to jail him on rape charges. But Ms Byanyima\u0027s political fortunes continued to thrive in Uganda and beyond, rising to become United Nations \u0027Gender Development\u0027 director in 2006.Cynics said that Museveni helped her, a claim she denied, while admitting she still met him in a political capacity.Now, in another twist, it is said she is plotting to succeed him as president of Uganda herself – with her new HQ in nearby Kenya a convenient launchpad. In a recent BBC interview she said she would be \u0027honoured\u0027 to lead her nation. Challenged about her \u0027long personal relationship\u0027 with Museveni and whether it was \u0027in conflict\u0027 with her Oxfam duties (it has big aid projects in Kenya and Uganda), she showed a rare flash of anger – apologising for doing so.But she could not control her ire. Museveni had no right to \u0027entrench himself in power\u0027 and it was Oxfam\u0027s – and her – job to \u0027energise citizens in defence of his assault on Uganda\u0027s constitution\u0027, she said.It was the call to arms of Winnie the African bush fighter – and worlds away from the UK Charity Commission\u0027s non-political rule.A former UK Cabinet minister with experience of overseas aid said: \u0027When British donors give to a British charity they do so with a sense of assurance it is regulated by the Charity Commission. It is hard to see how this can happen if Oxfam is run from Kenya.\u0027You could create a British \u0027badge\u0027 for a charity , then run it from abroad with little or no control. Oxfam has questions to answer.\u0027      It declined to give full details, saying the Kenyan government had not published the HCA.Oxfam said that aid programmes had traditionally been run by Oxfam GB and other \u0027affiliates\u0027, but since 2015 \u0027to be more efficient Oxfam began shifting them from affiliates to OI, and since 2017 all programmes have been run by OI\u0027.Oxfam later claimed OI had taken charge of \u0027staff management\u0027 of all aid projects, not the entire programmes.The switch of power from Oxfam GB to OI is part of the charity\u0027s \u0027One Global Oxfam\u0027 campaign. But the behind the scenes tensions it has caused at Oxfam GB can been seen in its annual report last year.Tellingly, it said: \u0027This process has been challenging as it involves Oxfam GB giving up power. In the past we managed, spent and accounted for the money we raised from the British public and institutions.\u0027Now we share this responsibility with others and act as a partner rather than a manager.\u0027The Charity Commission confirmed OI is not registered with it.A commission spokesman said that in a recent investigation shortly before the Haiti scandal into claims of sexual harassment by Oxfam staff, it asked Oxfam GB to safeguard staff where it had \u0027shared responsibilities, in particular with Oxfam International\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"British judges biggest pay rise nearly decade","story":"    Judges were handed their biggest pay rise for nearly a decade yesterday.

He had famously sold it for £1 to City investors the year before.Sometimes the texts would arrive before daybreak, sometimes late at night, as Green tried to bully me into meeting with him.I asked my office to tell him that I could not help him in any way, especially if he was concerned about The Pensions Regulator’s ongoing investigations into the BHS pension scheme. The company had a £571million pension deficit and the Regulator was examining calls for Green, who had run BHS for 15 years, to contribute to the scheme (which he eventually did, to the tune of £363million, in February 2017).But Green refused to accept the response from my office, and continued to bombard me with texts and phone messages.Part of one such text, sent late at night on February 1 2016, read: ‘...I am happy to wait till wed night after which I will go where I have to go. This is not a threat but I have to look after our business I trust you will understand. As I have said you dont even know what I want to talk to you about. Look forward to your reply thankyou.’I received another at 05:34 am on February 2 and several more that day, including the following at 20:34: ‘Am I to take it there is no chance of a meeting if no I will have to do or go wherever u feel. Not looking to cause you any problems but u can’t just do nothing.’He simply would not take no for an answer. I asked him to put in writing what it was he wished to discuss. I asked him to explain why he needed to see me. But he refused to say and just replied in riddles.If I had been a man, I believe he would have replied more courteously and at the very least told me what he wished to talk about. He was playing games with me. He seemed to feel entitled to behave like this – complaining that he was a big employer and hectoring me: ‘This is crazy we need a solution.’The pressure increased as he persuaded other people to call me to intervene on his behalf.I explained again that I would not break with protocol to meet him while he was under investigation. He then accused me of behaving ‘exactly like the Regulator’ – Lesley Titcomb – and levelling accusations of incompetence against us both.To be treated like this was frightening and frustrating. Men who insult and demean women in this way need to realise that such behaviour is simply unacceptable. I was hugely grateful to my loyal officials who tried to protect me against Green’s bullying tactics.When I left office in July 2016, the BHS saga was still rumbling on. It was after I gave evidence to the Parliamentary Committee investigation into the failure of the BHS pension scheme that the bullying began again.Green phoned me to warn me not to speak against him, that I should shut up and not talk about the situation. Again his threatening tone was deeply disturbing. Being subjected to such intimidating behaviour is a terrible strain on mental wellbeing.  Green was pictured on the phone while walking through the Sabino Canyon recreation area on FridayPerhaps he would argue that he treats both men and women in this manner, but I do not believe that is true – and even if it is, no woman should have to put up with this any more.Once, it was the norm for men to belittle women in the workplace. When I began my business career in the City of London in the early 1980s, it was a male-dominated bastion of testosterone-fuelled machismo.Lewd, crude comments, swearing and sexual innuendo were rife. Men would discuss their sexual exploits after business trips or weekends away. I felt uneasy much of the time.Nearly all female staff in those days were in secretarial or administrative roles and treated with disdain, regularly insulted and rudely criticised, both about their competence and their appearance.Professional women were few and far between, and I was often the only female in meetings, or in the Directors’ Dining Room, usually feeling uncomfortable at the conversation going on around me. I wish I’d spoken up against this sooner and I am ashamed I was too intimidated to do so.The sad fact is that it’s very probable that nothing I said would have done any good.In those days, if you wanted to make a success of your career, you just had to put up with it. But as I became more senior, it became easier to tell colleagues this behaviour was unacceptable. And over time, things have definitely changed.Having more women in Parliament, as well as the promotion of more women into senior roles in the workplace has helped, while stronger legislation helps to protect us against misogyny, bullying and intimidation.Most men have accepted the new realities. However, there are still some who seem not to have moved with the times.In particular, there has been a noticeable increase recently in attempts to cover up sexual harassment, such as the use of non-disclosure agreements for female staff working at the now notorious President’s Club men-only charity event in January this year, or financial payoffs by powerful men to silence women who say they experienced sexual or racist harassment.This would suggest there is a creeping danger of the bullying, macho, behaviour of yesteryear making a resurgence. These abuses must be rooted out and the perpetrators condemned.Women too often have been silenced and bullied into submission. I know what this feels like: it takes its toll on self-esteem and mental equilibrium. So I feel I must speak up for the sake of future generations of women.Let us be clear. It is not acceptable for powerful men to treat anyone rudely or with disdain. But it is certainly not acceptable for men to bully women and entirely wrong for men to try to buy women’s silence.Many of us have fought hard for women’s progress over the years. We know what it was like before and do not want to return to those times. If we do not call out the unacceptable behaviour now, there is a danger that it will become more widespread.We’ve made enormous strides in achieving recognition and respect, in moving towards equality, but we cannot rest easy.

He doesn\u0027t contact us. John was quite delicate all along.\u0027Indeed his lifestyle in South London is so reclusive and quiet — and his attitude to fame so hostile — that the band apparently don\u0027t expect him to respond when they contact him.His wife sometimes tells callers to their home that he \u0027doesn\u0027t live here\u0027, or that she \u0027doesn\u0027t know where he is\u0027.Neighbours say that they are aware that he lives next door, but they barely see him from one year to the next. The only exception was the local pub, where he used to call in three times a week for a glass of white wine with his wife — but it has now become a supermarket.So why is he so reclusive?          This week, just a few miles away, his former friends Brian May (left) and Roger Taylor (right) strolled up the purple carpet at the premiere of the film Bohemian Rhapsody (Rami Malek, centre, who plays the role of Freddie Mercury)Drummer Taylor describes him as a \u0027sociopath\u0027, while May suggests that Deacon has never recovered since a booze and drug-soaked period which he implies led to a breakdown more than 35 years ago.Extraordinarily, Taylor says they haven\u0027t spoken in more than a decade. \u0027I haven\u0027t heard a squeak from John, not a single guttural grunt,\u0027 he adds. \u0027We\u0027re not in touch but John\u0027s a sociopath, really, and he\u0027s given his blessing to whatever Brian and I might do with the brand — and we\u0027ve done rather a lot.\u0027May says he contacts Deacon often to ask permission for various commercial enterprises to do with Queen (Deacon remains a quarter shareholder in Queen Productions Limited) but it\u0027s not clear how much of a response he gets.The company is blue-chip to say the least — turnover was recorded at £18.5 million in 2017, with that figure set to swell thanks to the new film.Not that you would suspect such riches from his unassuming home in Putney, which he bought with his first royalty cheque.He\u0027s never moved, because he didn\u0027t want to disrupt the schooling of his six children. This quiet living is the exact opposite of the showy excesses of Queen.          John Deacon, left, Freddie Mercury, centre, and Brian May, right, pictured in 1979The band were famous for always demanding the best, for spending more than anyone else on private jets, stretch limos, fleets of assistants, hairdressers, designer stage costumes and the rest.There were four-course backstage feasts with candelabras, orgiastic parties involving dwarves and bowls of cocaine and appearances by performance artists, like the man who lay naked under a pile of chopped liver and was ordered to make the meat twitch when people walked past.The band was formed in 1970, originating from a band called Smile which included May, then a student at Imperial College.A fan of the band was Farrokh Bulsara, a student at Ealing College, who joined as the vocalist and changed his name to Freddie Mercury.They had a number of bass players before settling on Deacon. Legend has it that he was the seventh one they auditioned.          Queen were, of course, shattered by Freddie Mercury\u0027s death in 1991, but since then, May (right) and Roger Taylor (centre left) have continued to record, tour and perform, both as solo artists and as Queen\u0027We were so over-the-top, we thought that because he was quiet, he would fit in with us without too much upheaval,\u0027 recalled Taylor. May agreed: \u0027He\u0027s very solid and no-nonsense. He\u0027s always got his feet firmly on the ground.\u0027Deacon grew up in Leicestershire, the eldest child of an insurance broker, Arthur, who died when John was 11.He had been encouraged by his father to take up music, and formed his own band at 14. Deacon was, like May, a technological pioneer.He has a first-class degree in electronics from Chelsea College, and used to build equipment for the band, his most famous creation being the \u0027Deacy Amp\u0027 amplifier.Worldwide fame came in the mid 70s, with Bohemian Rhapsody. Their touring was legendary and their studio albums were complex and expensive to make.Deacon was known to hang back on stage, and those who remember him from this time say he seemed cripplingly shy — although with a dry sense of humour.\u0027John is one of those guys who will say nothing and then he will crack a joke, something really near the knuckle, and you will think: \u0027Did I really hear that right?\u0027 says Jacky Smith, who runs the Queen International fan club. He and Freddie were particularly friendly and would hang out together between gigs.Manager Chris O\u0027Donnell says: \u0027Brian May and Roger Taylor, who were the real rockers in the band, would slip away to hang out at some club in town leaving Freddie and John behind. John gradually started leaving too, and Freddie would go off to prowl the gay clubs.\u0027           Deacon was known to hang back on stage, and those who remember him from this time say he seemed cripplingly shy — although with a dry sense of humour. Left to right: John Deacon, Freddie Mercury, Roger Taylor and Brian MayPhil Sutcliffe, author of Queen: The Ultimate Illustrated History of the Crown Kings of Rock, said: \u0027John Deacon was very much the silent bass player which is why these days he can go around practically incognito, which is just the way he likes it.\u0027He was always ambivalent about the attention.\u0027Queen was a very volatile partnership between three explosive personalities, and then you had John, who was the still point. He had his family early on, from 1975, and was very much a family man.\u0027Deacon married Veronica Tetzlaff, a pretty blonde Polish Catholic trainee teacher, in January 1975 when she was pregnant with their first son, Robert, and Queen were just tasting global fame. They went on to have four more sons and a daughter. May said in an interview last year that the band  out of control while recording in Munich in the early 1980s. In a book he said that the band were: \u0027Living in a fantasy world of vodka and barmaids.\u0027He added: \u0027We all lost our minds . . . we were all in a perilous place where our emotions were out of control.\u0027It manifested itself in way too much drinking, a certain amount of drugs, which I didn\u0027t share — but certainly an awful lot of vodka went through my body. We all fell to bits.          Their touring was legendary and their studio albums were complex and expensive to make\u0027We overreacted with each other at times. We all left the band at some point. The studio\u0027s a hard place for a band anyway, but in our case all four of us as writers had had worldwide hits. The lifestyle we led magnified that conflict.\u0027May said it ended with \u0027John disappearing to Bali and seeing God or whatever\u0027. He added: \u0027He could be very outgoing and very funny, but I think some of the stuff that happened in Munich gave him a lot of damage, and I think losing Freddie was very hard for him as well. He found that incredibly hard to process, to the point where actually playing with us made it more difficult.\u0027In a rare interview, Deacon said he found the band\u0027s hiatus in 1985 hard to cope with. \u0027I went spare, really, because we were doing so little. I got really bored and quite depressed.\u0027Queen reformed the following year and continued to dominate the charts, playing sell-out stadium tours for the next two years.In July 1986 they threw a famous party at the Roof Gardens in Kensington to celebrate a gig at Wembley. The serving staff were entirely naked apart from body paint.Mercury, tortured by his promiscuous homosexuality, arrived with former girlfriend Mary Austin — his lover Jim Hutton nowhere to be seen. Deacon was overcome by booze. Fan club boss Jacky, who was on the same table, says: \u0027At one point late into the night John just slipped quietly off his chair, and ended up underneath the table. After a while he came back again. That was very John, he liked a drink.\u0027But Mercury\u0027s failing health began to cast a shadow. In 1987, not long after that party, Mercury was diagnosed HIV positive. As his health failed, the band made one final album. Mercury died in November 1991, and the band members were devastated — none more so than Deacon.Robert Ahwai, a friend of Deacon\u0027s from college, recalls: \u0027Maybe he thought, \u0027Freddie was the band, so what\u0027s the point?\u0027          Mercury died in November 1991, and the band members were devastated — none more so than Deacon\u0027He suffered from depression after Freddie died and I am not sure he has ever come out of it.\u0027Deacon played with May and Taylor at the Freddie Mercury Tribute concert in April 1992 and again, in January 1997, to showcase the final Queen song No-one But You (Only The Good Die Young) — a tribute to Mercury. Since then, he\u0027s barely been seen in public.When the musical We Will Rock You opened, May admitted that Deacon had not been to see it — although I\u0027m told he has been spotted in the audience.Queen author Sutcliffe says: \u0027After Freddie died, John withdrew more and more. I think Brian May once said that they tell John everything they are doing, and take his silence as acquiescence. He is an enigma.\u0027Jacky Smith agrees. \u0027John just gave up after Freddie died. He and Freddie were opposites really, because John is so shy and he was the youngest in the band. Freddie took him under his wing and they were very close for all those years.\u0027Freddie drew the attention away, and without Freddie there, I don\u0027t think John could face any of it.\u0027There was a short-lived scandal when it emerged in 2002 that Deacon had been visiting a strip bar and formed a friendship with lap dancer Emma Shelley, with whom he was photographed in central London.Those who know John say the episode seems out of character, and are dubious about how far these proclivities went.One neighbour said this week: \u0027You are wasting your time if you are trying to find John. He does live there, but he doesn\u0027t talk, not to anyone.\u0027I haven\u0027t seen him in a long time, he is fine, just private. The last time I saw him was a few months ago, in the summer.\u0027In an interview with a fansite some years ago, Deacon said his hobbies were drinking tea and having children.These days John Deacon\u0027s great passion is said to be golf — hardly the soul of rock \u0027n\u0027 roll. A desire for anonymity seems to be a recurring theme.The barman who used to serve him at his local pub revealed that he\u0027d been warned by Deacon\u0027s wife Veronica who the musician was — and was told not to mention Queen.So what next? Maybe John Deacon will go to see the new film, in which he is played by American actor Joseph Mazzello.But if he does, you can bet he will do his best to slip into the local cinema as just another anonymous face in the crowd."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/26/23/061B3CEA000007D0-6322479-Chancellor_Philip_Hammond_is_expected_to_say_he_wants_to_make_ou-m-7_1540594775242.jpg","title":"British couples able married pubs new marriage law changes","story":"    Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to say he wants to make \u0027outdated\u0027 rules around wedding venues simpler by reducing red tape and will announce a review of marriage lawHalloween-mad grandmother, 51, who is dubbed \u0027Scary Mary\u0027...\u0027Have fun at the ball\u0027: Autistic 5-year-old mistakes bride...Share this articleMr Hammond is expected to say he wants to make \u0027outdated\u0027 rules around wedding venues simpler by reducing red tape.The review of the laws on civil ceremonies in England and Wales would be conducted by the Law Commission. It will also consider how to accommodate increasing demand from couples to have a legally binding ceremony outdoors, which is currently permitted only in Scotland.To get a licence to hold weddings a venue must currently identify a specific area where the ceremony will take place.     The review of the laws on civil ceremonies in England and Wales would be conducted by the Law Commission and will also consider how to accommodate increasing demand from couples to have a legally binding ceremony outdoorsIt must be part of a building rather than in the open air or a marquee.The licence holder must also undertake that no food or alcoholic drinks are sold or consumed in the area one hour before and during the proceedings. Ministers believe this means many small business owners are put off trying to get a licence, restricting choice and driving up the cost for couples.Relaxing the rules could make it cheaper and simpler for couples to get married but there will be concerns about how the dignity of ceremonies will be preserved.The Church of England last night responded to the announcement with caution.

McDonald\u0027s fast food restaurant in Rotherham.  Within an easily-walkable radius, I counted no fewer than 21 fast-food premises — Kebabish, Pronto, Mama\u0027s Kitchen, Raja\u0027s, Pak Hoo House, New York Diner and Take Away, Flavours, Jazzi\u0027s. The list went on — and onAmid depressing scenes of urban decay, the building in All Saints Square, where he set up a kitchen to educate people in the art of wholesome cooking, now stands boarded up, a fate that has befallen a quarter of the town centre\u0027s shops and offices.Having passed into the hands of a charity after the TV series was screened, prompting accusations that its famous founder had lost interest as soon as the cameras stopped rolling, it was forced to close last year when, faced with a £42million budget shortfall, Rotherham council cut £72,500 from its funding.Just up the hill, the Rotherham Institute of Obesity, a pioneering weight-loss centre set up in 2009, when the town was still riding the wave of a health-kick, also shut down a year ago, despite helping its 7,000 patients to lose a total of 33.7 tonnes — again because the cash-strapped council withdrew its £300,000 grant.A nearby gym recently closed for lack of custom, too, though the JD Wetherspoon pub beneath it was doing a brisk trade this week.Ironically, given Oliver\u0027s mission, the only businesses that appeared to be truly thriving were the plethora of takeaways that have colonised the inner reaches of the town.Within an easily-walkable radius, I counted no fewer than 21 fast-food premises — Kebabish, Pronto, Mama\u0027s Kitchen, Raja\u0027s, Pak Hoo House, New York Diner and Take Away, Flavours, Jazzi\u0027s. The list went on — and on.

Oxfam claims no UK jobs have been lost, though some sources dispute this.Kenya is a controversial choice for a charity struggling to put its house in order. According to anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, out of 180 nations it is the 37th most corrupt Britain is the eighth least corrupt.There were protests in Kenya last year over the £50,000-a-year wages of the country\u0027s MPs compared to the average wage of £1,000 a year. Some were claiming £15,000 a month in mileage allowance.The UK Charity Commission is one of the world\u0027s strictest watchdogs. Oxfam says its new HQ answers to the Kenyan foreign ministry.One of the worst cases of sex abuse by Oxfam aid workers in Haiti involved Raphael Mutiku, a Kenyan from Nairobi, who has denied any wrongdoing. After failing to act over sexual harassment claims against him by female Oxfam staff in 2010, later, when he was accused of using prostitutes at his Oxfam villa, one of his bosses joked: \u0027Can he turn off his libido I wonder?\u0027The mystery over Oxfam\u0027s Kenya move has been fuelled by Ms Byanyima\u0027s secret Memorandum of Understanding and Host Country Agreement with Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta.Oxfam says it gives it \u0027tax relief\u0027 on its HQ and \u0027goods imported for official use\u0027 but no \u0027personal tax benefits\u0027 or \u0027immunity against law breaking\u0027. It refused to give further details.One aid expert said: \u0027By cutting their tax bill in Kenya, Oxfam is depriving Kenya of cash to build its own schools and hospitals itself. Charity leaders rage against private companies which avoid tax.\u0027In 2015, Ms Byanyima and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell accused \u0027corporate tax dodging\u0027 companies of robbing the poor of vital public services.At face value she and President Kenyatta are not natural allies.          Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, Ms Byanyima\u0027s former loverShe is a passionate human rights campaigner he was accused by the International Criminal Court of crimes against humanity for allegedly inciting election violence in 2007 in which 1,200 Kenyans died.She runs big aid projects he says Africa should \u0027give up aid\u0027 because it hinders progress.When Mrs May visited Kenya in August, Kenyatta complained she was the first British Prime Minister to visit for 30 years and appeared deliberately to forget Boris Johnson\u0027s name.Most intriguing of all is Ms Byanyima\u0027s complex, lifelong political and personal relationship with Uganda\u0027s president Yoweri Museveni who, at 74, is clinging to power even though he is hated by millions of Ugandans. In the 1980s she fought alongside him in guerrilla war that saw him seize power. She was also Museveni\u0027s lover, but later married his personal doctor Kizza Besigye – according to some reports, after Museveni refused to leave his wife for her.Museveni fell out with Besigye, who became Uganda\u0027s opposition leader and has fought and lost four elections to him – with wife Winnie at his side. She is a member of her husband\u0027s Forum for Democratic Change party.Besigye fled the country claiming his life was at risk. When he returned Museveni tried and failed to jail him on rape charges. But Ms Byanyima\u0027s political fortunes continued to thrive in Uganda and beyond, rising to become United Nations \u0027Gender Development\u0027 director in 2006.Cynics said that Museveni helped her, a claim she denied, while admitting she still met him in a political capacity.Now, in another twist, it is said she is plotting to succeed him as president of Uganda herself – with her new HQ in nearby Kenya a convenient launchpad. In a recent BBC interview she said she would be \u0027honoured\u0027 to lead her nation. Challenged about her \u0027long personal relationship\u0027 with Museveni and whether it was \u0027in conflict\u0027 with her Oxfam duties (it has big aid projects in Kenya and Uganda), she showed a rare flash of anger – apologising for doing so.But she could not control her ire. Museveni had no right to \u0027entrench himself in power\u0027 and it was Oxfam\u0027s – and her – job to \u0027energise citizens in defence of his assault on Uganda\u0027s constitution\u0027, she said.It was the call to arms of Winnie the African bush fighter – and worlds away from the UK Charity Commission\u0027s non-political rule.A former UK Cabinet minister with experience of overseas aid said: \u0027When British donors give to a British charity they do so with a sense of assurance it is regulated by the Charity Commission. It is hard to see how this can happen if Oxfam is run from Kenya.\u0027You could create a British \u0027badge\u0027 for a charity , then run it from abroad with little or no control. Oxfam has questions to answer.\u0027      It declined to give full details, saying the Kenyan government had not published the HCA.Oxfam said that aid programmes had traditionally been run by Oxfam GB and other \u0027affiliates\u0027, but since 2015 \u0027to be more efficient Oxfam began shifting them from affiliates to OI, and since 2017 all programmes have been run by OI\u0027.Oxfam later claimed OI had taken charge of \u0027staff management\u0027 of all aid projects, not the entire programmes.The switch of power from Oxfam GB to OI is part of the charity\u0027s \u0027One Global Oxfam\u0027 campaign. But the behind the scenes tensions it has caused at Oxfam GB can been seen in its annual report last year.Tellingly, it said: \u0027This process has been challenging as it involves Oxfam GB giving up power. In the past we managed, spent and accounted for the money we raised from the British public and institutions.\u0027Now we share this responsibility with others and act as a partner rather than a manager.\u0027The Charity Commission confirmed OI is not registered with it.A commission spokesman said that in a recent investigation shortly before the Haiti scandal into claims of sexual harassment by Oxfam staff, it asked Oxfam GB to safeguard staff where it had \u0027shared responsibilities, in particular with Oxfam International\u0027. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/25/22/51A38BC400000578-0-image-a-6_1540503508065.jpg","title":"GYLES BRANDRETH reveals people think forget simple comma","story":"    Language is also power, and how we use it defines us.

Since the coming of Star Trek in 1966, promising \u0027to boldly go where no man has gone before\u0027, we\u0027ve all been at it.The rules may change, but it is important to know them, nonetheless. Here is the Brandreth guide to grammatical howlers and how to avoid them.          The main clause tells you the main thing: \u0027Travellers worry about their luggage.\u0027 The subordinate clause is exactly that — subordinate, giving you that little bit of extra information that\u0027s not quite so important: \u0027Most of the time.\u0027It\u0027s clear what this means: He liked Nigella, who cooked pasta better than Delia.Equally, it is clear this next sentence means something else: He liked Nigella, who cooked pasta, better than Delia.Don\u0027t use commas too frequently, but do use them:1) When you want your reader to pause: \u0027Do concentrate on this, please.\u00272) When you want to give emphasis to an adverb: \u0027I am saying this, loudly, so that you take it on board.\u00273) When you decide to omit a word to add drama to what you are saying: \u0027The night was young, his hopes were high. The dawn had arrived, his hopes were dashed.\u00274) If you are addressing someone by name, put a comma before the name to avoid confusion — such as, \u0027I fancy your sister, Basil.\u0027Lose the comma and apparently you have the hots for an Italian nun: \u0027I fancy your Sister Basil.SEMI-COLONSThis won\u0027t take long it\u0027s important, believe me.Read that last sentence out loud and you should see exactly what the semi-colon is doing. It\u0027s providing a pause that is longer and more significant than a comma, and less abrupt and intrusive than a full stop.For those who relish nuance in their punctuation it\u0027s the go-to punctuation mark. I love the semi-colon for my money, it\u0027s undervalued and underused.It should be used between two main clauses that balance each other — or contradict each other — but are too closely linked to be written as separate sentences: I love my wife she loves me. I love my cat my dog doesn\u0027t give a damn.You must use a semi-colon when a comma is replacing a full stop in a quotation, or a quotation is linking two separate sentences: \u0027I\u0027m so sorry to have to tell you this,\u0027 he said \u0027your cat has croaked.\u0027      "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/27/00/04BF2385000007D0-0-image-m-30_1540597506589.jpg","title":"Newcastle Council considering telling people recycle LESS","story":"    In Newcastle, yoghurt pots and margarine tubs cannot be recycled whereas Reading will accept these itemsIt would mark a huge turnaround after years of residents around the country having to separate rubbish into more and more bins to help hit recycling targets. Plastic is often too contaminated with food waste to be recycled meaning local authorities have to pay to send it to landfill or an incinerator.Currently UK households face 39 sets of rules over what plastics they can recycle.

The right soundtrack has the power to transform even a burger and chips into a fine-dining experience, at least according to research by Cornell University. Why? Because the music makes us eat more mindfully and even perceive our food more favourably.“Dinner parties are essentially about communication and the mingling of several different conversations, so you want background music that’s sophisticated enough to spark conversation, then melt away rather than competing with your chat,” says composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty recently topped the iTunes classical charts. So what music works best with different dishes? We spoke to a range of experts – from restaurateurs to party planners and composers to find out.Soundtrack for starters“I put as much thought and care into the music I play at a dinner party as I do into my cooking,” says restaurateur Asma Khan of the Darjeeling Express in Soho, London.Her favourite starter is a mutton shikampuri kebab, a recipe from the Royal Kitchens of Hyderabad. “It has a uniquely layered shah-jeera flavour,” she says. “You think it’s mild at first, then the cardamom and cumin spice blend hits you. Most people don’t recognise all the flavours, but this starter never fails to impress.”While guests dig in, Khan plays the classical Indian Sufi song Maula-e-Kull, sung by Abdida Parveen. “It has a very deep rhythm,” she says. “You don’t need to understand the words to feel the emotion in the voice of the singer: it starts off with the love between two people, then becomes deeply complex. Both the song and the starter have this incredible hidden layering, and together they set a rich, serene tone for your evening.”Your musical main“The right music helps the conversation flow, which is particularly important when your guests are meeting for the first time,” says Alice Matthews, founder of MotherHustler supper clubs.“I love the classical guitar interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Air on a G String, by Richard Mollenbeck,” she says. Like the vegetarian tagine she serves her guests, the music is about different interpretations of a classic, melodiously coming together to create something new. “I’ve discovered guests relax and enjoy themselves more when eating familiar food and listening to familiar music, but in a heightened, luxurious atmosphere,” she says.Sweet symphony“I love to cook with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, and my taste in music reflects that too,” says Henrietta Inman, author of The Natural Baker: A new way to bake using the best natural ingredients.“For a dinner party I’ll make my plum, blackberry and blueberry crumble, served with a rosemary and lemon syrup. The topping is crunchy and decadent, made with wholegrain spelt, oats and almonds.” And the perfect accompaniment? The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, says Inman.“It’s a beautifully tranquil piece by an English composer and it brings to mind a dusky evening eating outdoors, with birds singing in the hedgerows and trees hanging heavy with ripe fruit,” she says.The tune for cheese“The cheese course comes at a perfect moment to steer conversation into another direction,” says La Fromagerie’s Patricia Michelson, author of Cheese.She recommends presenting a five-strong board with Sinodun Hill, a nutty goat’s cheese the creamy, sweet and aromatic Beaufort Chalet D’Alpage Lincolnshire Poacher Double Barrel, a hard cheese with a distinctive savoury acidity from the chalky soil where the cattle graze a decadent Brie aux Truffes and Regalis, a ewe’s milk blue that combines sharp mineral qualities with a rich, floral taste.On the playlist is a classical composition with a jazz vibe, such as the Jacques Loussier Trio playing Bach. “It’s reflective and stimulating but soft and flowing, and these are words I often use when describing cheese too,” says Michelson.The finale Just as a digestif serves to calm the mood at the end of the meal, music plays a similar role. “One of the wonderful things about music is it fills in any awkward silence at the end of your dinner party, when everyone’s said an awful lot,” says Davis.“I love an Amaretto, but I wouldn’t be as didactic as to suggest that a sweet liqueur goes with sweet music,” he says. “Go for something cosy that welcomes guests into your own personal comfort zone.”For that, try downloading Rêverie Nocturne by Giulio Regondi or Liberty by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

His consort song for five voices and five viols is effectively an early 17th-century rendering of the sounds of Cockney stallholders advertising everything from “lilywhite mussels and new fresh herrings” to “roasted sausage, hot puddings, fresh cheese and cream, and ripe strawberries”. It may well have been inspired by Clément Jannequin’s Voulez ouyr les cris de Paris – similarly including the everyday sounds of a Renaissance French street market.While today there are a few restaurants in which music students will entertain you with arias between courses, in centuries past musical accompaniment to dining was a common phenomenon. The concept only became formalised in the 18th century and the best-known collection of such work is Telemann’s Tafelmusik, (Table Music). Published in 1733, it is a traditional set of suites to be played by a small group of string players at banquets.A musical work inspired by food, which became a popular sensation following its 1898 London premiere, is Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The cantata for tenor, mixed chorus and orchestra sets part of Longfellow’s epic poem, delighting in the lush and sensual choral description of the sumptuous menu: “First they ate the sturgeon … and the pike … then on pemmican they feasted … and buffalo marrow, haunch of deer and hump of bison, yellow cakes of the Mondamin, and the wild rice of the river.”Belshazzar’s Feast (1931) depicts another impressive meal, this time a lavish banquet thrown by the hedonistic and hubristic Babylonian king. In the biblical cantata by William Walton, apart from generous libations of wine drunk from sacred goblets looted from the Temple of Jerusalem, Osbert Sitwell’s libretto does not tell us what was on the menu. However, a clue is given in a description of the city’s resources for such a meal: “fine flour, wheat, beasts and sheep”, which we might conclude, like the score, was lavish.On a smaller scale, Erich Korngold’s Die Gansleber im Hause Duschnitz, (The Goose-liver in the Duschnitz House) is a song written spontaneously by the Austrian composer following a meal in 1919, thanking his Viennese hosts by honouring their delicious main course, with his lyrics declaring: “Because a goose liver like this is a wondrous thing … when it’s browned, when it’s crisp and crackly …”In a rare instance of music from the perspective of the food itself, there is Olim lacus Colueram. Known as the Song of the Roasting Swan, the exquisite aria for tenor and chorus comes from the pseudo-medieval secular cantata Carmina Burana (1936) in which composer Carl Orff manages to create a sense of dizzying musical rotation as the roasting bird delivers its, er, swansong, with the tenor singing at the top of his range in sympathetic anguish.Turning to something more sugary, Hansel and Gretel, Engelbert Humperdinck’s 1893 operatic retelling of the Grimm fairy tale, features a gingerbread house covered in sweets. Tchaikovsky’s festive ballet The Nutcracker (1892) is also filled with confectionary, in which, following mice eating gingerbread soldiers, young Clara and her prince are whisked off to the Land of Sweets, which is ruled by the Sugar Plum Fairy, an otherworldly character represented by a brand-new twinkling keyboard instrument, the celesta.Then there are cookbooks set to music. La Bonne Cuisine (1947) was inspired by Emile Dumont’s culinary guide. From it the American composer Leonard Bernstein arranged four recipes for mezzo-soprano and piano. The gastronomic delicacies are Plum Pudding, Ox-Tails, Turkish Delight and Rabbit at Top Speed – the last well-named, as the entire song-cycle is under five minutes. Three years later with Ode à la Gastronomie (1950), composer Jean Françaix showed that the French can also have a sense of humour when it comes to food. His lighthearted satire punctures the pretentious solemnity of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin’s 1825 tome La Physiologie du gout, offering a both comic and exquisite paean to the sensual pleasures of eating, setting the gastronomic ruminations as a choral work for 13 a capella singers.Eating, of course, provides a backdrop for dramatic action and consequently it often crops up in opera. A great example is Giacomo Puccini’s La Bohème, which migrates from a cold and empty flat in Montmartre to the local Cafe Momus. There, among the riot of life, street vendors shout their wares: “Oranges, dates, hot chestnuts, trinkets, crosses, nougat, whipped cream, fruit pies, toffees, finches, sparrows, dates, coconut milk, carrots, trout and plums.” The friends enter the bistro and order sausage, roast venison, table wine, dressed lobster, creme caramel and chicken, before leaving the bill for hapless sugar daddy Alcindoro.Finally, there is food inspired by classical musicians. French modernist Erik Satie ate only white foods, so for more mouthwatering invocations one must look to the Italians and dishes created in their honour. Neapolitan tenor Enrico Caruso had a sauce named after him by Uruguayan chef Raymundo Monti. Salsa Caruso is a warm sauce for pasta consisting of cream, onions, ham, cheese, nuts and mushrooms. Meanwhile, Tournedos Rossini is a steak dish created by French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in collaboration with the famously food-loving composer. It consists of beef tournedos pan-fried in butter, served on a crouton, topped with hot slice of foie gras, garnished with black truffle and Madeira demi-glace sauce.And for afters? How about peach melba, the famous dessert of peaches and raspberry sauce with vanilla ice-cream, created in 1892 by French chef Auguste Escoffier at London’s Savoy Hotel for the Australian soprano Dame Nellie. Quite a final movement, that is.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing. Feeling inspired to cook your own masterpiece tonight?

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing. He pleads for another chapter each time we finish one. ‘You can read this yourself,’ I said. ‘Yes, but it’s funner having you read it so I can imagine it in my head’ he said.

And Euro MPs (never to be outdone by the commission) passed a resolution saying it is “crucial to maintain a unified EU time regime”. While we know from our daily diet of Brexit debates that the EU has standardised a lot in Europe, it has so far not managed to harmonise time. But the Juncker legislation now working its way through Brussels would put an end the biannual ritual of moving the clocks forward or back.In an added twist, the proposal leaves inidual EU nations to decide whether to live on summer or winter time, so potentially this law, if agreed by EU governments, is a first step to a single European time.Britain’s one-hour time difference with most of the EU, two hours with Greece and Finland, is a real – if little mentioned – barrier to frictionless trade. Phone calls go unanswered, deadlines get missed. It may be only 4pm in London, but in Athens it’s 6pm – so there’s no point trying to trace that missing feta delivery.The real costs to British business run into many millions. Time has always been a variable concept in the corridors of Brussels power. The old EU practice of “stopping the clock” in negotiations is legendary. If a midnight negotiation deadline approached, and it got to quarter to twelve with no deal in sight, the two sides could simply agree to stop the clock. I remember stories of negotiations when the clock didn’t move for days. Although, if at 11.45pm on 29 March next year, British and EU negotiators find themselves deal-less in the Brexit talks, stopping the clock won’t be an option, since the UK’s EU Withdrawal Act enshrines that Britain leave the EU at midnight Central European time (so Brexit will actually have happened an hour earlier in the UK).With all this temporal confusion, is there not the opportunity for a great British gesture? A chance to show that post-Brexit the British not only want to stay close friends with our European neighbours, but that we would like to make their and our lives easier. Theresa May could announce that next March, when the clocks go forward – just two days after Brexit – we will at least in one respect become more European, by shifting to Central European time.This could even be one of the few things that the country could rally around in our national Brexit row. And we might find that one element of our lives with Europe involves actually less friction rather than more. Time could become – if not the great healer – at least a balm on our Brexit sore.But as with so much to do with solving our European dilemmas, obstacles could come from two directions. First, the French. If Britain moved to Central European Time, there is nothing to stop French leader Emmanuel Macron using Juncker’s new law to fix France permanently on its summer time – keeping the French with their one-hour lead, and once again thwarting the British.And then there are the ultra Brexiteers. Jacob Rees-Mogg once tabled an amendment in the House of Commons calling for Somerset to have its own time zone. The ultra Brexiteers may yet hold May to ransom, and insist that Europe move to British time – rather than the other way around.• Nigel Gardner is a former European commission spokesman, and last year produced BBC2’s documentary series on Britain’s troubled history with the EU"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b4199fd899dc4911dc48b31d759daf1f90fb6b0/226_387_4908_2945/master/4908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e85ef5eda52a572420c595359ce4daaa","title":"dont normalise far right sometimes we must take it on","story":"Shunning people like Steve Bannon risks playing into their hands by allowing them to pose as victimsA word of our time is “normalisation”. It warns of the error of treating as normal that which should instead be shunned. It has in its sights the xenophobic, populist and racist right embodied by Donald Trump and his henchmen, as well as their European and British allies. It says that these people should not be afforded the usual courtesies of civilised, democratic life but should instead be left out in the cold.All my instincts are with the anti-normalisers. Indeed, when it comes to Trump, I got there early, writing in this slot even before he’d sworn the oath of office: “Don’t treat Donald Trump as if he’s a normal president. He’s not.” I’d happily extend that rule to the likes of Steve Bannon, briefly Trump’s chief strategist, now keen to pose as an impresario of the populist international, lending his semi-celebrity to far rightists from Italy’s Matteo Salvini to Britain’s own Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who styles himself “Tommy Robinson”.So my first impulse is to side with those outraged by the invitations recently extended to Bannon by the New Yorker or the Economist (the former cancelled under pressure, the latter went ahead). Similarly, I was as shocked as anyone else to see the original title – now changed – for an upcoming debate at London’s Conway Hall, featuring Trevor Phillips, Claire Fox, David Aaronovitch and the academic Matthew Goodwin: “Is rising ethnic ersity a threat to the west?”.The objections are familiar. In the Bannon case, those two great magazines were not only granting a platform to a white nationalist whose Breitbart site has long peddled multiple shades of bigotry and misogyny. They were lending him the prestige of their platform, dignifying his ideas with their own good name, thereby granting those ideas a mainstream legitimacy they should be denied.It’s no good simply crying free speech or denouncing censorship. Neither the Economist nor the New Yorker would open its doors to the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan or the Holocaust-denying David Irving, so we know they draw the line somewhere. The only question is where.The reason they would keep out the Klan or Irving is clear if apparently paradoxical. Tolerant societies can tolerate everything except extreme intolerance. Liberal democracy is allowed, or even obliged, to repel those who would, given half a chance, use the norms of liberal democracy to destroy it.To quote Andrew McLaughlin, a technologist who was invited to that same Economist festival and who protested against Bannon’s inclusion: “Treating racist extremists as pariahs is not just an expression of our revulsion at their views it is a necessary tactic in defending our liberal democratic order against those who aim to gain power within our systems only to replace them with something horrific.”That is the case against normalisation. Don’t normalise people like Bannon, don’t normalise the idea – long a staple of white supremacist talk – that ethnic ersity is a threat to western civilisation. All very simple, right?It should be, and yet two aspects of the current landscape have forced me to see that these questions are knottier than we might like. The first relates to technology and involves a pragmatic recognition of reality. In the good old days of “no platform” in the 1970s and 1980s, the practical goal of denying a racist a platform was plausible. If universities, publishers and the media agreed to shun, say, Irving, then Irving’s message would be all but unheard, confined to a few poorly produced magazines and hand-stencilled newsletters exchanged in dodgy pubs. Today, you might try to keep Yaxley-Lennon off the airwaves or a debate stage, but you could not deny him a platform: the Tommy Robinson Facebook page has more than 950,000 followers.“The internet has fundamentally undermined ‘no platform’ as a tactic,” Joe Mulhall of the anti-extremist group Hope Not Hate told me. “In the traditional sense, it doesn’t work anymore.” Every ragtag racist with a smartphone has a megaphone within easy reach, and there’s little society’s gatekeepers can do about it.Which brings us to the second challenge to the “no platform” tactic of old. The favourite refrain of every populist xenophobe from Luton to Leipzig, from Warsaw to Wisconsin? It is that they are gagged, silenced by a distant political, cultural and media establishment – one that refuses even to listen to the left behind and the left out, one that holds ordinary people in contempt for feeling anxious about immigration and what Goodwin calls “cultural displacement”.This is why “free speech” has become the single, catch-all banner under which an array of white supremacists and Islamophobes can now march, all claiming the same victimhood: that they are forbidden from voicing the pain of those betrayed by a liberal elite that imposed multiculturalism and immigration on mainly white communities in Britain, Europe and America and that now refuses even to talk about it.Which means there’s a risk that every time you disinvite Bannon or change the wording of a motion, you’re playing into the hands of the racist right, inadvertently confirming their poisonous narrative. Your intentions might be benign – to deny the right a platform – but the consequences could be the very opposite, strengthening the right by handing them sweet vindication.Mulhall says they’ve been debating this inside Hope Not Hate, aware that the no-platform tactic risks gifting bigots the very martyred ostracism they crave. But, he notes, they’ll claim that anyway, even if you invite them in and give them a seat at the table. Witness Yaxley-Lennon’s “gagged” shtick, even though his CV boasts appearances on Newsnight, Today and the Big Questions, as well as a Channel Four documentary on his daily life and a turn at the Oxford Union.The point here is that the struggle against normalisation is not quite as clear-cut as some of its most righteous warriors would have you believe. One rule of thumb might be useful though. If you give space to the far right, then ask yourself if you’re interrogating them – or echoing them. The flaw in that Conway Hall debate was a motion that took a racist canard as its starting point. Similarly, a Newsnight showed a graphic of “Tommy Robinson” with tape across his mouth, implicitly advancing his claim to have been silenced.Sometimes a society has to hear even those views it finds repellent. But it should only do so with caution, care – and with its eyes wide open."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f991da8aaf0308ccbf5839465d0e46e3970a20b/0_122_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91475091dfa51d969d50ccf5812eaa03","title":"the guardian view on chinas detention camps now we see them","story":"The courage of former inmates and relatives, and the diligence of academics, journalists and other researchers, has brought a terrible secret into plain view. As the evidence piled up of the mass extrajudicial detention of Muslim Uighurs, Kazakhs and others in China’s north-western region of Xinjiang, it was met with silence or denial from Beijing. When experts told a UN panel this August that as many as a million could be held, a Chinese official insisted that: “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”This humane idyll – a free summer camp with careers assistance – is in stark contrast to the harsh regime recorded by others. This week, a report by AFP based on tendering and other official documents found such facilities ordering razor wire, spiked clubs and restraint devices known as “tiger chairs”. Former detainees have described political indoctrination and abuse. While the government official suggested that inmates are “suspected of minor criminal offences”, released prisoners describe people being held for having relatives abroad, reciting a religious verse at a funeral or failing to pay a bill. And as parents disappear into camps, children are being taken from families and placed in de facto orphanages.The programme appears to be accelerating: the BBC suggests that the largest known camp now has room for up to 130,000 inmates and would be one of the world’s largest prisons even on a very conservative estimate. Outside, people live under the region’s extraordinary digital surveillance – including a vast network of cameras, facial recognition systems and the mass collection of biometric data – as well as under close human view.A disturbing account by an ethnographer this week detailed how more than a million Chinese officials have been sent out to stay with households in a “Becoming Family” campaign. Officials portray it as an attempt to win hearts, including through help with poverty alleviation. But they are also told to gather information on their hosts, report on “unusual situations” and carry out political propaganda work. One regional manual tells workers to inform their “little brothers and sisters” that they have been monitoring all internet and phone communications, and recommends targeting children for information. No private space of family and faith remains.These inconvenient facts have until recently been met largely with silence, including from Muslim countries. That is beginning to change. The US has raised the prospect of sanctions the new UN rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has pressed the issues others are voicing concerns. We now know what is happening. Who will act?

A cold wind gusts through the sunlit garden where we sit in Alderley Edge. Fifteen miles from Old Trafford, which the former striker still thinks of as the Theatre of Dreams, it’s just me, Cole and an emptying pot of tea. As a Manchester United player who won five league titles, the Champions League and three FA Cups, including the treble in 1999, Cole lived a fantasy life for years, even if his wounded quietness gave the wrong impression that he was surly.Yet when the 47-year-old says, “I’m never going to be the inidual I was before”, Cole is not mourning the end of his career. His lament about the “internal battle” and “torture”, which has deepened his depression and made him consider taking his own life, is rooted in ill health.Cole has accepted for the last decade that his footballing days are long gone, confined to flickering memories which provide a gloss to the solid statistics confirming he is third on the list of scorers in Premier League history, behind only Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney. He is also 12th on the all-time list of assists – primarily when playing for Manchester United or as a shy hero at Newcastle.That surgical battle might have been won but the larger war has consumed him. “I was depressed after the transplant because it’s very tough to understand the trauma you still face. I remember emptying a big bag of medication and just crying and thinking, ‘For me to survive another day, this is what I’ve got to take. For the rest of my life. I’m not sure I can continue.’“I’m still struggling emotionally. Physically I’m also struggling. No two days are the same and the medication means you’re up and down. I would never wish this on anybody because it’s a very telling experience. It brings destruction to your family life as well.”We spend 90 minutes together and Cole is a revelation in talking so openly, and with such gritty detail, about his post-transplant life. Unlike an ordinary interview with a former sportsman, Cole does not have a book or a product to plug. He is not on a mission to spread any educational message or offer an upbeat mantra about how life is now lit with serenity and hope.Cole just wants to talk so that he can “put it all out there”. He also wants to say sorry to everyone he has hurt. His family, and in particular his wife, Shirley, have suffered from all his doubts and blues. “I apologise now to everybody for being the way I’ve been. What I was doing, torturing myself over an illness, is horrible. You push them away because you’re trying to quantify what’s gone on. Eighteen months since the transplant, I know it’s a lifetime illness.”The surgical procedure of transplanting a kidney is less complicated than the post-operative battle against rejection. “Don’t forget my new kidney is a foreign object. My body attacks it. So I have to take these anti-rejection drugs to stop my body winning. People say, ‘Stay positive.’ But you never know how long your kidney will last. It could be here for five or 10 years. It could fail tomorrow. Each day you go into the unknown.Has it taken a toll on his marriage? “Massive. It pushes everything to the brink. Before, I would watch people who are depressed and suicidal and not really understand. Now I’m in the same position. Depression kicks in, you have suicidal thoughts. They understand it more than most but I’ve pushed my family to the brink. Me not telling them exactly how I feel has made this past year the toughest I’ve had.Listening to a middle-aged man open up so graphically is moving – especially when it is a former Premier League footballer who once shut himself off from the world because he felt judged. “I’ve always been quiet, and people can look on quietness as a weakness,” Cole says, considering his media image. “It’s like Raheem Sterling today. What they do to him they did to me. Some of the comments people make about you, not even knowing you, that’s the most upsetting thing about football. In my case, it’s often been, ‘He’s arrogant, difficult.’ But then people get to know you. They turn around and say, ‘You’re not like that.’”Cole does not labour the point but, as with Sterling, the suspicion lurks that racism underpins these stereotypes. His father emigrated from Jamaica to England, ending up in Nottingham, in the 1960s. “My dad never really spoke about it but when he first came over, and tried to find lodgings, he saw signs saying, ‘No blacks. No Irish. No dogs.’”After a couple of loan spells he was signed by Bristol City but, after less than a season, Newcastle broke their transfer record and signed him for £1.5m in February 1993. Cole scored a dozen goals in 12 matches to help the side, under Kevin Keegan, sweep into the Premier League. The following season he scored 32 league goals in a devastating partnership with Peter Beardsley and became a St James’ Park favourite.“It was absolutely frightening,” Cole says. “I really struggled to embrace the adulation because that’s not my bag. Even now, I struggle with adulation. I’m getting inducted into Newcastle’s hall of fame next month. Obviously I’m going to try enjoy it but it was just my job to score goals. The adulation feels surreal.”“I soon realised what it was all about. Brian Kidd, the United coach, called me over. He said: ‘Coley, if you think 41 goals a season at this club is good enough, not a chance.’ I looked at Kidd, thinking, ‘He’s got two heads, this fellow.’ But I soon understood there’s more to playing for United than scoring goals. At Newcastle I was just expected to score goals. But at Old Trafford I became a better all-round footballer.”What was it like playing for Sir Alex Ferguson? “Tough. But then I got to like him. I don’t mind managers who have a go at me if that brings the best out of me. Working with Sir Alex was an eye-opening experience. He was fantastic and the only manager I’ve ever come across who could manage different generations. But the way he spoke to us then would definitely not work now. The power is with the players now. But he was the only manager who could get the best out of me. He understood me as a person and even with the Teddy Sheringham thing he was fantastic. He mentioned it to me once and then let it go.”Cole and Sheringham were infamous for never speaking to each other despite forging a highly effective partnership up front. Cole was upset by Sheringham snubbing him as he ran on the field to make his England debut as a substitute in 1995 and never forgave him. He was close instead to Dwight Yorke and they terrorised defences in England and Europe – particularly in 1999 when United won the treble.From such career highs it was hard for Cole 18 years later on the morning of his transplant. “I had a lot of fear. All my concerns were with my family. I was thinking, ‘I’m not going to be here. So let me try to put everything in place before I’m gone.’ I was lucky my nephew was so kind giving up his kidney. They took a kidney from Alexander first and when they came for me I didn’t want to go. It really hit me. My wife was walking me down. I kept saying to her, ‘I’m not sure.’ Walking to the theatre was going into the unknown.“All I remember then is waking up with tubes up my nose. And them saying, ‘It’s a very good kidney, a big one.’ Within a few days you’re passing water properly, you’re getting better.”Cole speaks warmly of his close bond with his nephew. We also talk about, in his own words, “the upsetting trials and tribulations” that have affected his two favourite clubs, Manchester United and Newcastle, recently. But football matters little when it is set against real life.He had been close to tears an hour earlier but Cole seems stronger – if typically candid. “I’ve absolutely hated being ill. Everyone says you shouldn’t feel like that but you think, ‘Shit, I’ve let so many people down.’ But talking about it is my release.”In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Some teenagers might have moaned about having to spend their spare time mixing dough and serving customers but Elyounoussi could be found behind the counter even after playing for Sarpsborg 08’s first team. “Some of the people who were at the game came to order pizza and saw me,” he says. “There were some funny moments.”It is an amusing image, the young star removing his boots and heading for a shift at Park Pizza, but Elyounoussi is thankful to his parents for enabling him to keep his gifted feet on the ground throughout his career. He has never allowed his success to go to his head and even admits to being starstruck when he met Roger Federer during his time at Basel. “These are the values my parents gave me,” Elyounoussi says. “Always be humble. Always work hard for what you want in life.”The eldest of four children, Elyounoussi is attached to his roots and his family’s journey from Morocco to Norway. “My father’s cousin was living in Norway and he asked if my father wanted to take the chance,” he says. “It was good money in Norway. I don’t think he was really planning on settling down.”Abdelbaki Elyounoussi went on his own, found a job at Park Pizza and ended up in charge. These days, though, the locals have to go elsewhere. “There’s no more pizza business in my family,” Elyounoussi says. “I told him to have a rest and I’d take care of the bills. He went in at 9am for baking until 11am or 12pm. He came home, had lunch and then opened up at 2pm until 11pm. He always came home late. I was in bed already. When I got to a certain level and I could help him out, I said he should stop.”There was even a pizza named after Elyounoussi on the menu, although his Muslim faith means he has never tasted the Moi Special. “The toppings were actually things I can’t eat,” he says. “Ham, pepperoni, stuff like that. My father had 23 pizzas on the menu. He added No 24 and at the time that was the number on my shirt.”It is impossible not to ask whether Elyounoussi has ever been made to feel different in Norway. He arrived at the age of two and says his heart belongs to two places: where he was born and where he grew up.“I had friends and they saw me as Norwegian,” he says. “They knew I was from another part of the world. But I was always seen as a Norwegian and I learned the language very quickly. After a while my cousin Tarik and his family came over. He was about 12 or 13 and didn’t know the language. He remembers going to the airport and it being cold.”Now the Elyounoussi cousins play together for Norway. Along with Omar Elabdellaoui and Haitam Aleesami, they are a shining example of multiculturalism. The Moroccan contingent combined when Elyounoussi scored Norway’s winner against Bulgaria in the Nations League this month.There was no pressure on Elyounoussi when it came to choosing between Morocco and Norway. “I chose Norway because I played for them since the under-15s,” the 24-year-old says. “That is where I got the chance to play football. It would be great to play for Morocco as well.”The discussion moves on to playing under Brian Deane at Sarpsborg. “Even though I was 18, he put a lot of pressure on me,” Elyounoussi says. “He knew what I was capable of. He gave me examples from his career. Stuff like being focused on football and not on the stuff that comes around football, like partying and girls. He was not just a football manager, he was a like a second dad. We were that close. I haven’t had such a strong bond with my other coaches. He always told me I would play in the Premier League one day. I didn’t really believe him.”In 2014 Elyounoussi moved to Molde, who were managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The former Manchester United striker made him a more efficient finisher and that led to a transfer to Basel two years later.Elyounoussi thrived in Switzerland and he got to meet Federer, Basel’s most famous supporter. It was a big moment for a keen tennis fan. “You often remember the conversation,” Elyounoussi says. “But I was so star-struck. He was so humble.”However, Federer’s praise was not enough to keep Elyounoussi from joining Southampton for £16m in the summer. He had impressed against English opposition in the Champions League last season, scoring in Basel’s victory over Manchester City in March, and Mark Hughes needed a new creative midfielder after selling Dusan Tadic to Ajax.Elyounoussi is yet to produce his best form for Southampton, who lie a point above the bottom three before hosting Newcastle on Saturday afternoon, but he is enjoying life in England. His father has also been nosing around. “When we were in Winchester having a walk, he saw some places you could rent,” Elyounoussi says. “He said: ‘I could have a pizza restaurant here. I can move into your house.’ He was joking about moving over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2f6606f630b735792be8e43752118fffa1dce7e/865_721_1693_1016/master/1693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42bba9c0f231bc7589e6ec783d05f0e3","title":"i got my head stuck in a pumpkin","story":"I felt a jab of panic as I moved my head around trying to find the right angle. ‘I can’t get it out!’ I roaredPumpkin carving at Halloween is a family tradition. When I lived in Las Vegas, we had to make do with baseball-size ones from the grocery store. But since we moved to the north-west 10 years ago, we’ve visited a local farm every October. There we ride tractors to the pumpkin patch and I compete with my three brothers and sister to seek out the biggest specimen. My dad has a rule that we have to carry our pumpkins back to the wheelbarrow, and as the eldest child I have an advantage – in 2015 I staggered back with an 85-pounder.The following year, when I was 16, it was hard to tell whether my prize or the one chosen by my 14-year-old brother, Jason, was the winner. Unfortunately we neglected to weigh them before scooping out their innards, but I was determined to prove my point. All five of us were hard at work at the kitchen table, with my mom filming the annual ritual. I’m unsure now why I thought forcing my head inside the pumpkin would settle the matter, but it seemed to make perfect sense at the time.With the pumpkin resting on the table, hole uppermost, I leaned over and pressed my crown against the opening. At first I got jammed just above my eyes and then, as I leant into my task, unwilling to quit, my nose briefly prevented entry. Then in it popped: my whole head, like a cork forced into a bottle. I was able to straighten up, triumphantly, with the gigantic squash resting on my shoulders.My exultation was short-lived. The pumpkin was heavy. “I’m going to set it down, now,” I said, and with Jason helping to support its weight, I bent back over the table to give it somewhere to rest. It was only when I tried to remove my head that I realised getting out was going to be less straightforward than getting in. The knot of my ponytail caught against the rim when I tried to pull out, as did the underside of my jaw. When I pulled my chin into my neck, my nose got in the way instead. I felt a jab of panic as I braced against the table and moved my head around trying to find the right angle, but it was no use. “I can’t get it out!” I roared, my voice sounding unnaturally loud in the enclosed space. The muffled voices from outside were oddly calming, though – Mom unruffled and amused, Jason giving advice, my 10-year-old brother, Austin, singing a song I couldn’t make out. There was enough space around my neck to let a little light in and, fortunately, I’ve always liked the smell of pumpkin. My bellowing provoked little sympathy. “Don’t use up all your oxygen,” Mom suggested.Dad was summoned – less, it seemed, in expectation of practical help than to make sure he didn’t miss out on the spectacle. I heard him propose calling the fire department. “Stay tuned,” said Mom she’d mentioned she was going to upload the video to Facebook, but it was only then I realised she’d been filming the whole time. I was stuck for five or six minutes though it felt much, much longer. The video cuts before my rescue – Dad got me to push my head farther into the pumpkin so Mom could reach in and undo the rubber band round my ponytail. I emerged with squash-conditioned hair, a sore chin and my nose plugged with pulp.That Facebook video went up the Monday before Halloween, and by the end of that day it had over 1,000 views. People asked Mom to put it on YouTube, and by Wednesday morning we were getting 5am calls from TV breakfast shows and then the international media – the video started racking up hundreds of thousands of views. When I went on a youth camp, I was recognised by children I’d never met. The pumpkin also became a minor celebrity. Passersby and trick-or-treaters would knock and ask, “Which is Rachel’s pumpkin?” before taking selfies with it.Although our pumpkin carving the following year was a more sedate affair, I wouldn’t say I learned my lesson. A few months later I squeezed myself into a laundry basket during a game of hide-and-seek and became hopelessly jammed. It was Dad who responded to my cries for help. Inevitably, I was kept waiting for a while – first he had to look for the video camera.• As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

FOFP had submitted a list of 20 suggested conditions “to make it a more manageable event for the community”, said chair Simon Hunt, a philosophy student at Oxford. These included a reduction in the number of attendees, an earlier Sunday curfew, stricter noise monitoring, the provision of free tap water, a ban on cigarette sales, a tougher drug enforcement policy and a watershed-style restriction on performers using bad language.Of FOFP’s recommendations, only the noise monitoring and the Sunday curfew were enforced. A new line was added to strengthen an existing clause on vulgar language, specifically prohibiting its amplification, “following complaints that swearing could be heard outside the event”, said a spokesperson for Haringey council. It was this clause, brought to public attention for the first time, that provoked outcry: stating that the licensee must reasonably request that performers not perform vulgar material or banned songs, make vulgar gestures or remarks, and ensure that “the attire of the performers do not offend the general public, eg attire which exposes the groin, private parts, buttock or female breast(s)”.It seemed like the latest instance of black music censorship in England’s capital. The lyrics in drill music have been blamed for a rise in youth gang violence, leading police to seek court orders banning certain groups from making music. In November 2017, form 696, a risk-assessment form for promoters widely regarded as enforcing racial discrimination, was scrapped after a decade. However, the clause forbidding swearing and skimpy clothing is common to all premises agreements between the event’s promoter, Festival Republic (a subsidiary of Live Nation), and Haringey council since 2014: it equally applied to concerts by Liam Gallagher and Queens of the Stone Age in Finsbury Park this summer.Festival Republic’s MD, Melvin Benn, said that the promoter always “encourages the non-use of swearing”. But licensing lawyer Gerald Gouriet QC described such a clause as too broad to be enforceable. “How can you know what’s going to offend the general public?” he said. “The reason any licensee doesn’t mind such a condition is because he complies if he makes the request: if someone’s about to go on stage and swear, and the licensee says, ‘I request that you don’t’, and the rapper goes on and does it, the licensee isn’t in breach.”Licensing authorities can only impose conditions that promote the objectives in section four of the Licensing Act 2003: the prevention of crime and disorder, public safety, prevention of public nuisance and protection of children from harm. Said Gouriet: “While a licensing committee may get hot under the collar about a rapper using swear words, unless they can say that the use of those swear words is likely to impose crime and disorder and impact on public safety, then it’s none of their business. There’s a lot of unrealistic reliance on the licensing objectives.”The developments have been met with a heated response. London-based youth worker Ciaran Thapar likened the restrictions on expression to politicians scapegoating drill musicians’ use of language “rather than trying to understand where that language might come from”. Newham rapper Kojo Funds described profanity as “part of the way people express their feelings in their music … swear words can help you release stress or anger, instead of bringing it out in a physical form.”“The implications of censoring the appearance of female rappers and R\u0026ampB singers is inherently racist,” said Channing Hargrove, a New York-based writer. “Black women’s bodies are constantly being policed.” However, Jamaican-born rapper Lisa Mercedez, who performed at Wireless 2018, said she would have no issue with censoring herself. “There’s a lot of underage kids at these festivals so I think it’s a good thing. We’re smart enough to use our words instead of showing our bodies and swearing.”FOFP will appeal the council’s review. Hunt said Wireless was not being targeted because of its style of music but for the disturbance it causes. “We had lots of families writing to us saying, ‘I don’t want my children listening to what’s being said at these festivals’ – language that was in some cases abusive, misogynistic.”Hunt, 21, stressed that he was a fan of grime music. “Maybe the fact that I’m a younger person shows that it’s not just old people complaining about the racket in their back garden, it’s affecting the whole community.” Haringey councillor Kirsten Hearn said: “Wireless festival is a world-class urban event that helps to fund the park the whole year round and makes a major cultural contribution to Hackney.” Melvin Benn said the lineup for Wireless 2019 was already booked. “There is no question of it not going ahead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df6d17b375ae0554a61fbedf368ae2fdd376feb4/0_0_3500_2498/master/3500.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4c8c1e965b40ac146fd43f5ddbb166e7 1320w","title":"astronomy photographer of the year 2018 the winning images","story":"The US photographer Brad Goldpaint has beaten thousands of amateur and professional photographers from around the globe to win the Royal Observatory Greenwich’s title of Insight Investment Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2018.

While not yet out of the woods as regards the fallout, the all-rounder hopes match-winning England performances can help reshape his public image.It is 13 months since a post-match drinking session turned sour in the early hours outside a nightclub and having been found not guilty of affray at Bristol crown court in August following a well publicised trial, one final chapter in the saga remains.After the tour of Sri Lanka Stokes and his ODI teammate Alex Hales will stand in front of the Cricket Discipline Commission in London in December when they will face two charges of bringing the sport into disrepute sporting sanctions, including fines and suspensions, could follow.Despite Trevor Bayliss describing the conclusion of the summer’s court case as a “wake-up call” for Stokes and urging a public show of contrition, the player has kept his counsel. Whether this is for fear of prejudicing the CDC process, and thus an apology would follow after the conclusion, remains to seen.“Everything you do from here onwards is what people will hopefully remember. That’s what I’m trying to do. As I said, it’s a big year coming up, two important things – a World Cup and an Ashes – and with both being in England it’s really exciting.”As well as reiterating how much it means to play for his country, Stokes admitted he has been grateful to his teammates for their support over the past year. Missing last winter’s Ashes tour left the Test side without their talisman in a crushing 4-0 defeat but there has never been so much as a grumble from a colleague.Asked if he had a message to the England fans, Stokes simply offered, “I will try to win as many games as I can”, and in this regard the England management believe the player witnessed pre-Bristol is ready to re-emerge.His batting during the 3-1 one-day series win over Sri Lanka appeared to be returning to its fluent best – a bout of cramp during his 60-ball 67 on Tuesday notwithstanding – although Stokes insists his summer strike rate of 41 in the India Tests was due to the bowler-friendly conditions rather than the stop-start nature of the last year.“It’s nice knowing I have got that self-control,” he said. “It’s not how I try to base my game but it is what the situation called for. I think I realised it’s easier to adapt rather than just go out there and say, ‘I am going to play the way I am known for’.On how he views his role in future, Stokes added: “Being the player who wants to impact every game is what I’ve always tried to be. I don’t want to look back on my career and say, ‘I wish I’d averaged this or that’.“I’d rather be remembered as a player who came on and impacted a lot of games for England. If I ever take a selfish thought-process of, ‘I’m doing this for myself’, then things will be seriously wrong.”Before England’s attention turns fully to the first Test in Galle on 6 November and the white-ball specialists depart, there is Saturday’s one-off Twenty20 international to negotiate.Chris Jordan has flown in for this single fixture, while Joe Root will likely step aside as he recovers from a minor thumb injury. After an eight-year hiatus, Joe Denly should also get his chance.Sri Lanka are expected to hand an international debut to Kamindu Mendis, the ambidextrous all-rounder who switches between left- and right-arm finger spin if the usual evening storms arrive for this 7pm (BST) start, amphibious cricketers may be required."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6499e11a3b16ff598e28b49e9379b2a3c0f4b4ac/611_907_3976_2388/master/3976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72f81a10ef59dcd0e82e0475c333ca8c","title":"how simone biles came to wield incomparable influence in gymnastics","story":"The 21-year-old is known for her skills in competition but such is her status she is now influencing how gymnastics is governedPlenty of athletes have the power to transform their sports. LeBron James changes the balance of power in the NBA every time he moves teams. Serena Williams has forced tennis to confront issues of racism and sexism. Neymar’s contract demands may soon affect global GDP rankings.We should now include a 4ft 8in 21-year-old on that list. Through a perfect storm of circumstances – a strong claim to be the greatest ever in her sport and a series of misadventures in her national federation – she wields incomparable influence. She’s Simone Biles, and she is changing gymnastics in innumerable ways.When the American competes at the World Gymnastics Championships in Doha this week, few of her competitors will have any hope of challenging her. On the mat and various apparatuses, she is beyond comparison. She literally rewrote gymnastics’ history at the age of 16, when she added a new, fiendishly difficult leaping tumble to the sport’s code of points in the same year she won the first of her three successive World Championship all-round titles. She was one of the stars – in any sport – of the 2016 Rio Olympics, winning four gold medals. She took a break in 2017, but has returned to competition this year and is as dominant as ever.It’s away from the gyms and arena that she’s truly flexing her muscles. She has spoken about her difficult childhood – she entered foster care at the age of three before she was eventually adopted by her maternal grandparents – and has worked with organisations that help children in similar situations.But it was this month, when USA Gymnastics appointed a new interim presidentCEO, that Biles’s influence became clear. Mary Bono, a former gymnast and Republican congresswoman, was appointed to the position on 12 October. She didn’t last long. The next day, gymnastics fans found a tweet of Bono drawing over a Nike swoosh in response to the company’s campaign featuring quarterback-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick. Biles offered a short but pointed response on Twitter: “Don’t worry, it’s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,” she wrote.Bono promptly deleted her original tweet, but a headline in Deadspin summed up the situation in US gymnastics: “Simone Biles Has All The Power, And She Knows It.” Fellow Olympic champion Aly Raisman then followed up Biles’s lead. She attacked Bono for her ties to a consulting firm she accused of failing to act on the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal while it worked with USA Gymnastics. On 16 October, Bono resigned. Under fire from Biles and Raisman, her reign hadn’t even lasted a week.Even before the Bono incident Biles had emerged as a fearsome force for change within USA Gymnastics in the wake of the Nassar sexual-abuse scandal, which shook the sport to its core. Biles wasn’t the first athlete to say she was a survivor of Nassar, the longtime USA Gymnastics team doctor who pled guilty to sexual-abuse charges and is now serving an effective life sentence for his crimes. That would be Rachel Denhollander, who broke the long-standing silence on Nassar and eventually opened the floodgates for a wave of survivors to tell their stories, many of them Olympic medalists.Raisman has taken the most direct approach to confronting not just Nassar but those who failed to stop him. In a blistering testimony at Nassar’s sentencing hearing in January, Raisman calmly and firmly ripped into the disgraced doctor before she turned her attention to USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee for their failure to stop the abuse. In March, she sued both organizations along with Nassar and two former USA Gymnastics officials – president Steve Penny and board chairman Paul Parilla. (Penny was arrested this month, accused of tampering with evidence in the Nassar investigation.)While Biles did not appear at Nassar’s hearing to tell her story of abuse under his care, she has made a powerful impact, using her position as the sport’s biggest star to change gymnastics, often with an economy of words.In August, two days before the US Championships, Biles responded to a question about the overhauled management of USA Gymnastics – including Kerry Perry, who had been named presidentCEO in November 2017 and had been criticised for her inaction over the Nassar scandal. With a succinct but withering statement Biles said: “Hopefully, it’s going in the right direction but nobody can know until Kerry Perry speaks up. It’s kind of hard.” Biles was then asked if Perry should step up and speak more. “Yes,” Biles said. “It’s her job.” Less than a month later Perry resigned.Biles’s comments certainly weren’t the only factor in Perry’s exit. Raisman and Denhollander spoke up again when USA Gymnastics hired Mary Lee Tracy, a coach who complimented Nassar shortly after his indictment in 2016, as elite development coordinator. Each called the appointment “a slap in the face.” But throughout this time, Biles was finding her voice. While sweeping the gold medals at the US Championships in August, she wore a teal leotard, intentionally selecting a color that has emerged as a symbol of strength for sexual-abuse survivors.Biles’s implicit support of Kaepernick during Bono’s attack on the quarterback is interesting. Although the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback’s activism has attracted far more attention than Biles’s own foray into social issues, her impact has arguably been more concrete. Kaepernick deserves immense credit for influencing the national conversation on race and freedom of expression in America, but the NFL has dug in its heels on national anthem protests and he is still without a team. Biles, in contrast, has helped remove two CEOs from her sport’s governing body, advocated for abuse survivors and arrives in Doha as the finest gymnast in the world.She clearly isn’t going away either: she has spoken of her desire to compete at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. It’s a safe bet she won’t be silent – or powerless – in the run-up to the Games, and perhaps for years to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6b03249c06a4635ee6e10f777602ecb793f0ab9/208_0_3704_2222/master/3704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b476214cec9f8e60e1ad8ea909de3690","title":"lewis hamilton finishing high five mexico","story":"Ten years since Lewis Hamilton won his first Formula One world championship he is almost certainly but days from a fifth. He goes into Sunday’s Mexican Grand Prix as already the most successful British driver and will likely emerge from the grand, noisy, colourful maelstrom of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez behind only Michael Schumacher in the record books and level with Juan Manuel Fangio. The Mercedes man is taking nothing for granted but ominously for his competitors he suggested in Mexico he now has his sights set on greater glories.Hamilton has to finish only seventh to secure his fifth title, while Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel must win just to stay in the game. Hamilton was the champion elect at the previous grand prix in the US but a combination of car problems and strategy calls denied him a coronation. Nothing short of a DNF is likely to do so on Sunday and, if he does close it out, he will have equalled Fangio and stand only two behind Schumacher.Hamilton took his first F1 title for McLaren in 2008 in his second season but did not win another until 2014, a year after he had switched to Mercedes, a move considered questionable at the time but has since proved positively prescient.Two further championships followed but he has always been reticent to suggest how far he can go. In Mexico, however, when asked how he felt now, a decade on from that first title, he gave an emphatic indication he is more motivated then ever.“I’ve still got more to do. There are so many different things that happened in that time and I waited a long time to get the second,” he said. “I could easily have stayed where I was and I wouldn’t be sitting here with the ones I have now. It’s been interesting, the journey and the different decisions I have taken, but I am very grateful for the route I have been on. I feel incredibly fortunate to be in the position I am in but I feel like I have quite a lot left to do.”He has always denied targeting Schumacher’s record but with his contract with Mercedes set to run until the end of 2020, it is hard not to imagine he must believe it is achievable. Hamilton is 20 wins behind the German’s record of 91 and between 2014 and 2017 he has averaged 10 a year, with nine this season already.It is an extraordinary achievement, unimaginable to the 22-year-old who took to the grid in 2007. He showed such huge promise then, but now 33, has developed into one of the most complete drivers of his generation. This season he has driven as well if not better than at any point in his career.He has been on an exceptional run of form to reach this position, winning six of the seven races before the US Grand Prix, and there is no reason to think he and Mercedes will not conclusively finish the job in Mexico. Their car has been almost bulletproof this year, with only one DNF for Hamilton after a fuel-pressure problem in Austria. His lowest finish was fifth in Canada, one of only three races in which he failed to claim a top-three spot.These are results that reflect the special place he occupies as a sportsman, something in which he is revelling. “Even though you’re improving, the competition improves, different circumstances arise,” he said. “But this year particularly has been one of the most enjoyable years with the things that I have been faced with. So if I were to win the title, I think it would definitely be one I would be probably most proud of and be able to appreciate most.”Finishing with a win is far from a given. Ferrari enjoyed the better pace in Texas, where Kimi Räikkönen won after they rolled back upgrades brought to the car since Singapore, and they will expect to be strong again in Mexico, where Red Bull also will be competitive. The thinner air owing to the altitude of Mexico City helps reduce the power disadvantage of Red Bull’s Renault engine and they have targeted the race as one where they expect to compete at the front.Red Bull did indeed prove quick out of the box. Max Verstappen topped the timesheets with Daniel Ricciardo in second in both practice sessions. Hamilton was in seventh on his qualifying simulation in the afternoon with his team-mate Valtteri Bottas in ninth, while Vettel was in fourth with Raikkonen in eighth in practice two."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9edd19654bb88062fc3f27d6127765506f1f93ac/0_171_4879_2928/master/4879.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45d626a7e8a3ae928ee1fd2f58eabb64","title":"world series game 3 boston red sox v los angeles dodgers live","story":"A 99mph heater that nearly hit Muncy: he may have considered leaning in there.

Holt is coming around and scores!And Nunez is shaken up again from bursting down the line when he was already hurt.This all started with a free pass. Remember what I wrote about leadoff walks being the main ingredient in a recipe for disaster?Still no outs in the 13th and a runner on first. Bradley is up!It’s scorted a base hit for Nunez and an error on the pitcher Alexander who made the throw...Ball in the dirt, Holt goes! Nunez was upended during the action around the plate. Barnes was chasing the ball and basically took Nunez out from under him. Wild play. The trainers are looking at him - he has to play! There are no other fielders on the bench!So runner on second and 1-0 to Nunez, nobody out. Nunez will stay in. Brock Holt, who has played infield and outfield tonight, walks!

Kike grounds behind the bag at first: Vazquez, who is making his first ever appearance at first base, makes a nice play and tosses to Eovaldi. That’s out no1. Here’s Pederson - he’s quickly in the hole 1-2. FOX TV in the US says this is the longest World Series game in terms of innings in the 57-year history of Dodger Stadium. Pederson skies to center: two outs. Nathan Eovaldi is in, and Sandy Leon comes into catch - he’s the last man on the Red Sox bench, so they’re on empty. It’s Eovaldi’s game now.

Puig pops to Betts who, at least for now, is in right field. That could change, believe me.  Now Barnes is up for his first at bat of the evening. Full count to Bellinger who grounds right into the shift on the right side, Kinsler handles and fires to first for out no1. Heath Hembree is in for the Sox in relief of Kimbrel who got it done tonight. He is ahead on Bellinger 1-2...FOX TV in the US reports that more than 20 dozen baseballs have been used, considerably more than the usual 10 dozen that are usually spent. Now back to the action...Betts pops to center. Side retired. Bellinger, who has been in the middle of it all as of late, leads off the Dodgers 11th. Baez remains in for LA and he strikes out Bradley, who tied this game in the eighth with that soul-destroying strike to LA’s playoff hopes. But they’re still playing and could still cut the Sox series lead in half...Now Vazquez grounds out to short. Here comes Steve Pearce off the bench. Kimbrel left it out over the plate: that was a pitch to hit but Machado pops it a mile high in the infield: Boraerts has it, inning over!Another missed offensive opportunity for LA. This is not goinng to end well for these guys, me thinks. More outfield defensive maneuvering. Bradley in left, Betts in center, and Holt in right. Two foul balls from an aggressive Machado and it’s 0-2. He’s gotta make Kimbrel work more. Muncy, a line shot: it bounces up and over the wall for a two-out double!Now Cora walks Machado intentionally with first base open...oh wait, he doesn’t. That’s who you want to beat you?Now Turner bounces to third, and that’s two outs with Max Muncy heading to the plate. Kimbrel gets Pederson to pop up. One down. Turner is next. Nunez skies to center: is it deep enough?Bellinger waits, Kinsler tags, the throw is IN TIME!WOW! What a throw by Bellinger who burned LA by being picked off earlier in a big spot during the Dodger ninth, and then comes up huge in an even bigger situation! Bellinger may have saved this game and perhaps the series!So runners at the corners, one out, Devers out, Nunez in. Righty v righty and LA could use a strikeout or a pop up. There goes Kinsler, pitch, and a base hit up the middle!Kinsler is heading into third, the throw is off, but now Turner has the wise throw, he waits, then goes to tag Kinsler who ran off the bag!Is he safe? The ump says yet! They’re not going to challenge! The lead run is 90 feet away for the BoSox. Nunez pinch hits, and we know what happened last time...The call is safe, and that’s probably right. It was super close, and not enough to overturn the call on the field. So a man on with one out Baez faces Holt. Was Ian Kinsler picked off? Max Muncy thinks so: he’s throwing the ball around the infield, he’s that confident. I’m not sure there’s enough to overturn a safe call. This should be interesting...Baez walks Martinez, who will pinch run for Martinez. Kinsler can’t be much of a speed daemon: perhaps that tels you something about JD’s ankle, although he did play all night in the OF. Pedro Baez is in to pitch for LA and face Moreland. Baez, so good in Game 1, was removed for Alex Wood, who gave up the home run to Eduardo Nunez. Then a night later, he sat on the bench while Ryan Madson gave up huge runs for a second straight night. Moreland pops to Puig in right field. Kimbrel leaves it over the plate but Dozier pops it up! Vazquez has it and we’re going to exrtra innings! Bellinger, Bellinger, Bellinger and missed Dodger opportunities. Kimbrel, big silver chain, and an even bigger red beard, stares in at Dozier. Roberts is going to pinch run and bring Austin Barnes in to get a bit more speed. The Dodgers could win this with a. base hit, and Brian Dozier steps to the plate to pinch hit for the pitcher. The Sox move Betts to center defensively. It’s 3-2 to Taylor. Chris Taylor faces Kimbrel with two down and a catcher on first base...it’s 1-2. I cannot believe he got picked off there. That is such a killer! Can’t happen. No no no, it CANNOT happen! Basic baseball. Grandal walks, and here comes Cora to get Price.Kimbrel on his way in, into a tie game, on the road. Bellinger is picked off! He left way too early. Man you can NOT get caught like that! Come on!Roberts can’t believe it, 56,000 fans in LA can’t believe it. Full count. Huge rip from Grandal is fouled straight back. He just missed that one, oh boy. Full count now. 3-0, and the next pitch is outside but called a strike!It’s 2-0 to Grandal...Everybody up in LA...Price left it up and over but Puig missed it: it’s a harmless pop to right field for the first out. The switch-hitting Grandal is batting right handed, his weaker side. Boston have a chat at the mound to try and figure this all out.

Angelina Cruz, who runs the teachers’ union in town, says people seem more receptive on the doorstep this time than in the recent past. Erin Forrest, the executive director of Emerge Wisconsin, which encourages and trains Democratic women to run for public office, believes voters are finally making the connection between the fallout from austerity and the Republican governor, Scott Walker, who advanced it.In a range of ways, Democrats here feel that something is different this time.“In 2016 a lot of people felt their vote didn’t matter,” said Cruz. “Now we tell them it’s so close and you should try to get a friend or a family member to come to the polls with you. And they are listening. I think in the context of Trump and all the things he’s done, people feel powerless and this is something you can do.”Most describe a mood of cautious optimism. Democrats in Wisconsin maintain a tight but narrow lead in the governor’s race, seem to be running away with the Senate race, and even feel they have an outside shot at the seat of the outgoing House speaker, Paul Ryan, in which Racine sits. Things look good. But they have been here before.Most progressives here have a story of waking up the morning after election day two years ago to find Wisconsin had not only voted Republican for the first time in more than 30 years – it had voted for Donald Trump. For many it changed what they felt about the state they had lived in all their lives. “I remember being in public spaces and looking around and thinking, ‘Which of these white people voted for that crazy person who hates everything that I am?’” said Cruz.Activists and union organisers surprised themselves with their response. Flooding in from around the state they occupied the capitol, unleashing a series of protests lasting several months. Those were heady times.“Suddenly a labor movement and a core of allies people thought had faded into the background sprang to life,” said Ben Wikler, a native Wisconsinite and the Washington director of MoveOn.Org. “I remember being at the capitol, looking at a sea of people fanning out all across downtown Madison. Sleeping overnight on the concrete floor, walls covered in Post-It notes sending support to their fellow workers, students rallying alongside their teachers and retirees rallying alongside their kids.”If Walker was Trump before Trump, then “the uprisings” in Madison that year were the resistance before the resistance. “The Wisconsin resistance fought against neoliberalism,” says John Nichols, the Madison-based columnist for the Nation. “It was a resistance against austerity and austerity-like politics even if people didn’t even necessarily have the words for it back then.”The energy from the Madison protests was poured into an effort to recall Walker – a provision some states have for effectively demanding a revote. But Walker not only beat off the recall, he was returned with a larger majority and then re-elected in 2014. Then came Trump’s victory in 2016.So the caution arises not simply from not winning, but having felt the camaraderie of mass protest only to be followed by electoral defeat: it’s not just the depths to which things have fallen but the heights from which the mood fell. So in Wisconsin particularly, when they see four of the five of the largest marches in American history take place in the last two years and sense increased enthusiasm they don’t assume that this will translate into a blue wave. They’re not jaded. But they are reflective.“As important as every election cycle is,” explained Forrest. “You can’t live cycle to cycle. Whenever something like the uprising or the recall vote happens there’s a wave of new people that come in. And some of them go back out. But there is an infusion of new blood, and new energy and new ideas.”Historically, it has generally taken some time for electoral politics to catch up with movement politics, explains Nichols, pointing to how long it took after the civil rights protests emerged for civil rights legislation to be passed or the election of Nixon in the midst of the anti-war campaign. But just because progressives haven’t been winning elections doesn’t mean what they have been doing has made no difference.This has been particularly true for women, explained Forrest, who saw an exponential increase in applications for her programme to train and support Democratic women following Trump’s election and a subsequent huge increase in women running for office. “A lot of women became inspired. And a lot became fed up. Either way they decided they wanted to do something about it.”The optimism comes partly from most feeling that they have more relatable candidates and partly from feeling that while they were demonstrating against the threat of Walker’s policies, it has taken some time for the reality to hit home.But in no small part the optimism and the cautiousness are related. They have been here before. So far, early voting in Democratic strongholds is up on 2014 in Milwaukee and Madison. Bernie Sanders was in Kenosha, next door to Racine on Monday Obama is in Milwaukee, just 45 minutes away, on Friday.“They are so sick of losing here,” said Wikler. “I wish we’d seen this energy in 2016. But now nobody’s taking anything for granted. And as a result there’s more energy. More volunteers. People understand the stakes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d69d5c047c5dfc6db00b8f8214a739659618b0b/64_0_1872_1123/master/1872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f1ef17e3d39a7759bbdd199d244c216","title":"suspicious package pipe bombs latest found cory booker florida","story":"An avowed Donald Trump supporter in southern Florida was charged on Friday with sending pipe bombs to critics of the president, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.Thirteen of the devices were mentioned on a federal criminal complaint. A 14th device was reported by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who has called for Trump’s impeachment.Cesar Sayoc was arrested at an auto parts shop in the city of Plantation on Friday morning. His white van, which was covered in stickers celebrating Republicans and denouncing the president’s opponents, was parked outside.Sayoc, 56, has an address in the Miami suburb of Aventura and an extensive arrest record. According to his social media accounts, he works as a booking agent for a live events company and is a former wrestler and cage fighter.Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, said at a press conference in Washington Sayoc had been charged with five offences including threats against former presidents, assaulting current and former federal officers and mailing explosives. The charges were filed to federal court in Manhattan.“Let this be a lesson to anyone, regardless of their political beliefs, that we will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats, intimidation and outright violence to further an agenda,” Sessions said.Asked why most of Sayoc’s alleged targets were Democrats, Sessions said: “He appears to be a partisan.” A court filing said the stickers covering Sayoc’s van included “images critical of CNN”, the TV station frequently derided by Trump, whose New York studios were the target of two bombs.Speaking at the White House, Trump praised the “incredible job” done by investigators and promised to punish the person responsible. Speaking later at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump won applause from his loyalist supporters for calling for national unity and an end to political violence. But he soon attacked the media, encouraged chants of “CNN sucks” and set the audience up to boo the Democratic House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and reprise “lock her up” chants aimed at Hillary Clinton.FBI director Christopher Wray said Sayoc had been linked by a fingerprint to a package sent to the California congresswoman Maxine Waters. DNA possibly from Sayoc was also found in one of the packages, Wray said, stressing that they contained authentic explosives.“These are not hoax devices,” Wray said, adding that more could yet be in the mail.Three bombs were confirmed by authorities when charges were brought, bringing to 13 the number known to have been sent. None exploded before being found and no injuries were reported.The packages found on Friday were sent to two senators, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California to James Clapper, a former director of national intelligence. Steyer, a donor to Democratic groups, said an additional suspect package addressed to him was intercepted in Burlingame, California.Sayoc was born in Brooklyn, New York, and registered as a Republican in 2016, according to public records. His social media accounts contain photographs and video clips in which he is wearing Trump’s signature red baseball cap with the slogan “Make America Great Again”.The 56-year-old has also posted material online denigrating Muslims and raising popular rightwing conspiracy theories including the false claim that Clinton killed a former deputy White House counsel, Vince Foster.He threatened CNN in a tweet in August. Rochelle Ritchie, a former aide to Democratic politicians, said on Friday she reported Sayoc to Twitter earlier this year after he warned her: “Hug your loved ones real close every time you leave you home.” Twitter told her Sayoc had not violated its rules. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.Sayoc’s arrest record stretches back more than 25 years and includes charges for theft, battery, domestic violence and other offences. In August 2002, he was found guilty of making a bomb threat to a utilities worker.Daniel Lurvey, an attorney who represented Sayoc in some of his criminal cases, said Sayoc had been “normal and courteous” and did not seem politically angry. “I think it’s a recent phenomenon that’s happening to a lot of people who have feelings under the surface that are brought out by this isive political climate,” said Lurvey.On Friday afternoon, police and security guards were blocking off an upmarket 27-story condominium block in Aventura, where Sayoc has been listed as a resident.Neighbours said they were surprised. But one, Dan Ochsenschlagen, said there had been friction on the condominium board between Sayoc’s mother, the registered owner of the apartment, and other board members. Ochsenschlagen said Sayoc’s mother, who often made political statements, was president of the board for 17 years until she was voted out last December.“Some of the things that were going on were very questionable,” Ochsenschlagen said. He said he had reported what he called “financial irregularities” to police in Miami.  was not immediately able to verify the claims.Authorities hoped Sayoc’s arrest would end the steady discovery of more matching envelopes, containing what appeared to be pipes packed with explosives and connected to wires, across the US. The criminal complaint against Sayoc said the packages included photographs of the targets’ faces that had been crossed out with a red “X”.The first package was discovered on Monday in a mailbox at the New York home of George Soros, a wealthy liberal donor. It was followed by similar packages intercepted by the secret service that were addressed to the homes of Obama and Clinton.Over the following days packages were found addressed to former vice-president Joe Biden, former attorney general Eric Holder, former CIA director John Brennan, Waters and the actor Robert De Niro. All are high-profile opponents of Trump.The package addressed to Booker was intercepted in Florida while the one for Clapper was discovered at a post office in Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan. It was addressed to Clapper at the offices of CNN, a few blocks away, where he is employed as an analyst.CNN’s Manhattan offices were evacuated on Wednesday when another suspected pipe bomb was sent there, meant for Brennan. Both former intelligence officials have been outspoken critics of Trump’s actions in office. Clapper on Friday said the packages were part of campaign of “domestic terrorism” intended to sow fear.“This is not going to silence the administration’s critics,” Clapper told CNN. “But anyone who has in any way been a public critic of President Trump needs to be on extra alert and take some precautions particularly with respect to mail.”Clapper praised the FBI for its work and for persevering in the face of abuse from the president. Trump has accused the FBI of being involved in a “deep state” conspiracy to undermine him and of botching an inquiry into a private email server used by Clinton. “Will the FBI ever recover its once stellar reputation?” he asked in a tweet in August.Shortly before the arrest, Trump complained that the attempted bombings were damaging his party’s prospects for next month’s midterm elections. He also appeared to stoke conspiracy theories.“Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this ‘Bomb’ stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows – news not talking politics. Very unfortunate, what is going on. Republicans, go out and vote!”, Trump said. The president had also complained in a 3am tweet he was being unfairly blamed for the attempted bombings.The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said Trump’s reaction was “wholly inappropriate” and showed he had “never fully made the transition” to being presidential. “Am I hopeful that the zebra changes his or her stripes today? No,” Cuomo said on CNN.Supporters of Trump speculated without evidence that the devices were not viable and could not have harmed people. Cuomo said: “No one can say that they were fake bombs. These were dangerous devices that could explode.”De Niro made his first remarks on the pipe bomb discovered at his offices in lower Manhattan. “I thank God no one’s been hurt, and I thank the brave and resourceful security and law enforcement people for protecting us,” he said. “There’s something more powerful than bombs, and that’s your vote. People must vote!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places.

Joyous, of course, unless you are a parent of small children, own pets, are working a night-shift over the weekend, or don’t like the trade off of earlier sunsets for a bit more morning light.2018 may mark one of the final times that the continent of Europe changes the clocks back in unison with the UK – or indeed at all, as moves are afoot to abolish daylight saving time in the EU.Since 2002, EU Directive 200084EC has regulated the time change between winter and summer time in the EU, stating that the last weekend in March and the last weekend in October should be the switchover dates. But a 2017 report by the European parliament into the practice has led to the European parliament voting that daylight savings time arrangement be reconsidered, allowing member states to opt out of changing their clocks. Some non-EU European countries, like Russia, Turkey, Belarus and Iceland, have already abandoned the practice.The argument in favour of the harmonising the clock change across the EU is that it helps the single market to function, and is beneficial to the transport sector, especially cross-border, while also making some energy savings.But scientists and politicians have become increasingly worried on the impact it has on the human sleep cycle. In 2016 an investigation by the German Bundestag concluded that “the process of adaptation to the time change might be more difficult for some people than has been assumed in earlier years”.Researchers had previously thought that the clock change, particularly in spring, caused people to suffer minor jet-lag style symptoms for a couple of days after the change. They now think, according to the Bundestag report, that the effects can last up to four weeks, and that “for some people the process of adaptation itself takes place only insufficiently or not at all”.While not the highest consideration in Brexit talks over the Irish border, it raises the possibility that in the future Dublin could have to choose between abolishing daylight savings time and creating a time-zone border with Northern Ireland, or retaining it and being out of step with the time zones of some fellow EU states.Changing the clocks seems set to stay in the UK. It is just over 100 years since the concept of changing the clocks was introduced by the 1916 Summer Time Act, and there doesn’t appear to be any great groundswell of opinion among British politicians about changing domestic arrangements for British summer time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66f1cfe1a2a73c01bdd3dbbe8e824bb13a72842e/0_370_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5fd635b4d898ad3823725ee1d7d3fae","title":"from forgotten breed to game of thrones how one woman saved icelands goats","story":"Thanks to pioneering farmer Jóhanna Thorvaldsdóttir, a heritage breed facing extinction now graces Reykjavík’s top menus – via an appearance in the HBO showIn Reykjavík, Icelandic goat is increasingly appearing on the menus of the city’s best restaurants. At the contemporary restaurant Nostra, dried goat hearts get shaved over grilled cucumber, while at Dill, Iceland’s first Michelin star restaurant, goat cheese is served alongside beets and crowberries.Krauma, a geothermal bath and spa facility in the western part of the country, has become one of the biggest buyers of products from Háafell, Iceland’s first commercial goat farm. One of its signature dishes is an Icelandic goat platter, with thinly sliced goat meat that has been cured with thyme, salt and sugar like a carpaccio, as well as rosemary smoked goat, goat sausage, goat feta cheese and pickled vegetables.“We try to keep it local, and people are curious about the goat,” says Franklin Margrétarson, the chef of Krauma’s restaurant.For the first time since Háafell’s owner Jóhanna Thorvaldsdóttir took in four Icelandic goats in 1999, she is making a profit from them. Goat cheese, ice-cream, meat and the breed’s cashmere-like hair are bringing in money to help care for the animals, as are increasing numbers of tourists stopping for a tour to see a unique heritage breed that very nearly disappeared.Brought by the Vikings from Norway when they settled 1,100 years ago, the Icelandic, or Settlement, goat was once widespread in the country. However, a mini ice age that began in the 1300s and lasted for several centuries made living in Iceland quite difficult. The fattier meat of the sheep was in high demand and goats fell out of favour. Numbers dwindled over the centuries and by 1962 there were just 70-80 left in the entire country.When Thorvaldsdóttir acquired her first four, the country’s remaining goats were spread out on more than 40 isolated farms. There were inbreeding problems and many infections. The breed could easily have become extinct.Thorvaldsdóttir decided to leave her job as a nurse, and began breeding goats. There was little income, but her flock grew to several hundred strong. Then, after Iceland’s financial collapse, interest rates sky-rocketed, and in 2014 her farm was in foreclosure.The food writer Jody Eddy, who had visited the farm while writing a book, launched a crowdfunding campaign. Conveniently, right around that time several of the goats appeared on season 4 of Game of Thrones in one scene, a dragon breathes fire over a small herd and snatches one up into the air. More than $115,000 was raised – enough to pay off the banks and keep the farm going in the short term.Thorvaldsdóttir now has 250 goats on her farm, far more than anyone else in the country, and the nationwide population has grown to 1,200. Still, the breed’s survival is not guaranteed.When she first tried to sell goat meat, people gave her funny looks. “Is it even edible?” they would ask. But public opinion is changing quickly more restaurants are serving goat, and more Icelanders and tourists are acquiring a taste for it.“When saving a breed, you have to use it,” says Thorvaldsdóttir. “If they aren’t giving you income, no one will work with them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b2e95b7279e1bde31134e2eca5870ced54ac42b/0_253_3340_2003/master/3340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7855e169a415598048cf33a8c27b1891","title":"jamal khashoggi was worried about consulate visit says fiancee","story":"Hatice Cengiz says she has been in ‘darkness I cannot express’ since journalist entered Saudi consulate The fiancee of the killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi has said he was worried about visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul for his fateful appointment, but told her he did not think the authorities would dare to interrogate or arrest him in a foreign country.“His local network in Turkey was very good as you know, his political network as well,” Hatice Cengiz told the Turkish broadcaster Habertürk in an interview on Friday. “He thought Turkey is a safe country and if he would be held or interrogated, this issue would be swiftly solved.”The Washington Post columnist, who left Saudi Arabia for the US last year after growing fearful for his safety in his home country, was killed shortly after arriving on 2 October to pick up paperwork needed for the couple’s upcoming marriage.Cengiz, who waited outside until about 1am on the day Khashoggi disappeared, said he had been treated well during an initial visit to the consulate the previous week.Riyadh’s varied and changing explanations for what happened to the writer have been met with international outrage, sparking the biggest diplomatic crisis for the kingdom since the 911 terrorist attacks and throwing an unwelcome spotlight on the powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Cengiz, a Turkish academic who became engaged to Khashoggi four months ago, said she has “found myself in a darkness I cannot express,” since her fiance was killed. She had asked US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who recently called her about the case, whether he had any news that would make her happy “but he said he didn’t”.She has not received a condolence call from Saudi officials, Cengiz added.Istanbul police said Cengiz had been placed under 24-hour police protection this week, without elaborating on the reasons why.Riyadh said for the first time on Thursday that the evidence in the criminal investigation pointed to a “premeditated” killing of the dissident journalist.Previously, Saudi authorities had said that Khashoggi died during a fight with Saudi officials carrying out a rogue extradition operation, and that his body was rolled up in a rug and disposed of by an unidentified third party. His remains have still not been found. Turkish investigators, however,have alleged that Khashoggi was tortured before his death and his body dismembered with a bone saw by a 15-man hit team sent to kill him.Confidence in the prince’s judgment and temperament has been seriously shaken by the murder, which observers say could only have been carried out with his knowledge. Even his staunchest allies in the west have struggled to give him political cover. Those who had overlooked a regressive political landscape because of social and economic reforms and downgraded ties between the state and religious establishment may no longer be prepared to do so. Investors have fled, his celebrity pull has plummeted and even his reliability as a big picture partner of the Trump administration’s goals in the region is in question. Prince Mohammed was seen as central to the US’s anti-Iran stance, and a regional outreach to Israel. Both bedrock policies could now flounder.

As she contends with the threat of Russia and crises in Syria and Yemen, her message is clearThe lights are being switched off on the world’s stage. The United Nations security council has heard the latest horrific news from Yemen and is shutting up for the evening as the sunset reflects pink off New York’s East River. Karen Pierce, the UK’s ambassador, who fights the country’s diplomatic battles in the cockpit of the council, has just stepped away from the chamber’s famous C-shaped negotiating table and has a gap between the Yemen session and a dinner event on nuclear disarmament. Pierce tells an aide she will go to the dinner, but will not be eating. “I will, however, need a stiff drink.”While the political class back home is consumed with Brexit and finds itself derided and increasingly ignored in Europe, Britain still wields the clout of a major power at the UN. The privileges the UK acquired when it emerged as a victor of the second world war – permanent membership of the security council and the veto power that comes with it – cannot be taken away without Britain and the four other permanent members – China, France, Russia and the US – voting for it.It is Pierce’s job to wield that clout. She is the first woman to do so, a reflection of the glacial pace of change at the Foreign Office, where women have only recently been given a shot at the plum ambassadorial posts. Diplomats and observers agree she has been a robust presence since starting the job in March. Her style is resolutely direct and informal. At a climactic security council session, she wore a leather jacket and a red-and-black boa. While many British diplomats have become more taciturn as the Brexit saga has worsened and the treasured “special relationship” has become hostage to Donald Trump’s antics, Pierce has remained garrulous and relaxed around journalists.Unusually for a permanent representative, as ambassadors to the UN are called, she often addresses the security council without notes and has engaged in pointed ad lib exchanges with her Russian opposite number, Vassily Nebenzia, over Syria and the nerve agent attack on the Skripals in Salisbury. In a surreal encounter in April, the two diplomats traded barbed cultural references. Nebenzia scorned the idea that the Russians would do anything as blatant as using novichok poison in broad daylight in an English city. Anyone who watched Midsomer Murders could do better, the Russian envoy sneered. Pierce struck back with Sherlock Holmes. Allowing the Russians to take part in the Skripal investigation, she said, would be like “Scotland Yard inviting in Professor Moriarty”. Nebenzia – whose mirthless grin and shiny, bald pate would make him a passable Blofeld in any UN-themed Bond remake – countered by reading a passage from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland in which the queen demands “sentence first – verdict afterward”. Pierce quickly retorted that her Russian colleague might be better served by the quote: “Sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”Speaking in a small, plain room in the UN headquarters, Pierce says: “There’s a little bit of theatre in it. It’s partly about showing the Russians we can’t be pushed around. It’s good to be able to be seen to stand up to them in public in the security council and show them that the arguments don’t go their own way and that there’s a pushback on the stories and lies that they try to tell.”It is diplomacy almost as a contact sport. A week after the literary skirmish, the Russians suffered an embarrassing defeat, mustering only two other votes – from China and Bolivia – in the 15-member security council for a resolution condemning US air strikes to punish the Syrian regime for using chemical weapons. Pierce called over one of Nebenzia’s deputies, Vladimir Safronkov, a burly man who towered over her, and gleefully held up three fingers to his lapel. “Three again. You only got three,” Pierce taunted. “Just like Kosovo.” Pierce was rubbing salt in the wound. Almost 20 years ago, Safronkov was involved in a Russian effort to stop the Nato intervention in Kosovo, one that mustered the same paltry tally of votes. “It just helps the Russians to be reminded of where the bulk of UN opinion is,” Pierce says. “It’s quite an interesting indicator of where the true centre ground lies.”She adds that Safronkov took her three-fingered challenge in good humour and that she maintains a polite working relationship with her nemesis on the council, Nebenzia. “On the whole, at the moment, most of the council members get on reasonably well personally and that helps,” Pierce says. There is no point in bearing grudges, as the next day there could be a debate on another crisis where “we might want to have unity on the council so that we can help make something positive happen”.The positives have been hard to come by at the security council, the job of which is to confront the worst that humanity has to offer. It hears daily reports of barbarity in Syria or the man-made famine in Yemen. In April, the permanent representatives went to Myanmar and visited the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where they were plunged into a scene of human misery. “I had one girl throw herself on me. All her family, her parents and uncles and aunts, had been killed in front of her,” Pierce says. They met young boys who had been crippled by mines and were too traumatised to remember what had happened to them.She had been sceptical of the practice of security-council excursions, suspecting they were no more than diplomatic tourism, but the brutal realities of the atrocities perpetrated on the Rohingya changed her mind. “The scale was just unimaginable,” she says. At least one of the ambassadors broke down in tears. When they went to visit Aung San Suu Kyi, “she didn’t seem to comprehend the scale of what needed to be done to put this right. Accountability seemed to be something that could be dealt with in a very leisurely fashion to her,” Pierce says. Her ministers blamed the refugees for their predicament, saying they had failed to fill in their repatriation forms correctly. Pierce had met Aung San Suu Kyi years before in Switzerland and had been struck by her calm charisma. This time, she says ruefully: “I think everyone was just bitterly disappointed.”The founders of the UN envisaged the security council as a keeper of global peace, but it is an ideal that has rarely been lived up to. In almost every mass killing of recent decades, one or more of the permanent council members has been friend and protector of the killers. In Myanmar, it is China in Syria, it is Russia. In Yemen, the US, France and the UK are serving as quartermasters for the coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, whose relentless aerial bombardment has caused most of civilian deaths. The UK continues to sell arms to Riyadh through one outrage after another, including the bombing of a bus that killed 40 boys going on a school trip. For all the uproar over the cold-blooded murder of the dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, there are no signs that the UK will suspend sales of arms and military hardware, which were worth more than £1.1bn in 2017.“The Saudis buy their weapons from a range of countries,” Pierce says. “They would simply buy more from Russia and China if the west did not supply them with arms. But, in any event, the UK has a very strict code of conduct when it comes to arms sales to Saudi Arabia certain criteria must be met.” Ministers have to certify that Saudi Arabia is trying sufficiently hard not to kill innocent people, she adds.UK ministers, as with those in the Trump administration, have found ways to continue certifying weapons sales to Saudi Arabia in the absence of evidence that the civilian death toll from the bombing is coming down. Saudi Arabian investigators find their armed forces blameless in the overwhelming majority of cases. Britain’s role in Yemen has been condemned in parliament and by human rights groups, but the official line goes largely unchallenged at the UN, where Russia and China are reluctant to put human rights high up the agenda.The security council has remained fairly united on Yemen by focusing on humanitarian aid issues and pushing for UN-brokered negotiations. Pierce makes the distinction between Syria – which she describes as “a great power question” between Russia and the US – where the security council is ided and paralysed, and Yemen, which Pierce says is “a test case for the UN”, as its role as a potential peacebroker is acknowledged by the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran.In the breadth and global importance of the issues covered, and the daily necessity to negotiate alliances and do diplomatic battle with adversaries, there is no job in British diplomacy like permanent representative to the UN. Pierce has served as special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, ambassador to the UN and other international organisations in Geneva and director general for political affairs at the FCO. But this job, she says, with all its raw geopolitics, is the summit. It is a role she has been preparing for for a long time. She grew up in Preston in Lancashire, “reading boy’s books and drawing fighter jets in art class”. Her northern accent was stripped away at a young age by elocution lessons. “My mother says that’s because I stammered when I was a little girl,” Pierce says, although she sounds sceptical of the explanation. In those days, having a strong regional accent was not seen as the way to get on in life.Pierce identifies the decisive moment in her early life as sitting at the breakfast table aged about 11 and staring at a photograph of an African American diplomat boarding a battleship in some sunny, foreign place. That woman was almost certainly Eleanor Hicks, an extraordinarily charismatic figure and one of the very few African American women who served in senior roles abroad for the US state department in the early 70s. Hicks was the US representative in Nice and her wit, beauty and fashion sense made her a sensation in colour magazines around the world.“I definitely remember being attracted by the blue of the sky, the white of her suit and her black skin, the grey and the whites of the sailors,” Pierce says. “It was a stunning photograph. I didn’t understand where it was, but it wasn’t Preston.”Now that Pierce has broken through all the glass ceilings of the FCO to reach the UK seat on the security council, there is a danger that she has arrived at the moment the country she represents is about to plummet in its global influence. After Brexit – the economic consequences of which could be disastrous – Britain will not be able to claim to be a bridge between the US and the EU. France will be the sole representative of the EU on the security council and therefore take the lead in most collective action the EU attempts in the council and in the UN as a whole.Pierce argues that European countries will continue to support each other at the UN on the basis of common values, rather than EU membership. “As we leave the EU, the UN will be an even bigger stage for the UK to be an active, independent force – hopefully a force for good,” she says. She can see the UK fighting to preserve a rule-based international order in the face of assaults from Russia and its allies. “I think, without blowing our own trumpet too much, most people here would think that was a good role for the UK.”And what if Brexit triggers Scottish independence and the implosion of the UK, which would presumably put its privileged seat on the security council under threat? “We’re not planning on that,” Pierce says briskly. “We’re not thinking that will happen.” Brexit has not come yet and the kingdom remains united, for now. Britain still has its little suite of rooms tucked away in the eaves of the security council and most denizens of the UN headquarters agree that Pierce has brought some much-needed confidence and flair to arguing Britain’s corner in the world’s biggest arena.Meanwhile, the sun has gone down on the East River, but Pierce still has another two events to attend before that stiff drink."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a36a638c9b68c2c0f14ef3bbb6559671a9160e09/0_2_2059_1235/master/2059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a36fc03f5967391a3cac6d9a49233b5","title":"russia brexit liam fox wto plan uk","story":"UK must now open talks with countries that opposed proposals or face trade disputesRussia is among 20 countries that are looking to squeeze a commercial advantage from Brexit after blocking an attempt by the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, to fast-track a World Trade Organization deal on the UK’s terms of trade with the world.Whitehall is now facing “up to two dozen” different negotiations with countries over how much meat and dairy produce will be permitted into the British market and what tariffs the UK will set on imports.The development will pile pressure on the UK’s already strained resources. The Department for International Trade spent more than £1m on recruitment consultants alone in its first year trying to take on experienced trade negotiators, an area that had previously been left entirely to the EU.The UK is a full member of the WTO, but as an EU member state it currently shares a set of so-called schedules with the other 27 countries that make up the bloc. Fox, a passionate believer in Brexit, had sought to rush through a set of the UK’s independent schedules on the tariffs and quotas that would be imposed on goods from the world’s major agricultural exporters.The plan had been for the UK and EU, as independent WTO members, to ide the current quotas between the two according to the historical flows of trade in each product, in what was described as a “technical rectification”.A large number of countries opposed the plan, however, claiming that they would lose out from the arrangement. The UK will now have to open talks with all those who have opposed the proposals or face trade disputes that could stymie future bilateral trade deals.David Henig, UK director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, said: “This is ‘Brexit meets reality’, more than a huge problem. It is not a terrific surprise that this has happened. We expected almost all the big agricultural economies – the US, New Zealand – to do this. But in terms of the bilateral free trade deals that we hope to get with Australia, New Zealand and the US, these could be delayed while we haggle over the numbers.“It’s a complicated discussion and it could easily take a couple of years to sort out and that means it would be three or four years before we could implement bilaterals, so it is likely to introduce delays.”Despite the setback, the UK will be able to trade on the provisional set of schedules it has tabled while it negotiates with those who withheld support. The tabling of the disputed schedules will also allow the UK government to liberalise their tariffs and quotes on some products to allow non-EU importers to compete with European importers to the benefit of British consumers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The UK lodged a 719-page draft of the terms of post-Brexit trade with the WTO earlier this summer, with formal “reservations” raised during a three-month consultation period that has just ended.Fox told the Commons in a written statement on Thursday: “As expected, some trading partners have expressed reservations about our proposed treatment of tariff rate quotas.”The Department for International Trade said: “The large majority of our trading partners do not have any objections to our proposed goods schedule. A small number have submitted their concerns and would like to discuss further.“This was expected and does not impact our ability to trade independently. The terms we have set out will form the basis of our trade policy while we engage with our WTO partners to address their concerns.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eac9a4a041ad2fb34c42abdfce6b137c7703e7b8/0_0_3071_1844/master/3071.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68037dc761c1d841e020e7ce5aceaac1","title":"swedish military tight lipped over submarine spotted near capital","story":"Swedish MPs were not informed of alleged sighting of submarine by teenagers near Stockholm in JuneSwedish politicians are seeking answers after reports emerged of the sighting of a submarine in Stockholm waters in June, which the military did not tell parliament’s defence committee about.Newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported late on Thursday that three teenage instructors and children at a sailing camp in the suburb of Lidingö had spotted the mystery vessel on 28 June. For about 20 minutes, they observed what they believed to be a dark grey or black submarine near the surface and watched it sail away from where they were sailing dinghies.The teenagers took photographs and a short video of the object, which Dagens Nyheter published on its website.The Swedish military learned of the incident several days later by word of mouth, and sent two officers to question the teenagers, aged 17 and 18, on 4 July.“We are confident about the measures we took when we received this information. But I can’t go into which measures were taken nor which conclusions were drawn,” said armed forces spokesman Jesper Tengroth.“The military does not share Dagens Nyheter’s view that this was a foreign submarine,” Tengroth later told the newspaper. But he refused to say whether the military had identified the object, and if so, what it was.Dagens Nyheter said neither the Swedish military nor civilian submarines were active in the area at the time of the sighting.“We are of course going to make sure we get this information as soon as possible. Observations like this should be taken seriously,” conservative Moderate party MP Beatrice Ask told news agency TT.Tengroth said the military would inform Swedish lawmakers “relatively soon”.Reports of sightings of submarines are not uncommon in Sweden. In October 2014, Sweden launched a massive hunt for a foreign submarine, suspected to be Russian, in the Stockholm archipelago over an eight-day period. The military subsequently confirmed that “a mini submarine” had violated its territorial waters, but was never able to establish the vessel’s nationality.After years of massive military cutbacks in the post-cold war period, Sweden has in recent years raised its defence spending, much of it focused on upgrading its capacity to detect and intercept submarines.A non-Nato country, Sweden has also stepped up its military capabilities and exercises with the alliance, including the current Trident Juncture 18 exercises, amid signs of more assertive Russian behaviour in the Baltic region."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/582d1a56d515bc250aead29ca770c1e57a96c2a2/0_32_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dda6b8e6452fc1dac59b8d0d6e5d62e4","title":"ireland to remove of blasphemy and to re elect president exit polls show","story":"Referendum follows vote to overturn abortion ban, as Michael Higgins set for second termIreland has voted to remove the crime of blasphemy from its constitution by a significant majority, according to exit polls.Official counting of the votes beings on Saturday. The blasphemy referendum was held alongside a presidential election, which exit polling suggested had been been won by a landslide by the incumbent, Michael D Higgins.Should the referendum figures be confirmed once the votes are counted, the move would be the latest sign of the weakening of religious conservatism in the country.The last prosecution for blasphemy in Ireland was in 1855, but three years ago Irish police investigated comments made by Stephen Fry on television in which the comedian described God as “capricious”, “mean-minded”, and an “utter maniac”. The investigation was later dropped after police decided insufficient numbers of people had been outraged. The  poll, conducted by IpsosMRBI, questioned more than 4,300 voters outside 160 polling stations across the country. It produced broadly similar projections.Opinion polls throughout the campaign consistently placed Higgins as the favourite, despite being plagued by questions over presidential expenses.If re-elected, the 77-year old will become the fifth Irish president to serve for two terms.

I will function as the prime minister. I will remain as the prime minister,” he said.Constitutional lawyers, political activists and pundits debated on social media and Sri Lankan TV into early Saturday whether Wickremesinghe’s ouster was legitimate. The constitution says the president, Maithripala Sirisena, has the right to appoint someone he thinks has a majority in parliament.But the 19th amendment, added in 2015, says a prime minister can only be removed when he or she ceases to be a member of parliament such as for failing to meet criteria to be an elector or candidate, when a vote of no-confidence is passed, or when he or she chooses to resign.Speaking to jubilant supporters outside his Colombo home, Rajapakse called on Wickremesinghe to step down.Members of Wickremesinghe’s party must “respect democracy, respect the country and respect the law”, the ex-president said through a loudhailer from a balcony.Rajapakse loyalists stormed two state-owned television networks overnight - which they regard as loyal to the outgoing government - and forced them off the air.Video footage from private networks showed police overwhelmed by mobs at the Rupavahini national TV station but elsewhere in the capital streets remained calm. The United States called on all sides in Sri Lanka to operate within the constitution and refrain from violence.“At the moment, there is a constitutional crisis – two persons each claiming to be the prime minister,” said Jehan Perera, executive director of the nonpartisan National Peace Council of Sri Lanka.“What the president now should do immediately is to summon Parliament and have a vote. That’s the democratic way to resolve this crisis,” Perera said.Rajapaksa ruled Sri Lanka as president for nine years beginning in 2005, accumulating immense power and popularity among the country’s majority ethnic Sinhalese after overseeing the military’s brutal defeat of ethnic Tamil rebels in 2009, ending a 25-year civil war. Some supporters hailed him as a king and saviour.But he also was criticised for failing to allow an investigation into allegations of war crimes by the military. Under his government, dozens of journalists were killed, abducted and tortured and some fled the country fearing for their lives. He lost a bid for re-election in 2015 amid mounting allegations of corruption and nepotism.His return to power as prime minister could signal that Sri Lanka is sliding back to an era of violence against political opponents, critics and journalists, observers said.Members of Wickremesinghe’s government called Friday’s move a coup.“The appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister is unconstitutional and illegal. This is an undemocratic coup,” Mangala Samaraweera, finance minister of the outgoing government, said on Facebook. The dramatic developments came after deepening disagreements between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe over economic policy and day-to-day administration of the government.Sirisena is also believed to have been behind a failed attempt to impeach Wickremesinghe in April."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoUntil Peter Casey did his Donald Trump, I wasn\u0026rsquot so interested, but I couldn\u0026rsquot rest after that\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash Annie McDonaghEoghan Murphy accused of \u0026lsquopolitical manipulation\u0026rsquo as families taken off monthly listTransport Infrastructure Ireland highlights limited ability of M50, N3, N4, N11 and N81Move may complicate Government plans to introduce terminations from JanuaryNTA accused of \u0026lsquojumping the gun\u0026rsquo by pre-empting the results of a consultation processExit polls have proved reliable guide in previous elections and referendumsPeter Casey, in distant second, polls weakly among youngest category of 18-24-year-olds exit poll projects blasphemy referendum will be passed comfortablyScheme could see staff receiving higher payMinister for Health says he got some good news about boy\u0026rsquos case from the Department of JusticeComedian reveals elderly gentlemen bring flowers to studio to ask Mrs Brown outEngineering solutions mean many students will be able to return to their schoolsVaradkar on visit to Derry says Brexit creates \u0026lsquoan enormous challenge\u0026rsquoLack of effective environmental regulation in the North may impact on the South17 gangs now operating within the prison, Governor saysDr Gabriel Scally to review outsourcing of work by testing laboratories overseas\u0026lsquoI probably lost my temper a bit\u0026rsquo: Victim rejects apology after man denies being racist"},{"url":null,"title":"irish is spoken in house of commons for first time in more than 100 years","story":"  October 24, 2018Plaid Cymru MP is one of only a few MPs to use Irish in the House of Commons   October 25, 2018, 1901: \u0026lsquoAn angry yell of indignant astonishment arose from the Irish benches\u0026rsquo "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3677097.1540570975!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"national road system may not be able to cope with busconnects plans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe M50: The Transport Infrastructure Ireland’s submission noted the inclusion of an orbital bus route  on the M50, ‘where the motorway is frequently congested and where the speed limit of 100kph applies’. Photograph: Alan Betson  The The national road system may not be able to cope with some of the key changes proposed in the BusConnects project aimed at improving Dublin’s bus service.In its submission to the National Transport Authority (NTA), Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has highlighted limited ability on the roads to accommodate the proposals. It pointed to a number of national roads which are proposed to be used for spinal and orbital bus routes, namely the M50, N3, N4, N11 and N81. “Within the metropolitan Dublin area on the radial routes outside the M50, due to increasing demand and congestion, there is often restricted scope to increase capacity within the existing national road corridors whilst protecting their existing strategic function and also meeting future projected demand,” its submission said. “This means there may be limited ability within the existing national road corridors to accommodate public transport proposals such as interchanges, bus lanes, etc.” Under the BusConnects plans, current bus numbers would be replaced by a new lettering system from A to G, indicating seven main routes through the city, with buses running every four to eight minutes on these “core corridors”.Radial bus routes would be supplemented by frequent orbital services, enabling passengers to switch from one bus to another at no extra charge. The plan acknowledges some bus users who currently have a direct route into the city centre from where they live would have to change buses to reach their destination but says journey times will be significantly shorter.TII’s submission noted the inclusion of an orbital bus route (W4) on the M50, “where the motorway is frequently congested and where the speed limit of 100kph applies”. “This may have implications for bus service reliability,” it said. TII is responsible for the country’s national roads and light rail infrastructure. The NTA said it agreed with TII, that on national roads “there may be some limitations within them to accommodate additional public transport facilities”. “NTA and TII are working together to identify and exploit all opportunities to add additional bus facilities,” an NTA spokeswoman said.“At the moment TII is developing proposals to widen the N3, which is the road the Blanchardstown core bus corridor will travel on, and the NTA is collaborating with TII to provide additional bus lanes as part of that proposal.”TII said both agencies acknowledged that due to existing traffic levels on the M50 and its orbital routes, there were “limited opportunities for changes to the existing infrastructure”.“Each corridor has unique characteristics and will require specific solutions that both organisations will work together in providing,” a spokesman said. A revised network is due to be published by the NTA by mid-2019 and a further round of public consultation will begin. The new network is expected to be rolled out by early 2020. Aside from a redesign of the network, the BusConnects project also involves upgrading 16 core bus routes and cycle lanes into the city. Property owners who may lose part of their front gardens will be notified from next month and a separate public consultation process will run until the middle of 2019.The NTA previously said the network redesign could be implemented using the current road network with “some upgrades to infrastructure at key interchange locations”. “These can be done in advance of the rest of the bus lanes and cycle lanes being built,” it said. TII’s submission also noted “a considerable number of instances” where the proposed network plan would interact and interchange with Dublin’s Luas system. “These interfaces need to be complementary and supportive of the functions and operations of both public transport systems,” it said.

Her mother lived with a constant threat of her children being taken from her. “That was what people said about us on the television at the time . . . we still only make the bad news, we all get tarred with the same brush. “My father worked for farmers, I picked spuds, and there were places where we were welcome and plenty where we were not,” Mrs McDonagh said.She was determined that her children would have the education she missed out on, though she has fluent Traveller “cant”, and has lived in local authority housing for over 40 years.“There are no saints on either side, but we have to talk to each other, not get set against each other,” Mrs McDonagh said. “What would I do if I met Peter Casey? I’d ignore him, only because I don’t what to bring myself down to his level. Most of my family work, and three of my children married into settled families.”Mr Casey’s negative comments during the presidential campaign had “ignited the Travelling community”, her friend Anne Ward from Galway’s west side said.She is a neighbour of President Michael D Higgins, living in an estate built to replace the Rahoon flats down the hill from his Circular Road home. “Michael D was often in having tea with many of us, and so was his wife, Sabina,” Ms Ward said. “He knows about our high suicide rate – 11 times that of the settled community, particularly among young men – and he has been to our funerals and to our cultural events.”As a councillor and a Labour Party TD for Galway West, Mr Higgins had worked to counter the negative image which Galway earned half a century ago when violent exchanges over attempts to accommodate Travellers defined the term “Rahoonery”.“The Galway Traveller Movement asked people to vote, but didn’t single out any candidate,” its deputy co-ordinator, Bridget Kelly, said. Mr Higgins knew her grandparents, and helped to house her parents when one of her sisters was born with a disability. “We know that four of the other five candidates did speak up for us,” Ms Kelly said. “We just want a president who will represent everyone fairly and challenge all racism and discrimination.”All three women were determined to cast ballots, but said it was hard to motivate their children after the tone of debate over the past fortnight. “Maybe Mr Casey doesn’t know what it is like to hide who you really are,” a young Traveller man from the east side who preferred not to give his name said. He is in continuing education, having left school early to get his first job at the age of 15.“Our vote doesn’t make any difference in general elections, but it will when we have local elections next year. It’s so sad to think that we are the only community in Ireland that has to pretend we are someone else,” he said. “We have had an Olympic boxer, Francie Barrett, from this city, and people forget that,” Mrs McDonagh said. “We took a bus up to the Dáil when taoiseach Enda Kenny announced our ethnicity and we were in the gallery and all so proud. To think that was only March of last year.”Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3677339.1540586841!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish times exit poll michael d higgins on course for decisive first count victory as peter casey surges into second place","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins  arriving to vote on Friday at St Mary’s Hospital in the Phoenix Park. Photograph: CollinsMichael D Higgins is set to be easily re-elected President of Ireland when the votes are counted on Saturday, according an Ipsos MRBI exit poll for The , despite a strong showing for the Independent candidate Peter Casey.The poll projects that Mr Higgins will win 56 per cent of the vote, comfortable enough to win the election on the first count.But turnout was expected to be low, reflecting a lack of public enthusiasm for the contest that was evident throughout the campaign.The poll was conducted among 4,365 respondents outside 160 polling stations across the country on Friday, and its accuracy is estimated at +-1.5 per cent.Mr Casey, whose campaign was marked by criticisms of Travellers and their separate ethnic status, surged ahead of all the other challengers to finish with 21 per cent of the vote, the poll predicts.Opinion polls in the early part of the campaign estimated negligible support for Mr Casey. However, after his criticisms of Travellers, and his assertion that there was a growing culture of welfare dependency in Ireland, support appears to have surged towards Mr Casey in the final weeks of the campaign, with pollsters at some polling stations reporting that he was attracting as many voters as Mr Higgins.The other candidates all finished in single figures having made little significant impression on voters.Seán Gallagher, who won half a million votes in 2011, failed to make any headway according to the poll which predicts he will finish with just 7 per cent of the vote - some 22 percentage points less than his 2011 share of the vote, when he won 29 per cent.But the biggest disappointment was probably for Sinn Féin, whose candidate Liadh Ní Riada won just 8 per cent of the vote, the poll predicts. This is a level far below Sinn Féin’s support at the last general election, and just a third of the party’s current support in the most recent Ipsos MRBI Opinion poll.Pieta House founder and Senator Joan Freeman won just 6 per cent of the vote, the poll predicts. Independent candidate Gavin Duffy flopped completely, ending a miserable campaign with just 2 per cent of the vote, the exit poll finds.The expected result comes after a scrappy campaign that saw no candidate emerge unscathed. While Mr Higgins was never moved from his perch as hot favourite throughout, he shipped considerable criticism over his use of the Government jet, expensive hotel accommodation on overseas visits and the lack of transparency over how an annual €300,000 allowance for his office was spent.While Mr Higgins was often put on the defensive, especially during the debates he attended, none of the other candidates were able to turn Higgins’s discomfort into support for them, and the incumbent retained a huge lead throughout the campaign.The breakout from the pack of challengers only came late in the campaign with Mr Casey’s criticisms of Travellers and aspects of Ireland social welfare system.The referendum to delete the reference to blasphemy in the Constitution was, as expected, overwhelmingly passed, with the exit poll predicting that 69 per cent of voters have backed the proposal, while 31 per cent have voted to retain the blasphemy provision.Younger voters overwhelmingly backed deletion, while older voters were much more evenly split, with 48 per cent voting to retain the constitutional article as it currently stands.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3677331.1540595625!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord s week i hear you re a bigamist now kevin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister of State Kevin “Boxer” Moran, who as groom “Butty” Moran is getting “married” in a charity fundraiserThe Government may be in serious jeopardy this weekend when a Minister of State from the midlands is revealed as a bigamist.Kevin “Boxer” Moran, already married to the lovely Michelle, is due to marry Precious Clarke at a lavish ceremony in Abbeyshrule on Saturday night. A large number of guests will attend the wedding in The Rustic Inn, after which there will be dinner, speeches and buck-leppin’ into the early hours.We tracked down the Minister to his prenuptial hideaway on Friday and discovered that the wedding booklet had already been printed, flowers were on order and he had changed his name to “Butty” Moran to throw the authorities off the scent.“I met her on the road after her car broke down. She told me there was water in the carburettor. She wasn’t wrong, she’d driven the car into the river Inny. I gave her a tow, and it went from there. You could say I pulled twice in the one evening,” said the shameless Minister for the OPW and Flood Relief.“She’s a lovely girl. I’m so excited me knees are wobbling,” he told us, revealing that Precious is also married, and her adoring husband, Tom Clarke, calls her Kath. “It’s actually her wedding anniversary on our wedding night, but we don’t care. It was mine last week.”The wedding bouquet, along with Butty’s buttonhole, is fashioned from brown envelopes. “I hear the bride’s rigout is lovely,” he told us. Precious will be a fully veiled vision in white lace. The groom and his groomsmen will be wearing black suits, but they will be wearing red ties while his tie is pink.The theme of their happy event is Much “I Do” About Nothing.Minister Moran admits his wife Michelle “only found out a couple of days ago” about his second wedding. “She said she was surprised because she didn’t think anyone else would have me. She’ll be going on the night to make sure Precious takes me off her hands.”He says hundreds of tickets have been sold for the event. When it’s all over, the wedding planners will be sending a big ball of money to help with the running of Ballymahone daycare centre for the elderly.We were sad to hear the news of the death of former Fine Gael TD Seymour Crawford. The “gentle giant” from Aghabog in Co Monaghan was universally liked around the House and nobody ever had a bad word to say against him.Having served as a county councillor, he was elected to the Dáil in 1992 and held his seat until he retired from politics at the 2011 election. A former vice-president of the Irish Farmers’ Association, the ruddy-faced politician was a devout Presbyterian and an all-round good egg.His death last Saturday reminded us of a staff party in the Oireachtas dining room many years ago when, for reasons we have long forgotten, a number of Fine Gael members arrived in fancy dress. Highlight of the night was the unexpected sight of the stolid Seymour bursting through the doors dressed in a full Lycra Batman costume, including the grey tights. And by his side, a youthful Simon Coveney dressed as Robin.At this week’s plenary session of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly in London, delegates remembered deputy Crawford as a diligent member of the assembly, which works to build understanding and co-operation between political representatives in Britain and Ireland.Senator Paul Coghlan, a longtime assembly member, recalled driving his Fine Gael colleague to a meeting in Scotland as he had injured his back on the farm and was unable to fly. The Killarney-based Senator drove up to Monaghan, collected Seymour and the pair of them got the ferry from Larne to Stranraer.On the journey, Coghlan, a clubbable inidual, was looking forward to the post-meeting convivialities. Crawford was busy studying maps and guides. On Saturday night, as the MPs and TDs and Senators enjoyed drinks and a sing-song, Crawford approached Coghlan, a Catholic, and informed him he had found a solution “for the following morning”, which would suit both of them.“We’re going to split the difference. I’ve found an Episcopalian church. Nine o’clock service.”Coghlan put down his gin and tonic and retired to bed.Bumped into a Fianna Fáil TD on Friday.“Did you see Podge and Rodge? What did you think?”Right enough, we had heard the two aul’ fellas from Ballydung Manor returned to our TV screens this week. The reviews weren’t great.“Eh, no. Didn’t see it.”“No, not the puppets. Young Dev and Mark Daly. What do you think?”It’s hard to know what to think, but it isn’t every morning you turn on the radio to hear Audrey Carville twice asking a Fianna Fáil Senator: “Did you and Éamon Ó Cuív go rogue last night?”Senator Mark Daly waffled but didn’t deny it.When Politicians Go Rogue: there could be a TV series in this.Daly and Ó Cuív travelled to an event in Omagh and “unveiled” the first Fianna Fáil candidate to stand for election in the North. The pair of rogues presided at a meeting to announce the candidacy of former Sinn Féin member Sorcha McAnespy, both men assisting in the big reveal by tantalisingly slipping off a Ballydung beige blanket from an FF election poster featuring the former Sinn Féin councillor.Only problem is, Fianna Fáil was kept in the dark. “The Unveiling of Sorcha” could have been an oil painting in the National Gallery for all they knew about it.Announcing the party’s first candidate in Northern Ireland for the best part of a century is a big event. It would merit the presence of the party leader. A far bigger hall. And a courtesy call to the SDLP.Could it be that Galway Rodge and Kerry Podge were deliberately trying to provoke and unsettle the leadership? Some say that the pair would like nothing better than a general election and a Fianna Fáil return to power in coalition with Sinn Féin. Ó Cuív wouldn’t be averse to such an arrangement, and neither would Daly, who relied on Sinn Féin votes to get into the Seanad on a couple of occasions.Party headquarters is fuming. No candidate has been selected. Daly and Ó Cuív don’t seem to care. But their announcement has been shot down, for now. Put the drapes back on.It’s a case of premature congratulations for Fianna Fáil’s Podge and Rodge.Speaking of nights out, did the Taoiseach look a little tired when he went to the Tyrrelstown Educate Together school in Dublin on Thursday morning for his photo-op to demonstrate his Government’s concern over the closure of a number of schools due to building safety concerns?We only ask because he had a rare night off on Wednesday. Leo began his evening in the Royal College of Physicians, where he looked very happy and very proud to see his partner, Dr Matthew Barrett, graduate from a medical training programme as a specialist cardiologist.They are the epitome of a power couple.The Taoiseach then made his way from Kildare Street to Merrion Row for an end-of-session get-together with his Fine Gael colleagues. The Dáil rose for a midterm break on Thursday and reconvenes on Tuesday, November 6th.A number of Ministers, including Richard Bruton, Simon Harris and Eoghan Murphy joined him in Foley’s upstairs bar for drinks and nibbles – fish and chips were served in cardboard cones. Despite the fact they had to buy their own drink, there was good turnout from TDs and Senators.But there was a noticeable absence of female politicians. For most of the night, Minister of State for Europe Helen McEntee was the only woman at the party.It’s been a big week for RTÉ’s David McCullagh. On Tuesday night he had the unenviable task of herding six presidential candidates around a lengthy TV debate while stifling the urge to yell “For the love of God, why won’t yis all just f-f-flip off and leave us alone!”Because that was the viewers’ prerogative.Dr Dave – he’s a historian as well as an anchor on Prime Time – did an excellent job on the night. But he couldn’t rest on his laurels because the launch of his latest book was the following evening.Former taoiseach Brian Cowen did the honours for De Valera: Rule (1932-1975) at a reception in Hodges Figgis bookshop, telling the crowd that one of Dev’s finest achievements was to retain the loyalty of his ministers. “You can take it from me, that’s a magnificent achievement,” said the Biff, who wasn’t so fortunate in that regard.The book is the second and final volume of the broadcaster’s biography of The Long Fellow, taking up the story in 1932, when De Valera’s first Fianna Fáil government comes to power. Cowen praised the author for his objective portrayal of “a crucial character in Irish politics” and for providing “a wonderful, detailed and accurate account of de Valera’s time in government and out of it”, he said.He quoted the book’s closing line: “For better or worse, Éamon de Valera did more than any other inidual to shape the Ireland over which he ruled and, for better or worse, that Ireland, like its creator, now belongs to history.”What would Dev think of Brexit? He was vocally anti-European integration throughout his career. He never ulged what way he voted on Ireland joining the European Economic Community, but shortly before we formally entered, he told family members: “I am the first and last president of an independent Ireland.”As president he used to attend lectures on advanced mathematics in the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies. After one particularly difficult episode, he told the director, JL Synge, he wouldn’t be returning. Synge admitted he couldn’t think of a suitable reply, as he hadn’t understood a word of it either.McCullagh also discovered that Dev was something of a romantic. When Edward VIII was considering abdication so he could marry Wallis Simpson, the taoiseach was the only one of the Dominion prime ministers who thought he should be allowed stay on. When the British official discussing it with him expressed surprise, Dev said that while orce wasn’t allowed in Catholic countries, it was in Protestant countries, and he thought that many people would “in these democratic days, be attracted by the idea of a young king, ready to give up all for love”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3677252.1540581147!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach confident but not complacent hard border can be avoided","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar (left) with General Secretary of the Apprentice Boys of Derry William Moore during a visit to the association’s Memorial Hall in Londonderry.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he is “confident but not complacent” that there will not be a hard border in Ireland.Speaking to reporters in Derry, Mr Varadkar said that Brexit created “an enormous challenge”, but he was confident a hard border would be avoided.“The reason we don’t have a hard border either between Northern Ireland and Ireland or between Britain and Ireland is because of the European Union, because of the fact that we have the same rules and regulations,” said Mr Varadkar.“That is the crux of it. By maintaining full alignment, by continuing to have the same rules and regulations, we can avoid a hard border.“I don’t want a hard border between the North and South any more than I want one between the island of Ireland and Britain,” he said.“What could give rise to a hard border is a hard Brexit, or a hard Brexit that doesn’t make special arrangements for Northern Ireland, so I can absolutely assure you that I’ve spent a lot of my time since I became Taoiseach trying to avoid both of those things, and that’s what we’re working towards.”During his visit Mr Varadkar toured the museum of the Apprentice Boys of Derry, an institution similar to the Orange Order.He also visited the Ráth Mór centre in the Creggan area of the city, where he spoke to groups involved with Creggan Enterprises as well as representatives from local schools and victims and survivors of the Troubles.The Taoiseach said that the continuing lack of an Assembly in the North meant that Northern Ireland’s voice wasn’t being heard the way it should be during the Brexit negotiations.Northern Ireland has been without an administration since it collapsed in January 2017 amid a row over a botched renewable energy scheme.“I think people in Northern Ireland are losing out because we don’t have a functioning Executive and Assembly,” said Mr Varadkar.He said there were important decisions to be made around healthcare and major infrastructure projects, and that North-South bodies were being prevented from operating as they should.“Co-operation round health, infrastructure and tourism is still happening, but not at the level we would like,” said Mr Varadkar.“In many ways the voice of Northern Ireland isn’t being heard the way it should be during the Brexit negotiations.Mr Varadkar said both he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tánaiste Simon Coveney, would be working hard over the next few weeks to try and get an agreement over the nature of the UK’s departure from the EU.“I think if we have some certainty about the next few years when it comes to Brexit, and of course certainty that there won’t be a hard border between north and south, I think we may then be in a good position to get those talks going again,” he said.During his visit, the Taoiseach said he had discussed how to bring “more economic opportunity, more understanding and more development” to Derry.“Our vision is to have Derry and Letterkenny work together and try to develop a city region that will be of benefit to both sides of the Border,” he said.Mr Varadkar said a key part of this was the upgrade of the main A5 Derry to Dublin road.“I’m frustrated that hasn’t started yet, I was very involved in it when I was minister for transport, and I’d love to see that up and running again.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The account has liked more than 100 conservative pages, including several anti-Clinton and pro-Trump groups.On Friday night it emerged that Sayoc had threatened to blow up his local electricity company, telling a representative “it would be worse than September 11th” if they ever turned off his electricity.A representative from Florida Power and Light told the Miami police in August 2002 that Sayoc “threatened to blow up” the FP\u0026ampL building, and threatened the representative.Cesar Altieri Sayoc, who was arrested during an investigation into a series of parcel bombs, is escorted from an FBI facility in MiramarHe was sentenced to one year probation.Sayoc also used social media to make threats, attacking Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg and sending American Football player Colin Kaepernick a picture of a beheaded goat, saying “see you real soon.”Sayoc was born in Brooklyn, New York, and went to high school in North Carolina.He graduated from Brevard College in North Carolina in 1984, according to his LinkedIn profile. The college declined to confirm whether he had attended the school, but Sayoc was on the Brevard College soccer team in 1981 and pictured as part of a Catholic organisation at the school, according to school documents posted online.His LinkedIn profile described him as a veterinary student at High Point University in North Carolina. The school\u0027s registrar\u0027s office confirmed that Sayoc had applied, but said he was not currently enrolled.The building in Florida that has reportedly been identified as the home of the mother of Cesar SayocSayoc worked as a stripper in the 1990s and was obsessed with bodybuilding, wrestling and steroids, family members said.One cousin told NBC News he was a “loose cannon” and a “lost soul” who didn’t speak to his family and had a problem with steroids.“He’s been in the strip clubs since he was 22, that was his life,” the cousin said. “He was a male dancer and he wanted to be a wrestler. He was taking steroids. He was all buffed up. He was built like a rock.”Tony Valentine, an event promoter in Ohio, said Sayoc was a “big muscle head” who “wanted to be a professional wrestler — that was his dream.”“He really couldn’t find his niche in life, and I guess he found it now,” Valentine told the Washington Examiner. “Back in the nineties, he was running around from Minnesota to the Carolinas to Florida.

philippine holiday island boracay reopens strict new","story":"The Philippines re-opens its crown jewel resort island Boracay to holidaymakersTourists landed by the boatload Friday on the Philippines\u0027 Boracay island, which re-opened with a slew of new rules after a six-month shutdown aimed at undoing the impact of years of unrestrained mass tourism.Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine president, shuttered the tiny white-sand island in April, declaring it a cesspool where businesses flushed raw sewage into the once pristine turquoise waters and trash soiled in beaches.Among the first to land after the government threw open the doors just past dawn were first-timers attracted by the prospect of a spruced up, less crowded island.Once a quiet hideaway favoured by backpackers, the tiny island was transformed by overdevelopment into a mass destination seeing some two million visitors per year.Under the new regime, the beachfront is cleared of the masseuses, vendors, bonfires and even the builders of its famous photo-op sandcastles that once crowded it.All water sports save for swimming are also banned for the time being, while Boracay\u0027s three casinos have been permanently shut down in line with Mr Duterte\u0027s wishes.The island was closed as it was unable to sustain the volume of visitorsBuildings were bulldozed and businesses pushed back to create a 30-metre (98-foot) buffer zone from the waterline.Away from the water the sound of machinery and hammering echoed in the air as resorts made improvements to meet new requirements and crews toiled away on a widened main road.Boracay, which major travel magazines consistently rate as among the world\u0027s best beaches, measures a mere 1,000 hectares (2,470 acres).Yet it was seeing up to 40,000 sun worshippers at peak times, with tourists spending $1 billion (£780,455) a year but also leaving mountains of garbage and overwhelming the sewage system.The new rules say 19,200 tourists will be allowed on the island at any one time, with the government aiming to enforce that by controlling the number of available hotel rooms.Scores of hotels and restaurants were ordered to close because they did not meet standards, while just under 160 tourism-related businesses have been approved to re-open.The six-month clean up was aimed at repairing the damage inflicted by years of unrestrained mass tourismDrinking and smoking are banned and the huge multi-day beach parties dubbed LaBoracay that drew tens of thousands of tourists during the May 1 Labour Day weekend will be a thing of the past.The Boracay Foundation, the main business industry group on the island, said the sector supports the new regulations aimed at cleaning up the resort.The rules and ordinances are really perfect... it\u0027s just a matter of implementation, its executive director Pia Miraflores told AFP.For a long time we\u0027ve been asking for the political will to implement the rules and regulations, she added.Tens of thousands of workers were left unemployed when the island\u0027s tourism machine was deprived of visitors. They cheered as the guests began to arrive.Duchess of Sussex cheers USA compatriots at Invictus event - as Beckham joins royal couple at GamesWreck found near North Pole recalls courageous exploits of Florence Nightingale\u0026#39s cousinThousands of Scottish teachers to march in pay protestComment: Ignore our colleagues\u0026#39 beauty parades, Chancellor, and deliver a truly Conservative budgetTonga cleared rainforest of mosquitoes ahead of Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s visit to ease Zika fearsUS mail bomb suspect named as Cesar Sayoc, Trump supporter with long criminal historyHousing benefit bill set to treble to £70 billion by 2050, report warnsCesar Sayoc: The mail bomb suspect who drove a van plastered with Trump stickersPhilip Hammond to slash business rates for half a million small retailersCouples could marry in back gardens for first time under shake up of 180-year old marriage rules Comment: Scottish Government\u0026#39s targets mean more goats will be shot by farmers or an American huntressAdverts for the Government\u0026#39s smart meter roll out banned from claiming the devices are \u0026#39free\u0026#39Fracking stops as Lancashire tremors rip through safety limitsWomen\u0026#39s champion Baroness Brady drawn into Sir Philip Green #MeToo scandalExclusive: Philip Hammond preparing to bring forward income tax cuts in Budget boost for BrexitCelebrities and friends of Sir Philip Green silent over #MeToo scandalMigrant\u0026#39s son challenges Angela Merkel from left field as Greens poised for upset in Germany\u0026#39s financial capitalPeople\u0026#39s Vote campaign accused of flouting Facebook\u0026#39s new advertising rulesMPs and peers to be investigated over historical abuse as Bercow\u0026#39s future hangs in the balanceKarren Brady: The businesswoman with a reputation for critiquing sexism in the workplaceSir Philip Green allegations could see him stripped of knighthood, says former member of Whitehall committeeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000178928287_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqKxMay4KI7w5ufZARtkg_PTchjSKmh4zoUrzJAdkSovU.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"met philip green sneering boisterous show says fashion editor","story":"British billionaire and CEO of the Arcadia Group Green attending the opening ceremony of a Topshop flagship store in Hong KongCourt of AppealInterviewing Philip Green isn’t something that comes up that often. “This is rare,” he gruffed, waving his hand at me and my dictaphone when I was dispatched to talk to him about the launch of Ivy Park, his joint venture with Beyonce. We were in his boardroom.

The crowd yelled: CNN sucks.Cesar Altieri Sayoc, who was arrested during an investigation into a series of parcel bombs, is escorted from an FBI facility in MiramarDetails, meanwhile, continued to emerge about Sayoc. Sixteen years ago, Sayoc had threatened to blow up his local electricity company, telling a representative “it would be worse than September 11th” if they ever turned off his electricity.A representative from Florida Power and Light told the Miami police in August 2002 that Sayoc “threatened to blow up” the FP\u0026ampL building, and threatened the representative.He was sentenced to one year probation.Sayoc also used social media to make threats, attacking Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg and sending American Football player Colin Kaepernick a picture of a beheaded goat, saying “see you real soon.”Mr Sayoc, of Aventura, Florida was arrested at an auto parts store in the nearby city of Plantation, around 30 miles north of Miami.He is a registered Republican with social media accounts containing messages supporting Mr Trump and promoting conspiracy theories about George Soros, the billionaire political donor who was the first targeted this week by a package bomb.He appeared to be to living in his van, showering on the beach or at a local fitness centre.Cesar Sayoc\u0026#39s van is seen in Boca Raton, Florida, U.S., October 18, 2018 in this picture obtained from social mediaMr Sayoc\u0027s white van, which was seized by authorities, was plastered in images of Mr Trump, along with a CNN SUCKS sign and a photo of Hillary Clinton with a target superimposed on her face. Mr Trump said he had not seen pictures of his face on Mr Sayoc\u0027s van, saying: “I heard he was a person who prefers me over others, but I did not see that”. He also suggested on Twitter that the threats had hurt the Republicans in the polls.Court records show Mr Sayoc, who was born in New York, has an extensive record of past arrests, including a stint served on probation for making a bomb threat. Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, said Mr Sayoc had been charged with five crimes, including the illegal mailing of explosives. A conviction on the charges could result in up to 48 years in prison, he said. Mr Sessions said he did not comment on the suspect\u0027s motive but said he appears to be a partisan.Images of Cesar Sayoc at a Trump rally in 2016 have emergedChristopher Wray, the FBI Director, said Mr Sayoc\u0027s finger print was found on one of the devices addressed to Congresswoman Maxine Waters. There was also a possible DNA link with Mr Sayoc and two of the packages, he said.Mr Wray said there may be more packages that have not yet been discovered, as he warned these are not hoax devices.Authorities were still uncovering new potential explosive devices on Friday, as it emerged two packages addressed to a Democrat senator and prominent donor were found in California.The AutoZone at 801 S. State Road 7 is seen where Cesar Sayoc, a 56-year-old man from Aventura, Florida was arrestedThe nationwide manhunt began earlier this week after a series of explosive devices addressed to leading Democrats including former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden and Mrs Clinton were discovered.The cable news network CNN and prominent critics of Mr Trump including the actor Robert De Niro were also targeted.At the White House, Mr Trump said: These terrorising acts are despicable and have no place in our country.We must never allow political violence to take root in America.He called for Americans to unify, saying we are united together in love and peace as fellow citizens.However, he went on to hit out at the level of negative coverage he receives in the media, saying: I get attacked all the time. Come to think of it, who gets attacked more than me?I can do the greatest thing for our country, and on the networks and on different things it will show bad. I won\u0027t use examples because today is sort of a special day because we caught somebody. As he spoke, chants of CNN sucks and fake news could be heard from the audience, who were attending a Young Black leadership event.The spree of attempted attacks began on Monday, when a device was delivered to the home of Mr Soros. On Tuesday a suspicious package was discovered addressed to the Clintons\u0027 house in Chappaqua, New York. On Wednesday a similar device addressed to the home of the Obamas was intercepted in Washington, DC. A package addressed to John Brennan, the former CIA director, was later found in the mail room of CNN\u0027s New York newsroom. FBI Agents walk on along the balcony of a condo in the building that has a possible connection to alleged bomber Cesar Sayoc and his mother The offices of Democratic congresswomen Deborah Wasserman Schultz in Florida and Maxine Walters in California, along with Eric Holder, the former attorney general were also targeted. The packages had Ms Wasserman Schultz’s office named as a return address on the envelope, suggesting the would-be bomber had particular animosity towards the congresswoman.On Thursday two packages addressed to Mr Biden, Mr Obama\u0027s Vice President, were intercepted at mail facilities in Delaware. Another was found at De Niro\u0027s upmarket Manhattan restaurant.On Friday, a device addressed to Democrat senator Cory Booker, a potential future presidential candidate, was found at a mail facility in Southern Florida, where many of the packages are reported to have originated.Shortly afterwards a device bearing the name of James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence, and addressed to CNN\u0027s newsroom was found at a Manhattan postal centre. Mr Clapper occasionally contributes to the cable news network.Officials said all 13 IEDs were largely similar in design and construction, according to the FBI. Each consisted of around six inches of PVC pipe, a small clock, a battery, wiring, and energetic material. Some of the packages also included photographs of the targets marked with a red X.All the packages were similar in appearance, delivered in manila envelopes with printed addresses and several stamps.On Friday night authorities were investigating two more suspicious packages in California - one addressed to Democrat senator Kamala Harris and another addressed to billionaire Tom Steyer, who has called for Mr Trump\u0027s impeachment.Mr Clapper called the attacks domestic terrorism and blamed Mr Trump for the coarseness and incivility of the dialogue in this country.Mr Trump also drew criticism for tweeting earlier on Friday: Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this “Bomb” stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics.

Job cuts would probably affect Asda’s petrol, bakery, back office and “hosting” operations, as well as roles in its clothing arm, George, according to Press Association. In a statement, the company said: “In a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them\u0026nbspand, inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do, or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores.Asda cuts price of petrol by 2p a litreAsda customers steal shopping baskets to avoid paying for bags What removal of Asda price guarantee scheme will mean for shoppers“We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers.“We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren’t easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them.”The GMB union said Asda’s decision to announce potential job cuts just two months before Christmas was a bad one. Gary Carter, the union’s national officer,\u0026nbspsaid: “These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run up to Christmas, is doubly appalling.”He added: “Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company. “These cuts make no sense whatsoever – slashing our members’ jobs would hurt the service ASDA customers receive. GMB will fight tooth and nail for every single job.“With all the speculation surrounding the proposed Sainsbury’s merger and potential sell offs of stores – this news will not put anyone’s mind at rest.”Asda and Sainsbury’s announced plans for a £10bn tie-up in April\u0026nbspand the deal is being scrutinised by the competition watchdog.Last month, Asda announced it was scrapping its price guarantee scheme, which gave customers money off if the cost of their shop was not 10 per cent cheaper than if bought at a rival chain. The company said at the time: “It’s a decision we’ve not taken lightly because we love it dearly, but in reality, we know our customers don’t love it enough for us to keep it.“Instead they want us to focus our investment on lowering our prices, and they’ll let us know if we’re falling out of step with the competition.”In July, the supermarket said it was entering into consultation with colleagues at its Enfield Home Shopping Centre in London, putting 261 jobs at risk.

Within a few years, it would be worth more than $10 billion and would eventually peak above $300 billion – surpassing the market cap of the payments giant Visa.Yet despite this success, bitcoin and the thousands of cryptocurrencies that have since appeared are still largely a fringe technology, unable to truly break into the mainstream.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearWhile bitcoin has taken off and is seen as the leader of the cryptocurrency market, it’s been adopted by the few not the many, said Chakib Bouda, chief technology officer at US-based payments firm Rambus.Confusion amongst users has played a part, but arguably the biggest failings for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past years lies with security, in the first six months of 2018 alone over $761 million bitcoin was stolen, with experts predicting that the amount stolen from exchanges will top $1.5 billion by the end of the year.The key to overcoming this issues, Bouda\u0026nbspsuggested, is keeping the private keys needed to access and use cryptocurrency funds both secure and easy-to-use.\u0026nbsp One way of doing this would be adopting technology used within the traditional financial sector to bring cryptocurrencies up to the levels of security and usability that people expect of a modern currency.Once this secure ecosystem is in place, it’s going to transform how many sceptics view bitcoin transactions, Bouda said. So whilst cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been described as the ‘Wild West’ by the UK treasury, we expect that in 10 years’ time, bitcoin will become mainstream and have a remarkably different reputation.If bitcoin is able to transform its reputation in this way, bitcoin could find its way into everyone\u0027s pockets through mobile wallets –achieving\u0026nbspmainstream adoption\u0026nbspin time for bitcoin\u0027s next\u0026nbspbirthday.It\u0027s a view shared by Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of the online trading platform eToro. The next decade could see bitcoin being accepted as the norm when it comes to money transfer and payments, he said. As with any startup idea, early days are always risky, but I feel these are now few and far between.Alternatively, if another cryptocurrency is able to become a safe and\u0026nbspconvenient payment method\u0026nbspbefore bitcoin developers implement the necessary technology, bitcoin\u0027s place as the world\u0027s most popular cryptocurrency could be usurped.This is the view of Nigel Green, founder and CEO of the deVere\u0026nbspGroup, a financial consultancy firm based in London. Mr Green suggested that bitcoin\u0027s influence will drastically reduce in the cryptocurrency sector, however the overall crypto market will expand by at least 5,000 per cent.“Bitcoin is what kickstarted the crypto revolution and it has changed the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets, amongst other things, forever.\u0026nbsp It all began with bitcoin, Mr Green said.\u0026nbsp“However, whilst I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that\u0026nbspbitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade.\u0026nbspThis is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organisations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for bitcoin and dent its market share.He continued: “In addition, it is likely that bitcoin will be hit by the superior technology, features, and problem-solutions, offered by existing and yet-to-be-released cryptocurrencies.”If the deVere\u0026nbspCEO\u0027s forecast is correct, the boost from\u0026nbspmajor institutional and retail investors will see the cryptocurrency market rocket towards\u0026nbspthe $20 trillion mark by 2028.Financial institutions and regulators, amongst others, understand that cryptocurrencies are the future of money, he concluded.\u0026nbsp“As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Firms including BP, Rio Tinto and Volkswagen, are facing calls to reconsider their ties to lobbying organisations whose climate change policies do not match up to the targets set out by the Paris Agreement. Investors have written to 55 companies in total, asking them to “review the lobbying positions being adopted by the organisations of which you are a member”, particularly any groups which might oppose progressive climate change policies. Some of the other businesses that have been approached include Unilever, Nestle and Rolls-Royce. The 55 firms have been chosen due to their high greenhouse gas emissions and “significant role in energy intensive sectors”, investors said, and the decision to take action on “back-door” lobbying comes weeks after the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe.He may have accepted it but Trump will do nothing about climate changeClimate change to cause global beer shortage, research showsBanks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEGovernment urged to act fast on climate change after UN warningUnder current climate commitments by world leaders, the Earth will be 3C warmer by the end of the century, according to the IPCC’s report. However, the worst effects of global warming - including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities - will only be avoided if the global temperature increase stays below 1.5C, a figure the scientists think will be exceeded within around 20 years. Adam Matthews, director of ethics \u0026amp engagement, Church of England Pensions Board, said: “Misleading and misaligned corporate lobbying practices undermine the ability of governments to act on climate change and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The influence of trade associations is often exerted behind closed doors and can be deeply insidious to public policy making on climate change. “As the recent report from the IPCC clearly highlighted, the stakes are high and time is against us. It is therefore right that investors are challenging Europe’s most high-emitting companies to ensure consistency in their lobbying practices.”Stephanie Pfeiffer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said: “Long-term investors have a clear interest in the Paris Agreement being implemented to support the necessary transition to a low-carbon global economy. Shareholders should rightly expect companies in which they invest to advocate for the climate policy required for this to happen. This includes ensuring the trade bodies of which they are members are working to the same end.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He was born in the Kerala region of southern India and his parents roamed the country working for the government as part of the rubber board. Then his father decided to go into the private sector, setting up as a producer of adhesives. “My dad wasn’t the best entrepreneur,” Janardana says. His father had no difficulty obtaining a line, or lines,\u0026nbspof credit – but not from entirely reputable sources. He was being charged 10 per cent per week i.e. a higher rate of interest than Wonga\u0026nbspused to levy. Labelling his father’s lenders\u0026nbsploan sharks is unfair to sharks. “Debt collection is not exactly regulated in India,” says Janardana the younger. “People were lining up outside the house screaming at us to give them their money back.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt was the son who paid them all off in the end. He studied engineering, worked in telecoms, rolling out the network in India, then went to business school, was hired by Capital One, and started in its credit card office in Washington DC. Fortunately the exchange rate of dollars to rupees was favourable at the time. Junior, then aged 24, salvaged the family finances. In April 2008, I was labelled a party\u0026nbsppooper. People said ‘it’s only a Wall Street\u0026nbspcrisis. It’s a US thing. We’re not in the\u0026nbspsubprime\u0026nbspmortgage business’“It’s more about reputation – face and respect – in India,” he says. “Sometimes your parents’ social security is you. To be fair, they wouldn’t have incurred so much debt if not for me. I was living off them for a long while.” In the wake of that traumatic experience, and while working for Capital One, lending to consumers, and having responsibility for collections and defaults, Janardana could feel defaulters’ pain. He was abnormally sensitive to any looming crisis. The year 2007 found him based in London. “We were all gung-ho for growth,” he says. But Janardana pointed out even when the economy was doing well, losses were piling up, and he forecast rocky times ahead.“In April 2008, I was labelled a party pooper. People said ‘it’s only a Wall Street crisis. It’s a US thing. We’re not in the subprime mortgage business’.” But Janardana’s warning was heeded and by September 2008, when everything unravelled, Capital One\u0026nbsphad a head start of three or four months, and had already shut down new custom\u0026nbspand reduced exposure. Still, “it wasn’t a fun time. Most of 2008 was spent just trying to survive.” By that\u0026nbsptime,\u0026nbspJanardana had decided not to return to the US, and to become a British citizen. Zopa attracted him because it was something completely different: a\u0026nbsp“peer-to-peer” system\u0026nbspin which investors and borrowers are brought together for mutual advantage, with Zopa in the middle, like the shaded area of a Venn diagram. One person’s loan is another’s investment. Investors do better than they would by parking money in a bank – albeit with higher risk – and borrowers get a much better deal than Janardana’s entrepreneurial father ever did. The typical borrowers are teachers and nurses in their mid-30s, often for the purpose of home improvements or buying a car. The average loan size is just under £10,000. With his engineering background, the thing that particularly pleased Janardana was how Zopa had managed to speed up the process of obtaining a loan. The business does its own risk assessment. But what really concentrated minds, was the question of comparison sites. Zopa had previously informed applicants if they could get a loan in 27 seconds flat. But Money Supermarket said approval had to be 12 seconds for it to show up on its site – Zopa got it down to seven. The exact rate is outlined within three minutes. “The real rate,” stresses Janardana, “not the ‘lowest rate’ – which is so misleading.” Janardana has been CEO since August 2015. “We’ve had a charmed four years,” he says. The business\u0026nbsphad a turnover of £265m in 2014-15, now it’s more than £1bn. Revenue has gone up from £11m to £45m. Customer satisfaction, according to Trust Pilot, hits 4.8 or 4.9 out of 5. Now Zopa is two years into building a fully-fledged online bank, and is running the registration gauntlet, performing the required stress tests. It\u0026nbspwants to “extend the ethos of peer-to-peer into retail banking”.The average amount people borrow from ZopaWe are sitting in the Zopa HQ on the south bank of the Thames, looking out at the river flowing languidly by, with the towers of the City leaning over it. It’s probably something to do with his personal history, and his mum and dad nearly going under, but when Janardana speaks of “giving customers more control”, it’s easy to feel the passion and conviction beyond the expression of good intentions. He objects to what he calls “the winlose model”. He ought to get a job as chancellor of the exchequer. In fact, he comes out with a line neither the chancellor – nor anyone else, other than Jeff Bezos\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspgets a chance to say very often. “We had too much money”. In other words, there was more lending than borrowing. Citizens Advice\u0026nbspknows\u0026nbspcustomers who renew loans generally get a worse rate than those who switch. Banks make money by upping the rate. “We could have pulled the same trick, but we don’t want to do that,” says Janardana, sounding a bit like Chris Tarrant on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. “With us you always get the same rate as a new customer. A bank where we win, and our customers win.” Even if he is CEO, Janardana still talks regularly to the guy who handles “complaints”. He wants people to be happy and sometimes Janardana speaks more like a yoga teacher than a money expert. It’s rather zen and soothing. “I want,” he says, “to take away the points of tension.”A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In a statement, the company said: “In a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them\u0026nbspand, inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do, or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores.Asda cuts price of petrol by 2p a litreAsda customers steal shopping baskets to avoid paying for bags What removal of Asda price guarantee scheme will mean for shoppers“We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers.“We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren’t easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them.”The GMB union said Asda’s decision to announce potential job cuts just two months before Christmas was a bad one. Gary Carter, the union’s national officer,\u0026nbspsaid: “These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run up to Christmas, is doubly appalling.”He added: “Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company. “These cuts make no sense whatsoever – slashing our members’ jobs would hurt the service ASDA customers receive. GMB will fight tooth and nail for every single job.“With all the speculation surrounding the proposed Sainsbury’s merger and potential sell offs of stores – this news will not put anyone’s mind at rest.”Asda and Sainsbury’s announced plans for a £10bn tie-up in April\u0026nbspand the deal is being scrutinised by the competition watchdog.Last month, Asda announced it was scrapping its price guarantee scheme, which gave customers money off if the cost of their shop was not 10 per cent cheaper than if bought at a rival chain. The company said at the time: “It’s a decision we’ve not taken lightly because we love it dearly, but in reality, we know our customers don’t love it enough for us to keep it.“Instead they want us to focus our investment on lowering our prices, and they’ll let us know if we’re falling out of step with the competition.”In July, the supermarket said it was entering into consultation with colleagues at its Enfield Home Shopping Centre in London, putting 261 jobs at risk.

Firms including BP, Rio Tinto and Volkswagen, are facing calls to reconsider their ties to lobbying organisations whose climate change policies do not match up to the targets set out by the Paris Agreement. Investors have written to 55 companies in total, asking them to “review the lobbying positions being adopted by the organisations of which you are a member”, particularly any groups which might oppose progressive climate change policies. Some of the other businesses that have been approached include Unilever, Nestle and Rolls-Royce. The 55 firms have been chosen due to their high greenhouse gas emissions and “significant role in energy intensive sectors”, investors said, and the decision to take action on “back-door” lobbying comes weeks after the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe.He may have accepted it but Trump will do nothing about climate changeClimate change to cause global beer shortage, research showsBanks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEGovernment urged to act fast on climate change after UN warningUnder current climate commitments by world leaders, the Earth will be 3C warmer by the end of the century, according to the IPCC’s report. However, the worst effects of global warming - including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities - will only be avoided if the global temperature increase stays below 1.5C, a figure the scientists think will be exceeded within around 20 years. Adam Matthews, director of ethics \u0026amp engagement, Church of England Pensions Board, said: “Misleading and misaligned corporate lobbying practices undermine the ability of governments to act on climate change and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The influence of trade associations is often exerted behind closed doors and can be deeply insidious to public policy making on climate change. “As the recent report from the IPCC clearly highlighted, the stakes are high and time is against us. It is therefore right that investors are challenging Europe’s most high-emitting companies to ensure consistency in their lobbying practices.”Stephanie Pfeiffer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said: “Long-term investors have a clear interest in the Paris Agreement being implemented to support the necessary transition to a low-carbon global economy. Shareholders should rightly expect companies in which they invest to advocate for the climate policy required for this to happen. This includes ensuring the trade bodies of which they are members are working to the same end.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Lady Green owns all of the shares in their company, Taveta, which is registered in Jersey and controls Arcadia.\u0026nbspSir Philip has claimed he chose to live in the principality\u0026nbspbecause of a “heart scare” he had twenty years ago.Lady Green has pointed out other benefits to tax havens: “My understanding is that jurisdictions such as Jersey and the British Virgin Islands are commonly preferred for their strong regulatory regimes,” she wrote to MPs\u0026nbspin 2016.The Arcadia Group is the clothing empire that made Sir Philip’s reputation as a retail king and remains the source of much of his wealth. It boasts some of the biggest names on the high street: Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Evans, Burton and - the jewel in the crown - Topshop, which has successfully expanded into the US in recent years.But the rapid upward trajectory has recently reversed with the Arcadia’s value being slashed by half in just a year. Topshop’s revenues dropped 5.6 per cent last year, in spite of a jump in online sales.Topshop lost £10.9m in the year to August 2017, compared with a £59.4m profit in the previous 12 months. It also has a worrying pension deficit of up to £1bn - not the first time one of Sir Philip’s companies have experienced problems in that regard.The tycoon bought BHS for £200m in 2000 and took it back into private ownership. He rebranded it as British Home Stores and brought it under his Arcadia umbrella before ridding himself of it in 2015, by which time it had racked up £1.3bn in debt including a large pension deficit.\u0026nbspUntil the recent sexual harassment allegations it was Sir Philip’s conduct during and after the disposal of BHS that had most tarnished reputation.Pensions committee chair Sir Frank Field summed it up succinctly earlier this year: “Sir Philip Green stripped BHS bare and then left it for dead, with contemptuous disregard for the pensioners.”\u0026nbspPhilip Green\u0027s case is proof that we need to get rid of NDAs for good£500,000 in 28 seconds is the fastest money Philip Green has ever lostPhilip Green named in parliament as businessman who gagged mediaSurrounding himself with \u0027yes\u0027 men was Philip Green’s undoingAre Sir Philip Green and Frank Field up for a rematch? Let\u0027s just seeThe businessman sold BHS for £1 to a company controlled by a Dominic Chappell, a man who had been declared bankrupt three times and had no retail experience.\u0026nbspThe chain collapsed into administration a year later, with 11,000 jobs lost and a £571m deficit in the pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe Pensions Regulator found that the “main purpose” of the transaction was so that Sir Philip could avoid liability for the fund which contained 22,000 people’s retirement savings.Sir Philip came under heavy and sustained fire from the regulator and MPs, before eventually making a voluntary payment of £363m to help make up the deficit.\u0026nbspMPs recommend former BHS owner Sir Philip Green is stripped of knighthoodSir Philip owns three luxurious yachts including the 295ft Lionheart which he bought for £100m at about the same time as he took collection of a £46m Gulfstream private jet and offloaded BHS.He was believed to be holidaying on the Lionheart in the Mediterranean when he stated in September 2016 that he was “working every day” to save the stricken retailer’s pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe previous month he was filmed\u0026nbspon the Greek Island of Ithaca attacking a reporter who tried to question him about BHS’ demise. “That’s going in the f***** sea,” Sir Philip shouted while pointing towards the reporter’s camera equipment.The Pensions Regulator said at the time that the vessel could be seized in order to generate cash to pay into the BHS fund. In the end he kept both the yacht and his knighthood, though there will now be renewed calls for him to be stripped of the latter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Alphabet’s stock fell 4.7 per cent after it posted revenue of $33.74bn, missing Wall Street’s target of $34.04bn, although earnings of $13.06 per share came in well ahead of the expected $10.42 per share.

However, Christopher Rossbach, CIO of investment firm J.

The fundamentals of both companies are intact and we believe that any significant weakness is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.”Other tech stocks that dipped in after-hours include Apple, which fell 1.6 per cent, and Twitter, which was down 2.5 per cent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s not a particularly special sofa: it’s navy blue, from John Lewis, and lumpy from years of people wedging their arses into the cracks between the cushions. If you sit on the chaise longue too hard, it flips like a seesaw.For three and a half years, this sofa was a sort of talisman representing everything that I loved about my old life: home, comfort and belonging.I’ve just moved back to London from Hong Kong, that rocky, typhoon-drenched island off the coast of southern China. It’s nice to be home. I’ve gone from being Theresa May’s “citizen of the world as\u0026nbspa citizen of nowhere” to being a somewhere person again.And what a strange time to be back. The irony that I moved home desperate to belong somewhere again at precisely the same time that the UK is figuring out where and how it belongs itself, is not lost on me.I left the UK at the start of 2015 with my now husband. He’d transferred with his company (HSBC – it seemed obvious we’d end up in Asia), and I’d jacked in my lovely job as an editor on a travel magazine. We’d been living in London for years since graduating and just wanted a change of scene. Friends had started to inch down the aisle and I couldn’t bear many more winters of X Factor. My East Asia experience was limited: I’d been to Shanghai in 2011 to meet a friend and had come back with an unshakeable sense that Asia was where things were moving forward, rather than stalling in Europe.Hong Kong seemed a good choice. It was exotically far-flung, but at only (only!) 6,000 miles away it was close enough to be home in 15 hours and as a former British colony, it had a reassuring vein of home running through it (crucially, the plugs were the same). Plus, as a travel editor, the prospects for fun weekends away in cities like Tokyo, Bangkok and Beijing was intoxicating. Hong Kong was hot, humid, hedonistic and so fast-paced I figured I’d have to sprint to keep up.\u0026nbspThe problem? I’m a somewhere person. I never knew how much I relied on my emotional connection to my home city to inform much of my character until I left it.Hong Kong –\u0026nbspswaggering, sweaty, bombastic Hong Kong –\u0026nbspis an anywhere kind of place. The friends I made came from erse backgrounds and nations, with friends, ties and cultural touchpoints all over the world. By contrast, I came from a world of single culture: most of my family lives within two hours of each other (except one rogue uncle who lives in Malawi) and my close friends are the ones I’ve had since school. I first went on a plane at the embarrassingly old age of 15 (I don’t think anybody, least of all my Eurocamp-loving parents, thought I would end up flying a lot for work).Expat\u0026nbsplife was like being back at university, but with a lot more cashThe first year in Hong Kong was tough as I clung to my Britishness, my London-ness, like a comfort blanket. In my 350 square foot, two-bed flat in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, I felt not so much fresh off the boat but flung sharply off it. The sights and smells of my new neighbourhood were almost literally intoxicating, and I couldn’t understand why the supermarket opened, begrudgingly, at 8.10am. I never knew where I was going, and I lost all the swagger I had in London about knowing the coolest, newest places to go. I missed my default lazy Sunday afternoon walking along the South Bank, popping into Tate Modern –\u0026nbspin Hong Kong, there didn’t seem to be any museum really worth a repeat visit. (This is a well-known problem –\u0026nbspfor a global city, Hong Kong doesn’t have any world-class institutions, although the recent opening of the Tai Kwun arts complex and the upcoming opening of the M+ visual arts centre is changing that.)In the UK, I fitted in. I knew this retrospectively because I’d never even considered that I hadn’t. It was a natural sort of belonging. My life revolved around the reassuring timestamps of ordinary British life: Strictly Come Dancing,\u0026nbspthe weird April heatwave\u0026nbspand the John Lewis Christmas ad. I still counted down to Christmas based on that the release of that ad.Eighteen months after we moved, Brexit happened.I can still remember the exact moment I found out that the UK had voted to leave the European Union. It was mid-morning in my glassy office block, and colleagues and I had stayed up watching the count. Hong Kong felt very far away from it all, and to be honest Brexit gave us an excuse for a boozy lunch in some drab Belgian-themed pub and the opportunity to use the suffix “exit”\u0026nbspto describe the leaving do of a friend moving away from\u0026nbspthe city.Created with Sketch.In pictures: The coffin homes of Hong Kong Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A general view of residential and commercial buildings in Yau Tsim Mong District which is a popular location for the \u0027subided units\u0027 in Hong KongA five year-old boy plays outside his tiny home, which is made of concrete and corrugated metal on the rooftop of an apartment block as he lives with his parents in an illegal rooftop dwellingA resident walks outside his illegal rooftop dwelling, which is located next to a public housing estate, in the backgroundLi Suet-wen and her son, 6, and daughter, 8, live in a 120-square foot room crammed with a bunk bed, small couch, fridge, washing machine and small table in Hong Kong.

In wealthy Hong Kong, there\u0027s a dark side to a housing boom, with hundreds of thousands of people forced to live in partitioned shoebox apartments, \u0027coffin homes\u0027 and other inadequate housingMy friends and family back home were at the coal face of it. My parents were sending me angry face emojis and announced they were moving to France (two years on they’re still in Essex – their plans to move are about as far along as Theresa May’s). Other friends who’d been up all night sent me bleary-eyed emojis and lightly indignant Whatsapp messages –\u0026nbspwasn’t I glad I lived all those miles away?At that point, the 6,000 mile chasm did feel just that: thousands of miles away. In Hong Kong, a very different type of politics talk was on the agenda for dinner-party conversation –\u0026nbspwould Hong Kong keep its independence or be squashed by China? –\u0026nbspand I sort of hoped Brexit might have collapsed under the weight of expectation by March 2019 anyway.Although in the year after it happened, I was glad to live away from the machinations and non-decisions and dreary refrains of “Brexit means Brexit”. Besides, as sterling fell through the floor, I’d managed to cream off more pounds for my Hong Kong dollars that ever before. I even tentatively posited that if the UK did leave the EU, I might as well set up home in Hong Kong instead.Theresa May’s 2017 speech, in which she derided the anywhere people who felt at home across the world, put into words the crude, untrue split between Leavers or Remainers. It was a defining moment for Brexit, and it was a defining moment for me. At the time, I was an “anywhere”\u0026nbspand couldn’t understand how people like me had become anathema to the national feeling. Most worrying was realising that the UK I ached for was not the UK I would find myself in if I moved back.And how I wanted to move back.\u0026nbspAround the time that May made her “citizen of nowhere” speech, I started to grudgingly accept that I must rather like living in Hong Kong –\u0026nbspafter all, I’d been there for two years. It was probably something to do with the lifestyle, which was hard not to love. Champagne brunches in the winter all-you-can-drink junk boat outings in the summer. Life was just easier: the subway always ran on time and you never woke up to a cold floor in the mornings, even in winter. I made true friends that put up with my constant existential whining about Hong Kong (if you’re reading: I’ll always be truly grateful).Plus, there were the opportunities. Expat life was like being back at university (when was the last time you heard a journalist compare Nottingham with Hong Kong?) but with a lot more cash. The people you met for drinks could introduce you to their entire network, and I met an average of six new people a week (in my six years in London, I think I met six new people in total). Somebody you knew was always doing something entrepreneurial –\u0026nbspthanks to the city being one of the most open places to do business in. Everybody knew everybody, which was comforting, until it started to feel suffocating. I couldn’t escape my job, even though I adored it.Eventually I came to realise that champagne brunches and low tax rates and the indifference I had for Hong Kong weren’t the things I wanted from my life or at least not one full enough for me to accept. The fact I lived 12 flying hours away from family and my closest friends, who were getting married and sprogging with alarming briskness, weighed on me heavily. I had planned my own wedding long-distance and it felt like it was happening to somebody else during much of our 18-month engagement.\u0026nbspIn Hong Kong, I always felt hollow at the fact that I didn’t speak the same language, or share the same culture –\u0026nbspor even the adopted expat one. In Asia, I felt more British and stuck in my ways than ever, which seemed like the opposite of the person I thought I was in Britain.And so the decision to move back wasn’t the proverbial lightning bolt. It was a slow blistering of the feeling that me, living in Hong Kong, wasn’t quite right. I frequently felt angry and upset and weak that I couldn’t settle in this most intoxicating of cities. The longer it went on, the more the issue of Brexit started to feel more and more abstract, and in some ways I was grateful for it happening: weren’t we lucky to live in a place that had at least some autonomy, however blunt, over the way the country was run?And so three and a half years almost to the day after setting foot on Hong Kong Island, I ditched the territory for Gatwick Airport (maybe the most British of all airports –\u0026nbspchaos inside, then surrounded by the gorgeous South Downs outside). I even left without my husband, such was my rush to move back.I’ve been home for around two months now, working for The Independent, where I don’t need to be careful about how I talk about China’s nationality complex: I can now write the words “Taiwan”\u0026nbspand “country”\u0026nbspnext to each other. I’ve realised that democracy means more than just voting for my next leader. It means being able to live in a place where I can speak freely, and be part of a dynamic and shouty media landscape unafraid to say what it thinks.The first night I was back, jet lagged and drunk after a bottle and more of wine, I cried in front of my friends about it being “the end of an era” –\u0026nbspand it is. I’ve transitioned with frightening ease back to my old life: I’m living in the same flat, I have the same friends, and I’ve gone back to eating the same thing for dinner. It’s almost like my three and half years abroad never happened.\u0026nbspThe crude difference is that I’ve reacquainted myself with the UK’s sluggish public services and an increased level of danger –\u0026nbspessentially the spoils that come with an open nation.Tangibly, plenty has changed. In the three and a half years I was away, my London neighbourhood, SE1, has sprouted an outdoor food market, and some hip performance space in what was a car park. The UK has its second female prime minister. I can pay for the Tube using Apple Pay, and everybody uses Uber\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspif they’re not getting on the Night Tube. Half the high street has disappeared and isn’t it great I can pick up my Amazon parcel from a locker?China defends decision to deny work visa for Financial Times editor Bus travel hits 12-year-low as prices rise and services axedWhere do the limits lie for ultra-long-haul air travel?And intangibly, plenty has changed. I feel like a different person. I’ve visited some of the most densely populated cities on earth that aren’t well-known (yet) in the UK. I’ve embedded myself into a culture completely separate from my own and seen how the developing world views the UK. I’ve learned\u0026nbspscraps of Mandarin and known bone-crushing loneliness. I’ve transitioned back to being the well-travelled one among my friends, whereas in Hong Kong I felt like the polar opposite.I can’t say it wasn’t gut-wrenching to leave a life and friends I loved, although the idea of not living in my home country again tore at something even more primal –\u0026nbspBrexit or no Brexit. I’ve at last accepted that I just didn’t like Hong Kong that much, however much I enjoyed the lifestyle.Now, back in London, I have moments of such vibrating happiness to walk along some dingy street in Elephant and Castle I feel I might burst. I wait for a delayed train and my heart feels full (I know, weird).\u0026nbspI’m back in my city, and I’m back on my sofa.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s not about them -\u0026nbspthe character -\u0026nbspbut the character imposed by the designer.”Vodianova – who was the world’s third highest earning model in 2012 and is currently ranked by models as one of the fashion industry’s New Supers – said the proliferation of social media has changed\u0026nbspthe whole fashion industry.“For young models, it’s really, really hard. It’s really hard without this following. I know a lot of brands are asking models how many followers they have – this dictates whether they get the job or not.\u0026nbsp“It’s interesting because that means personality is celebrated and it’s not really about the brand\u0027s\u0026nbspideal of the, let’s say, face. It’s crazy because very beautiful girls, or whatever that means, will miss out and the job will go out to someone who is very charismatic and funny and has a lot of personality. Some people find it unfair but I think it’s interesting.”The model, who does a range of campaigning work, noted the “competitive” nature of this shift but said it allowed for a greater ersity of models.She argued the growing influence of social media has led the industry to embrace a greater range of body shapes but it still had a long way to go.“A lot of it is forced by social media and by the fact more and more of these conversations are surfacing. The industry sort of follows it like a trend. Unfortunately, it is\u0026nbspstill not normalised enough.“The issues of one type of body and perfection are changing a lot because we now see consumers wanting to see more ersity,” she added. “Big influencers and the brands themselves now have a great presence on social media so they can hear from their consumers directly about what works and what does not. I think this is really positive.”\u0026nbspShe added: “Influence has gone from the industry-at-large to a mix of\u0026nbspimportant influencers.\u0026nbspThe newcomers and Instagram stars mean it is a very different landscape. It’s very interesting.”But she said the issue of body ersity has yet to revolutionise the world of catwalk high fashion – noting such designers create their clothes with slim women in mind.\u0026nbsp“That is the way they want to see it. But then often what is in the catwalk is not what you find in the shop,” she said.Asked whether she thought this provided a negative role model for young girls, she said the responsibility needed to lie with designers rather than the models themselves.Created with Sketch.Model with Down\u0027s syndrome makes strides worldwide Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Model Madeline Stuart, who has Down\u0027s syndrome,  standing on a runway during rehearsal at the Angel Orensanz Foundation during New York Fashion Week Madeline having her final touches made before before walking in the Colleen Morris presentation of the SpringSummer 2019 collection during London Fashion WeekMadeline has her makeup applied backstage before the Colleen Morris Presentation Madeline enjoying her time backstage of the Soiree show at London Fashion WeekMadeline walking onto the catwalk for the Colleen Morris presentation Madeline and her mother, Rosanne, pose for photos while sightseeing in Trafalgar Square Madeline walking in the Swedish School of Textiles show at London Fashion WeekMadeline celebrates after stepping out of a taxi cab as she arrives for New York Fashion WeekMadeline looks through a window as her mother is interviewed about Madeline\u0027s modelling careerRosanne Stuart attempts to cover her daughter, Madeline, from rain as they walk to a show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline waits backstage as a dress is steamed before a runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline having her make up applied backstage before walking in the Lulu Et Gigi presentation at New York Fashion WeekMadeline being assisted backstage before walking in the Rutu Bhonsle runway show at New York Fashion WeekMadeline standing backstage before walking in the Burning Guitars runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline standing backstage between two male models at New York Fashion WeekMadeline stands among models backstage after walking in the Burning Guitars presentation during New York Fashion WeekMadeline sits at the Remedy Diner with her mother and manager Rosanne after walking in a runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline sits in the back of a taxi cab after walking in a runway show during New York Fashion WeekModel Madeline Stuart, who has Down\u0027s syndrome,  standing on a runway during rehearsal at the Angel Orensanz Foundation during New York Fashion Week Madeline having her final touches made before before walking in the Colleen Morris presentation of the SpringSummer 2019 collection during London Fashion WeekMadeline has her makeup applied backstage before the Colleen Morris Presentation Madeline enjoying her time backstage of the Soiree show at London Fashion WeekMadeline walking onto the catwalk for the Colleen Morris presentation Madeline and her mother, Rosanne, pose for photos while sightseeing in Trafalgar Square Madeline walking in the Swedish School of Textiles show at London Fashion WeekMadeline celebrates after stepping out of a taxi cab as she arrives for New York Fashion WeekMadeline looks through a window as her mother is interviewed about Madeline\u0027s modelling careerRosanne Stuart attempts to cover her daughter, Madeline, from rain as they walk to a show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline waits backstage as a dress is steamed before a runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline having her make up applied backstage before walking in the Lulu Et Gigi presentation at New York Fashion WeekMadeline being assisted backstage before walking in the Rutu Bhonsle runway show at New York Fashion WeekMadeline standing backstage before walking in the Burning Guitars runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline standing backstage between two male models at New York Fashion WeekMadeline stands among models backstage after walking in the Burning Guitars presentation during New York Fashion WeekMadeline sits at the Remedy Diner with her mother and manager Rosanne after walking in a runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline sits in the back of a taxi cab after walking in a runway show during New York Fashion Week“What is it to do with catwalk models? We can’t blame catwalk models.\u0026nbspThey are beautiful. And they are often very healthy. They are naturally skinny,” she said. “Whether there should be more ersity, that is another story. A lot of these girls and a lot of these models were born this way. I was born this way so I can speak on their behalf.”\u0026nbspShe called for a greater variety of female body types to be represented on the catwalk. “There will always be a place for girls who are naturally slim, but I would love to see more beautiful, curvy women on the catwalk. I see a lot of these shows and I think it should be more like in real life.”\u0026nbspVodianova joined the United Nations Population Fund to lead a global symposium on tackling the taboos surrounding women’s health around the world in Antalya in Turkey on Thursday and Friday of this week.“Too often women’s health issues go unheard and unnoticed because of unwarranted stigmas and taboos which have let far too many women down for generations,” she said.She said the global issue of period poverty was close to her heart – revealing she was subject to fierce trolling after sharing a photo of herself holding a sanitary pad with her two million Instagram followers.The model said she received\u0026nbsparound 5,000 comments in less than ten hours and\u0026nbspthe reaction of Russian women to the image was “crazy”.“Most of it was harsh criticism saying ‘How can you do this? There are teenagers following you.\u0026nbspWhy don’t you start posting pictures sitting on the toilet? Why don’t you post toilet paper?’ I could not believe my eyes. I am not used to so much hate and criticism thrown my way.”\u0026nbsp“Then I thought this is really cool actually.\u0026nbspiIt proves my point that these conversations are so important. I just did not realise this\u0026nbspshame and stigma was so close to home in Russia.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.“It is unlikely that other animals would be affected because pheromones are so species specific,” said Professor Kazushige Touhara from the University of Tokyo, who led the project.“The sex-rejecting behaviour is an innate instinct, so it’s also unlikely that the mice will learn to change their behaviour.”A similar pheromone called ESP1 is produced by male mice to encourage sex, and the scientists found that ESP22 signals essentially replace these signals in the females’ brains.“ESP22 is difficult to artificially synthesise, so we want to find a smaller portion of the pheromone molecule that could be added to mouse drinking water,” said Professor Touhara.“This could prevent mice breeding in areas where they are pests.”The scientists noted that due to pheromones being highly species specific, direct connections between human and mouse behaviour could not be made in this case.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Lady Green owns all of the shares in their company, Taveta, which is registered in Jersey and controls Arcadia.\u0026nbspSir Philip has claimed he chose to live in the principality\u0026nbspbecause of a “heart scare” he had twenty years ago.Lady Green has pointed out other benefits to tax havens: “My understanding is that jurisdictions such as Jersey and the British Virgin Islands are commonly preferred for their strong regulatory regimes,” she wrote to MPs\u0026nbspin 2016.The Arcadia Group is the clothing empire that made Sir Philip’s reputation as a retail king and remains the source of much of his wealth. It boasts some of the biggest names on the high street: Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Evans, Burton and - the jewel in the crown - Topshop, which has successfully expanded into the US in recent years.But the rapid upward trajectory has recently reversed with the Arcadia’s value being slashed by half in just a year. Topshop’s revenues dropped 5.6 per cent last year, in spite of a jump in online sales.Topshop lost £10.9m in the year to August 2017, compared with a £59.4m profit in the previous 12 months. It also has a worrying pension deficit of up to £1bn - not the first time one of Sir Philip’s companies have experienced problems in that regard.The tycoon bought BHS for £200m in 2000 and took it back into private ownership. He rebranded it as British Home Stores and brought it under his Arcadia umbrella before ridding himself of it in 2015, by which time it had racked up £1.3bn in debt including a large pension deficit.\u0026nbspUntil the recent sexual harassment allegations it was Sir Philip’s conduct during and after the disposal of BHS that had most tarnished reputation.Pensions committee chair Sir Frank Field summed it up succinctly earlier this year: “Sir Philip Green stripped BHS bare and then left it for dead, with contemptuous disregard for the pensioners.”\u0026nbspPhilip Green\u0027s case is proof that we need to get rid of NDAs for good£500,000 in 28 seconds is the fastest money Philip Green has ever lostPhilip Green named in parliament as businessman who gagged mediaSurrounding himself with \u0027yes\u0027 men was Philip Green’s undoingAre Sir Philip Green and Frank Field up for a rematch? Let\u0027s just seeThe businessman sold BHS for £1 to a company controlled by a Dominic Chappell, a man who had been declared bankrupt three times and had no retail experience.\u0026nbspThe chain collapsed into administration a year later, with 11,000 jobs lost and a £571m deficit in the pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe Pensions Regulator found that the “main purpose” of the transaction was so that Sir Philip could avoid liability for the fund which contained 22,000 people’s retirement savings.Sir Philip came under heavy and sustained fire from the regulator and MPs, before eventually making a voluntary payment of £363m to help make up the deficit.\u0026nbspMPs recommend former BHS owner Sir Philip Green is stripped of knighthoodSir Philip owns three luxurious yachts including the 295ft Lionheart which he bought for £100m at about the same time as he took collection of a £46m Gulfstream private jet and offloaded BHS.He was believed to be holidaying on the Lionheart in the Mediterranean when he stated in September 2016 that he was “working every day” to save the stricken retailer’s pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe previous month he was filmed\u0026nbspon the Greek Island of Ithaca attacking a reporter who tried to question him about BHS’ demise. “That’s going in the f***** sea,” Sir Philip shouted while pointing towards the reporter’s camera equipment.The Pensions Regulator said at the time that the vessel could be seized in order to generate cash to pay into the BHS fund. In the end he kept both the yacht and his knighthood, though there will now be renewed calls for him to be stripped of the latter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The World Health Organisation has warned such pollution, much of which is from the fossil fuels that cause climate change, is a “public health emergency”.Water levels in reservoirs, like this one in Gers, France, have been getting perilously low in areas across the world affected by drought, forcing authorities to introduce water restrictions.The letter comes after the Campaign to Protect Rural England claimed that the million homes proposed as part of the project would require a massive area of countryside to be converted.Local activists are concerned that the proposed £5.5bn project would also lead to a surge in carbon emissions and air pollution across the region, and have questioned whether it is necessary.However, the government has stated that the “brain belt” linking the two major university cities would provide a massive economic boost for the region.They have also emphasised the importance of the accompanying construction project to make up for the massive shortfall in homes being built.Mr Taylor, a member of the European Parliament’s transport committee, said he was not in favour of more road building and called instead for investment in local train lines.That the planned road will run parallel to a much-needed East-West rail link that has already been downgraded from electric to diesel just adds air pollution insult to environmental injury,” he said.He said avoiding more carbon emissions was a particularly urgent priority considering the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report laying out the thresholds required to avoid dangerous global warming.In response, a Department for Transport spokesperson said:\u0026nbspThe Oxford to Cambridge Expressway will enhance transport connectivity and growth across the region and for the benefit of the UK as a whole.We have been engaging with community groups about developing ideas for a road in this area since 2016, and we expect to consult on specific proposals, developed with the help of local communities, next year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspBrussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

This is my firm belief and this is my understanding of democracy.”Mr Bullmann’s intervention is particularly significant because EU figures have so far been reticent to call for a second vote – for fear they might be seen as interfering in Britain\u0027s\u0026nbsppolitics.But the vast show of support on the streets of the capital has apparently encouraged some in Brussels and Strasbourg to break cover and speak out.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

Amazon shares dropped as much as 8 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported quarterly sales of $56.58bn (£44.16bn), missing expectations of $57.1bn. Alphabet’s stock fell 4.7 per cent after it posted revenue of $33.74bn, missing Wall Street’s target of $34.04bn, although earnings of $13.06 per share came in well ahead of the expected $10.42 per share. Google reveals it has sacked 48 employees over sexual harassmentGoogle leak reveals plans for censored search engine in ChinaEbay sues Amazon, accusing rival of illegally poaching sellersAmazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employees“Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing. “But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.”Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “poorly received” earnings from Alphabet and Amazon had “soured the mood on what had been a rebounding US session”. However, Christopher Rossbach, CIO of investment firm J. Stern \u0026amp Co, said the companies both remain fundamentally strong, despite missing market expectations. “While their revenues were both slightly lower than expected, with Amazon additionally guiding slightly lower than street expectations for the next quarter, they still both show good profitability,” he said. \u0026nbsp“Alphabet is the leader in search and advertising, and Amazon is the leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, and increasingly benefits from advertising too. The fundamentals of both companies are intact and we believe that any significant weakness is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.”Other tech stocks that dipped in after-hours include Apple, which fell 1.6 per cent, and Twitter, which was down 2.5 per cent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Sea Shepherd Cove s group says the 2018-19 quota is 2,040, although most years fewer than 1,000 animals are usually taken. Critics say the cap is set high to make the real number killed appear low.Nikki Botha, from Sea Shepherd,\u0026nbspwho is often based at the port monitoring the hunt, told The Independent the world would be horrified if people knew how babies are regularly thrown back into the sea just to die.“These young animals are separated from their mothers and pod mates as hunters don’t want to waste their self-imposed quota on such a small amount of ‘product’,” she said.“The chances of survival of these young animals are extremely slim without the protection of their pod and their mothers’ guidance in survival.She said she had seen\u0026nbsphunters laughing at the animals’\u0026nbspdistress.Once the cove went silent and the tarps were fully drawn back, our team got a glimpse of bright red blood in the shallowsIn the wild, dolphin calves consume their mothers’ milk for about the first two years of life, then stay with them for up to six more years.Campaigners say that even if a youngster was able to survive physically being orphaned, seeing its family slaughtered would leave it highly traumatised.The port of Taiji has become a byword among campaigners for the “barbarity” of devastating dolphin families and turning the ocean red with blood.Sea Shepherd has this season counted four captives, four juveniles returned to the sea and 18 adults slaughtered, across four hunt drives.Last month, the Ric O’Barry’s Dolphin Project group, which also has volunteers in place, reported how a pod of Risso’s dolphins was driven into the cove “where they met a heartbreaking fate”.“Among them were two traumatised juveniles, which were taken from their mothers’ sides and dumped back out at sea,” the group said.“The remaining ones were dragged under the cove’s tarps and slaughtered. A skiff went under the tarps and came out dragging the carcasses of the five remaining Risso’s, under a grey cover.Taiji harbour (Ric O’Barry’s Dolphin Project)“Once the cove went silent and the tarps were fully drawn back, our team got a glimpse of bright red blood in the shallows.”Dolphin drive hunts are carried out by fleets of boats that chase pods on migration routes by banging on metal poles placed in the sea to create a wall of sound that drives the mammals towards the shore.Dolphins depend on echolocation – using sound waves that bounce off objects – to navigate under water, so are susceptible to the technique.Once cornered, they are killed for meat – despite warnings that their flesh is contaminated with mercury – or held in pens and sold to dolphinariums where they spend their lives in pools that are condemned for being just a fraction of the size of the oceans they would use in the wild.Hunters receive about $500 (£380) for a dead dolphin sold for meat, but the Taiji Whale Museum, which buys them live from hunters and holds them in pens at the harbour, receives more than $150,000 from aquariums for one that has been trained, according to Ric O’Barry’s Dolphin Project. The museum subsidises the drive hunts for that reason.Last week monitors photographed a trainer inserting a tube into a “seemingly unwilling” dolphin. “Captured dolphins are conditioned to accept these unpleasant sensations on a regular basis to prepare them for procedures such as force feeding and blood draws,” a volunteer said.\u0026nbspThe group also reported how three Risso’s dolphins held in Taiji’s harbour were reluctant to eat after being caught. After a few days they started to accept squid thrown in the water by trainers.\u0026nbspBut the Cove s reported that one in particular was in trouble. Niji was completely uninterested in food and her behaviour had changed.Niji\u0026nbspwas uninterested in food and is clearly depressed“In previous days, her surface time and location were steady, predictable and repetitive. This morning her surfacing pattern was erratic – anywhere from 7 to 34 seconds.“This afternoon, however, we noticed something worrying. Each time Niji surfaced, she was lopsided, favouring her right side. This is not a good sign. It is clear that she is depressed and struggling to adjust to her new circumstances.“Needless to say we are very, very worried about her.”Niji was not fed at all today, they said.On another occasion, witnesses saw a pod of eight driven into the cove where five adults were slaughtered, a juvenile was taken into captivity and two others were dumped back at sea.Three\u0026nbspweeks ago four dolphins owned by the Taiji Whale Museum and held in harbour pens died in the typhoon that swept Japan.Created with Sketch.Dying to make us happy: The bloody truth behind the dolphinarium Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.At least one died of respiratory failure, and it’s feared others were injured.Anna Oliver, of Sea Shepherd UK, said they might have been hit by flying debris or died of stress or dehydration if they were not fed during the storm.Taiji’s mayor has said in the long term he wants to convert a bay into a massive dolphin pool as a “research centre”, suggesting he has no intention of heeding calls for the hunting to end.Annual dolphin catches have declined, in part because of growing awareness of international distaste for the hunt and alarm over mercury poisoning, and in part because of 2009 documentary The Cove, in which Ric O’Barry revealed the practices used at Taiji.The Japanese embassy in the UK declined to comment when contacted by The Independent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Today, we\u0026rsquoll turn our attention to renters.According to a study carried out by the Resolution Foundation, the number of households privately rented by families jumped from less than one million in 2003 to almost two million in 2016.In the same period, homes owned or bought by families decreased from almost five million to just over three million.And in the 10 years up to April 2017, the proportion of people renting their home from a private landlord increased across all working age groups.

Landlords will be hit financially if they can\u0026rsquot find new tenants to let the properties.\u0026ldquoThis will have a knock-on effect on rental prices.\u0026ldquoIn areas where there is then an oversupply of rental properties, landlords will be forced to reduce rents or sell.\u0026ldquoOverall, across the UK as a whole, a no-deal Brexit would likely only cause a marginal decline in rental prices and it would be relatively localised to these areas EU workers leave.

Smoking tobacco is bad news.But vaping is dferent.You heat up a solution called an e-liquid, which typically contains nicotine, a propellant called propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin and flavourings.What you don’t do is burn tobacco or produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of the most harmful elements of all in tobacco smoke.Sure, some vapes may contain a fraction of some of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but they are present at much lower levels,detectable at all.So are they safe  According to all the international medically-reviewed evidence from such expert organisations as Public Health England, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK, e-cigarettes are at least  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.The American Cancer Society and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine both agree with them.Yes, the nicotine, of course, is addictive. But so what  So is caffeine, even eating.Contrary to popular belief, nicotine does not give you cancer and it is relatively harmless generally.Apparently only  per cent of the population know this.Happily, there is no evidence of harm to other people from vaping and,used instead of nicotine replacement gum or patches, may even help expectant mums remain smoke-free in the long term.As a doctor I don’t want any young person or non-nicotine user to try vaping. Ever. Period.As it happens, regular use of e-cigs among “never” smokers is still very rare at just . per cent.But look at what they’ve done to help tobacco smokers quit.In the UK, .million vapers have quit smoking completely and more than , have given up both smoking and vaping.In fact, this is Britain’s most popular method of quitting with two-thirds stopping successfully when used alongside professional stop-smoking NHS support.In this country we have some of the strictest regulations in the world.E-cigs are subject to minimum standards of quality and safety as well as clear packaging and labelling requirements.All ingredients have to be notied, advertising is prohibited in media such as television, newspapers and magazines, it is illegal to sell them to under s and to adults intending to pass them on to under s.That is responsible regulation whichever way you look at it.This month’s national Stoptober campaign recommends using e- cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid andit helps some of the million smokers in the UK kick the habit for good then perhaps doctors like me will see fewer people in our surgeries struggling to breath or devastated by a cancer diagnosis.AndI see any ex-smoking patients of mine having a quiet vape outside my surgery door, I shall give them a heartfelt pat on the back and cherish the fact that there will be one less nasty fag end polluting the street.NICOTINE contained in e-liquids is a highly addictive substance that raises blood pressure and spikes your adrenalin, increasing the chances of having a heart attack.This is particularly worrying as we see a number of iniduals who are constantly vaping, especially as it is seen as more convenient and cost-effective than lighting up a cigarette, as well as being considered more socially acceptable to vape indoors.While vaping appears to be safer than cigarettes, the truth is that it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know the potential damage it can cause to our health.The long-term effects of the chemicals contained in e-liquids haven’t been examined.However, I have looked into ious research that has been carried out on certain e-liquids that were found to contain substances that can cause damage to the immune system and are linked to other health conditions such as cancer.Vaping isn’t great for your oral health either.It’s common for vaping to cause a dry mouth, and I’ve met a number of iniduals who have developed oral thrush, most likely caused by vaping.Although nicotine does not have a colour, it becomes yellow when combined with oxygen which could lead to tooth discolouration.As nicotine is a vasocon-strictor, it limits blood flow in oral tissue, which can cause gum disease and bad breath.As time goes on, I am reading new research which proves vaping has a negative effect on health.To what extent, only time will tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why do they not get paid what they are worth to their company, and why are so many overlooked for promotion The sad fact is that for every £ men earn, women make just  pence.Just over one in ten women negotiated their starting salary, while more than half of all men haggle with their boss before they have even started work.When women do ask for more pay, they are  per cent less likely to get a raise. Andthey do receive a wage increase it will be  per cent less than men get.Sadly, it is common in business that women are often viewed as weak or unable to cope. And once we think about or start a family, we become toxic to employers.I receive hundreds of direct messages on social media from women asking: “How do I get a pay rise  How do I get noticed at work  How can I get promoted  How can I get on after maternity leave ”So now I am launching Get What You Want, a series of online masterclasses and podcasts covering everything from getting promoted to dealing with the word no, overcoming challenges, negotiating pay, writing a fantastic CV and nailing an interview.It will also cover baby-proofing careers, as well as becoming a super-mum after maternity leave.A lot of women have skills but just lack confidence. As women, we don’t shout about our wins enough for fear we will appear arrogant, even though men talk about them all the time.Here are some of my tips to winning at work.When people say: “I hate my job” I always ask: “Why are you telling me  I can’t do anything about it.”YOU have to do something. Sit down and work out what it is you don’t like about the position and set yourself a task of getting a new one.Be very dedicated and very professional and excel when you get to the interview.Many people don’t realise that when you are invited for an interview it is because they believe you can do the job.The secret is convincing them that you can do the job better than anyone .You should be able to talk about your specialist subject, which is yourself.People find it very dficult to list all the things they have done really well in a professional way to show good examples of why they can do the job.Opening a negotiation is all about knowing your worth.And knowing your value is really about your self-worth. They are totally linked.Write down all the things where you have made a big ­contribution, all the things that you have changed and made a dference, how you have added value. Put together testimonials to really back up what you have done.Then work out what more you want to do, because going above and beyond your job description is very important.Take out all the emotion, go in and lay out for your boss the facts of what you’ve contributed to the organisation.Sometimes people can be very passive. They say: “I’ll go along with what everyone  agrees with.”They want to avoid conflict. They don’t really think their opinion is as important as other people’s, so they are simply giving others a licence to ignore them.Learn to say no. Say: “I don’t really have the time butI can make the time I can do it for you.” Otherwise you become like a human sponge. Don’t let them take advantage.Employers take advantage of women’s lack of confidence, especially a mother ing from maternity leave. Many feel so grateful to have a job that they tend to put up with almost anything.Eleven per cent of new mothers report that they have been dismissed or made redundant where others in their workplace were not, or were treated so poorly they felt they had to leave.That means as many as , women are losing their jobs each year.Have a really clear plan of how you will manage at home and manage work.

Ms Knightley, who adds, “Rescue yourself,” clearly feels she is protecting daughter Edie by banning something that doesn’t concur with her own off-the-shelf, Poundland version of what feminism should be.But what she’s in danger of doing is wilfully nurturing a potential “snowflake” who, rather than develop the critical thinking skills that allow healthy debate, will simply stick their fingers in their ears and cry foul when they see or hear something that dfers from their own world view.Keira, tonight’s homework is to really readCinderella and analyse it.Look past the Disney-esque cute rodents, pretty frocks and glass slippers and instead dig a little deeper to ­appreciate the original’s narrative of how hope can turn unjust oppression into ­triumphant reward.Cinderella is a young woman who has not only suffered the loss of her loving father, but now faces a letime of abuse from an uncaring stepmother and her equally unpleasant daughters.But instead of sitting in the ashes ­waiting unquestioningly for whatever fate might have in store for her, she remains resolutely ­optimistic and decides to secretly defy her nemesis by gatecrashing a hot-ticket party to which she hasn’t been invited.Now that’s girl power.Ultimately, she “‘rescues” herself by proactively going to the ball where, instead of abuse, she experiences the redemptive qualities of love and kindness.They just happen to come in the form of a handsome prince.In the same week, Kristen Bell — who coincidentally voices Anna in the Disney film Frozen — found herself caught up in the slipstream of Keira’s PC virtue signalling after reportedly saying that Snow White gives young girls the wrong ­message about consent “because you cannot kiss someonethey’re sleeping”.Except Kristen’s comment was taken out of context and she’s got the balance right.Because what she actually said was that she reads the story with her two ­daughters, aged five and three, then asks them: “Don’t you think it’s weird that Snow White didn’t ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple ” before starting up a conversation about the dos and don’ts of taking food from strangers.Or, “Don’t you think that it’s weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission ” to float an almost subliminal, age-appropriate understanding of what does and doesn’t constitute ­consent.Kristen isn’t banning tales of old, she’s using them to stimulate discussions.In other words, teaching her children the vital le skills of critical thinking — dictionary definition: “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment” — and being able to rationally debate that judgment with someone whose view might dfer from your own.Attempting to sanitise a child’s world by airbrushing history will hinder, not help them.Instead, wield history’s lessons as a tool to educate.Cinderella was of its time and now the Disney pendulum has seemingly swung the other way to depict a world where all the central characters are feisty, opinionated young women who power-kick their way through le.But how will Keira’s daughter know how far the depiction of Disney ­princesses has comeshe’s not allowed to see where they’ve been ONE morning last week, I spent a glorious couple of hours walking around Westminster Abbey.Buried or commemorated there are, among others, more than , great Britonsincluding Sir Isaac Newton, Jane Austen, Noel Coward, Charles Darwin, the Bronte sisters, Clement Attlee, Charles Dickens, David Livingstone, Stephen Hawking and, of course, the grave of the unknown warrior, buried on November ,  “in honour of the many multitudes who during the Great War of - gave the most that man can give . . . le itself.”My mother works at the Abbey as a “blue-gowner” – the volunteer guides there to answer any questions not covered by the electronic headsets – and, while showing us the ft by ft grave of poet Ben Jonson, who is the only person there to be buried upright, she was approached by a couple of earnest-looking women in their early twenties.Amid such a rich seam of history, rigorous intellect and achievement, what did they ask “Excuse me, where did David Beckham sit for the royal wedding ”THE number of stay-at-home dads has dropped to the lowest level in five years.Experts reckon it could be due to men “growing tired” of the tough job of raising kids.Proof,needed, might be the glassy-eyed expression of Bond actor Daniel Craig,  just six weeks after we Rachel Weisz gave birth to their daughter.He never looks this knackered when he’s jumping off buildings and dodging bullets.Stay-at-home parenthood can be isolating, sometimes dull, frequently thankless and relentlessly bloody exhausting. Only the strong survive it.THANKS to Ryanair’s ­astonishing failure to act when a passenger racially abused Windrush immigrant Delsie Gayle on one of its flights, the man will likely escape prosecution because of jurisdictional issues once a plane takes off from one country’s airspace to another.Instead, he is likely only to be banned from ever travelling on Ryanair again.Which, as plenty of the budget airline’s past ­customers might tell you, could equally be regarded as a blessing rather than a punishment.COMEDIAN Seann Walsh and his Strictly partner Katya Jones have survived the dreaded dance-off to, presumably, jive another day.Because, let’s face it, since that snog, the Strictly bosses are ­rapidly running out of drearily chaste dances to give them.Last weekend it was the unsexy Charleston, ­performed in equally unsexy “Where’s Wally” outfits that virtually screamed “nothing to see here”. Then this weekend it was a faintly ­ludicrous, undeniably platonic quickstep that saw them trotting around the floor like a couple of hyperactive show ponies.Assuming the sizzling Argentine tango is, er, strictly no-go, whatever next  A jive in burkas  A Viennese waltz in sackcloths Not least from Tom himself, perhaps, whose first we Mimi Rogers bemoaned the lack of intimacy in their union because, she claims, he wanted to be a monk and “thought he had to be celibate to maintain the purity of his instrument, but my instrument needed tuning, and we had to split.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The African plate is subdacting, going under, and the European plate we say itsabout cm a year.So all this middle and southern Mediterranean is a very active zone, so it has produced many earthquakes in historical times and in the present.We have stories collected from historical times from a large earthquake magnitude . offshore near Crete in AD which produced a tsunami and reached even Egypt.We have another in AD near Sicily, which devastated some cities in Sicily and caused a tsunami.Large scale earthquakes will continue to go ahead in Italy and Greece. But not only big earthquakes are associated with big risk.She cited last years . magnitude earthquake which struck central Italy as one example of a moderate tremor that can cause carnage.This hit on January  a few kilometres northwest of the town of LAquila, killing  people and laying waste to several ancient towns.She added: Risk comes even from moderate earthquakes, they tend to happen every five years in these countries. They are more frequent than large ones.Last year scientists said they expected an increase in earthquakes due to a tiny decrease in the speed of the planets rotation.A report presented at the Geological Society of America argued that five periods of intense seismic activity throughout history have followed periods of when the Earths rotation slowed.However, Segou did not believe the frequency of the tremors hitting Europe was increasing.Associate Professor of Earthquake Science in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne, Mark Quigley has previously told news.au central Italy is experiencing crustal extension.He says: Eastern central Italy is moving to the NE relative to Rome.As a result, this region experiences normal faulting earthquakes as the land is torn apart. The fault systems are short and structurally complex, so the earthquakes are not overly large by global standards.But because the earthquakes are shallow and structurally complex, and because many of the local towns and cities contain vulnerable buildings, strong shaking from these earthquakes has the potential to inflict major damage and loss of le in urban areas.Some  per cent occur around the rim of the Pacic Ocean.The plates - giant rock slabs that make up the Earths upper layer - are always slowly moving.They often collide and slide against each other, according to National Geographic.This impact can be unnoticeable on the surface but can cause immense stress between the plates.When this stress is released, it causes massive vibrations, called seismic waves, often hundreds of miles through the rock to the surface.There are fears that there is a big one on the way after a flurry of volcanic activity in the Pacics Ring of Fire.A study from Calornia says that the cluster of tremors around the planets so-called Ring of Fire- a horseshoe-shaped geological disaster zone - could indicate the big one is due to hit.The research, published in the journal Science Advances, involved analysis of  major earthquakes around the Pacic Ring of Fire between  and .Europe also has a number of volcanoes - some dormant, others active - which have in the past caused catastrophic events and huge loss of le.Among these is Mount Etna, on Sicily, which was first recorded erupting in BC, and has exploded around  times since.This last occurred in  when a BBC crew were pelted with boiling rocks and steam as they filmed the mountainside.Many in Europe also remember the  eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull, in Iceland, which triggered huge air travel disruptions across western and northern Europe.Last year, researchers at the University of Leeds revealed the findings of a study which determined such ash cloud eruptions could occur once every  years.Co-author Dr Graeme Swindles said: In , when Eyjafjallajökull erupted, people were really shocked – it seemed to come completely out of the blue, but the eruption of Grímsvötn, the following year, was an extraordinary coincidence.Although it is possible that ash clouds can occur on an annual basis, the averageinterval for the last , years is around  years.The last time volcanic ash clouds affected northern Europe before the recent event was in ,  years ago – but aviation was much less intense at that time and it simply didnt have the same sort of impact.Our research shows that, over thousands of years, these sorts of incidents are not that rare – but people wondering how likely it is that the  chaos will be repeated in the next few years can feel somewhat reassured.Just this year alone the world has witnessed destructive eruptions in Hawaii, Bali and Guatemala.However, Clive Oppenheimer, professor of volcanology at the University of Cambridge, says there has not been an increase in volcanic activity.He told The : There have been quite a few eruptions in the news lately, so people question whether there’s an increase in rates of volcanism that we’re seeing just now, and this isn’t really the case.Eruptions are happening all the time - some make the news headlines and others don’t.If we look at the statistics back in time, the main thing we see is a reporting bias. There are not many eruptions during World War Two, for example, when people had other things to really worry about.So of course things will flare up in one place or another place and then it will be very much how those eruptions affect people and whereabouts in the world - whether that then becomes newsworthy."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000424503091.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sewage drinking water thames bosses","story":"Thames Water said today the UKs capital will lose £ million a daydramatic measures arent put in place to save the citys water supply.The population of London is set to rise by two million people in the next  years which could lead to a million litre daily shortfall of water, made worse by climate change reducing natural resources.So Thames Water plans to open a reuse plant at the Deephams Sewage Treatment Works in North East London which will turn sewage into water clean enough to drink - a UK first, the Evening Standard reports.But the plant is not currently planned for everyday use - its intended for times of projected or actual drought.Discussions with the Environment Agency are ongoing about the viability of this plan.After plans to build a new £.billion reservoir in Oxfordshire were rejected by the government in , the plan is being revived by Thames Water.It is intended for water to be shipped down the Thames along the Oxford Canal to ensure taps keep flowing.The reservoir near Abingdon would play a vital role in supplying water to the South East.It will be complete by ,the government approves it.Thames Water also owns the UKs only desalination plant in Beckton, East London, which turns sea water into million litres of drinking water a day during drought.The company has a water resources management plan for the next  years which has budgeted £.billion until .A spokesperson said Thames Water is pledging to reduce leakage from its ,-mile network of pipes.He added: “More needs to be done to protect Londoners from the risk of severe drought.“Restrictions on water use in London alone could cost more than £million a day.”The reuse plant will put million litres of water a day back into the system by passing treated sewage through a desalination membrane to clean it.Its then mixed with reservoir water, treated again and pumped into the network.The spokesperson added: “We wouldn’t consider reusewe didn’t think the water would be good enough.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000444672952.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"quaker oats advert small print faecal","story":"It appears over a scene of a woman cutting an apple next to a box of Quaker Oats rolled oats.The text that appears at the bottom of the screen said: “Oat Grain Fibre contributes to an increase in faecal bulk.“Quaker Rolled Oats contains g of fibre g.”Nick Walker shared the stills from the commercial and zoomed in on “faecal bulk”.He tweeted one word: “Wow.”The words appear on the screen for  out of the  second commercial.Others replied to the tweet appearing to take in the gross word in good humour.One said: “Gonna need to see a doctors note that says ‘bulky faeces’.”Another added: “If you dont generally worry about your faecal bulk, then youre not the target audience you lucky, lucky lads.”One jibed: “Its faecal bulk day at the gym.”One person was in disbelief when they said: “This was on a real ad ”The TV ad shows a woman waking up and going through her daily routine.She stretches in the kitchen before making her rolled oats and heading to the gym where she appears to train as a gymnast.The words “High in fibre” also flash on the screen.The Sun Online has contacted Quaker Oats for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000443829246-e1540575001154.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"remembrance sunday cenotaph wreath german president","story":"President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has been invited in a “historic act of reconciliation” to mark  years since the end of World War One.PM Theresa May said: “Remembrance Sunday gives all of us the chance to remember the immense sacrices made in war.“I look forward to welcoming President Steinmeier to this year’s ceremony.”He will also join a service at Westminster Abbey.When The Sun revealed the plans last month, ex-Army chief Field Marshal Lord Guthrie insisted the ceremony was “peculiarly British”.He added: “For the Germans to be there wouldn’t be understood by a lot of people.”But Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said the move shows “the peace that exists between our two nations today”.The Royal British Legion said it was the Government’s decision who to invite.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was utterly mesmerised by Gita.”Born Gisela Furman, Gita had been sent to Lale, a fellow Slovakian, to have her existing tattoo redone because it had faded.After the inking, smitten Lale was desperate to see her again — so he summoned up the courage to ask a “helpful” SS officer called Baretski to smuggle letters to her in one of the women’s blocks.Lale described sending the first note as “the best and the most stupid” thing he’d ever done in his le.Heather said: “He knew he was risking both their lives but he still thought it was worth the risk.”And it paid off — the letters led to snatched visits outside Gita’s block, where her friends would form a circle around the pair to give them privacy.The writer continued: “Even when she had her head shaved and was dressed in rags he thought of her as the most beautul thing he ever saw.”Yet Gita was initially against a relationship.Heather, a retired social worker, explained: “What was the point of putting themselves in danger “But Lale always knew he was going to survive and tried to convince her there was hope.”That was an astounding feat of optimism from Lale, who had managed a department store before being sent to Auschwitz in April .On one day alone he watched as all , gypsy inmates of the camp were sent to the gas chambers.Lale also had to work with Dr Josef Mengele, the twisted medic who performed agonising and often lethal experiments on the prisoners.The tattooist was more terried of Mengele than of any other Nazi in the camp, but was required to stand beside him as he selected victims.The doctor would lean into Lale and whisper, “One day, tetovierer , one day I will take you.”Heather said: “No one scared Lale like Mengele. He would take out his gun and hold it to Lale’s head.“Lale would drop his tattooing needle because he’d be shaking.”Despite the wretchedness of his le, Lale always considered himself one of the lucky ones.His position as the “tetovierer” afforded him privileges — extra food and medicine, and a freedom of movement that allowed his love with Gita to bloom.Heather said: “He rationalised his role as the tattooist quite well. He said that the people who came to him were lucky too. “If you were being numbered that meant they weren’t heading straight to the gas chamber.”But when Heather tried to get Lale to go into detail about his feelings concerning his role, he would veer off and talk about Gita.She said: “To him, their love story was all that mattered. I put it to him, ‘Do you realise that you were marking the most iconic symbols of the entire Holocaust ’ He replied, ‘No, it’s about Gita. You tell everyone how much I loved Gita’.”Lale had been working in Bratislava when he heard that all the Jews in his hometown of Krompachy were to be rounded up to be sent to “labour camps”.Young and fit, he ed home and offered himself to authorities, hoping he might save his ageing parents from being taken.He became part of the first transport of Jewish prisoners to Auschwitz, where he was tattooed with the number  and put to work building housing blocks.Soon afterwards he was approached by the incumbent tattooist, Pepan, who askedhe would work with him. Lale knew five languages — useful in the job.Pepan disappeared weeks later and Lale was left with the job. He met Gita in July that year.Their courtship lasted three years. Then, in , as Russian troops moved towards the camp in Poland, the prisoners were moved out.Gita was sent on a so-called Death March along with the other women in the camp, while Lale was moved to a dferent camp in Mauthausen, Austria.There he managed escape by swimming across the Danube and made his way home to Slovakia. He learned that his parents had both died in Auschwitz. And he had no ideaGita was alive.Desperate, he took a horse and cart to Bratislava, the entry point for many survivors ing home, and waited at the railway station for weeks hoping to spot her.Then someone told him to look for her at the Red Cross HQ. On the way there, she suddenly appeared in front of his cart.Heather said: “I honestly worried about that when Lale relayed the story. It’s such a Hollywood ending that I didn’t think people would believe it.“Remarkably, I have evidence from Gita backing it up.“While she never spoke about her time in Auschwitz, Lale convinced her to make a testimony to Steven Spielberg’s Shoah Foundation.“In the video footage she said that she remembered walking down the street in Bratislava with two of her friends when one of them pointed out a horse coming down the street towards them with a tiny little cart on the side with this funny man standing on the back.“She said, ‘I looked up and it was Lale, so I stepped in front of the horse. That is the only time I’ve ever known Lale when he was speechless’.” The pair married in October  and emigrated to Melbourne, Australia, where they had a son, Gary, in .They set up a textile business and made a pact not to tell anyone how they met — with Lale worried he might be seen as a Nazi collaborator because he “helped” them by doing the tattoos.Even their son didn’t know.But when Gita died in , aged , Lale finally felt ready to talk.Heather recalled: “A friend put us in touch — I knew he had a story to tell but I had no idea what it would be.“He was obviously an old man and he said we needed to work fast because he was ready to be with his we again.”Lale died in , three days after his th birthday — and two hours after Heather’s last visit. She said: “The last thing I said to Lale on his last day on earth was, ‘I will never, ever stop telling your story’.”He died too soon to see Heather’s novel become a global smash hit.But Heather said: “Lale would have been so delighted.“I have to pinch myself, really. I’m absolutely astonished by the response to this book.“But I think it’s the hope that’s really resonating with people.

Stephen Barry asked what was wrong.“Stephen,” he said, “Is it possible to love two women at the same time ”Despite both their fears, the pair tied the knot in front of a congregation of , people, with some  million tuning in to watch the event on TV.But Camilla Parker-Bowles would be a thorn in Diana’s side throughout her marriage to Prince Charles.She saw her as the other woman, and it was later revealed the pair had a relationship while Princes Charles was still married.In her explosive interview with Martin Bashir, Princess Diana infamously said there were “three people” in her marriage.Prince Charles later went on to marry Camilla in , but she refrains from using the title the Princess of Wales out of respect for Diana."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000444612423.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"outcry after sadiq khan travels to brussels to beg eu to delay brexit until britain has second referendum or new government","story":"The Labour chief told Michel Barnier he should start preparing to extend Article  until a second referendum can be held or a new government formed to “reset” negotiations.Mr Khan said the alternative was “political and economic crisis”.Speaking during his Brussels visit he said: “What happens over the coming weeks and months will have an enormous impact on London, the UK and all of Europe for many decades to come”.And he claimed: “It’s now extremely likely that Parliament will vote down any bad deal negotiated by Theresa May, which means it will be in the best interests of both the UK and the EU to extend Article  in order to leave time for either a public vote or for a new government to reset the negotiations.”But furious Brexiteers hit back to tell the London Mayor to focus on getting the murder rate down back home in the Capital.And London Assembly Member Keith Prince accused Mr Khan of trying of “sabotaging” the negotiations.He tweeted: “Not content with going back on his repeated promises to respect the result by backing a second referendum, @SadiqKhan is now seeking to sabotage the Brexit negotiations.“All the while he is ignoring his day job and failing Londoners on transport, housing and policing.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In many cases the ‘debt’ has been sold onto a third party.Ms Creasy told The Sun: “The Chancellor talks about reviewing PFI for the future but our schools and hospitals are struggling and cutting services now.“PFI companies are the payday lenders of the public sector and for too long Governments of all colours have borrowed from these high cost creditors.“Not only should we stop using these kinds of PFI deals, we should also tackle the damage done.”PFI was launched by Sir John Major’s Conservative government  before exploding under Tony Blair’s Labour.

Among those are high profile former ministers including Amber Rudd and Iain Duncan Smith - the architect of the governments flagship welfare scheme. Ministers including Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns, Environment Minister George Eustice and Work and Pensions Minister Alok Sharma could also be rejected at the polls. Analysis by campaign group  degrees shows these constituencies have more people who could be moved onto Universal Credit - potentially losing them money - than the MPs majority. If just a fth of those affected are Conservative voters who switch their vote, the Conservative party could lose so many seats at any election they struggle to work even a minority government.  It comes as a public spending watchdog found Universal Credit is causing “unacceptable hardship” for many of its claimants. The Public Accounts Committee said the Tory “fortress mentality” is failing claimants who are struggling to adapt. Universal Credit, which is being rolled out gradually, replaces six existing benefits with a single payment - but critics have argued the programme, which has been subject to several delays, is flawed. A report by the Child Poverty Action Group suggests single parents face a cut in their income of pound, a year, families with two children could lose pound, on average and families with three children face a cut of pound,.Despite being the architect of UC, Iain Duncan-Smith has himself quit the Cabinet over welfare cuts and has demanded another poundbillion be pumped into Universal Credit to make it work.

David Ferguson, from Bangor in Northern Ireland, was flying back to Belfast with his dog Jamie following a trip to southern Portugal. The pair were scheduled to take the .pm easyJet flight from Faro to Belfast City Airport on theirjourney home when they encountered problems. After boarding the aircraft, David says a flight attendant demanded he attach a seatbelt extender to his dog Jamie - something which David deemed unsafe as it was made for humans and not for dogs. The retired -year-old refused to use the extender because he feared for Jamies safety in the event of a crash.  David and Jamie have previously boarded flights to Gatwick and Spain without issue using a cushioned harness he provides for plane journeys. The safety harness is approved for use on airplanes by the Civil Aviation Authority, David says. David suffers from Usher syndrome, a disorder that causes loss of both hearing and vision, and says he struggled to understand the companys staff.The flight was held up for  minutes while he negotiated with crew - but was eventually booted off the plane. At one stage, a pilot for the airline intervened in the dispute but found nothing wrong with seat belt extender. I was humiliated in front of the people on that aircraft, he said. Ive been with my dog  hours a day since I got him six years ago and as blind people were told to always know where our dogs are at all times.  Theres no way I would put him in danger or allow anyone to put him in danger. The airline effectively left a blind person stranded in the airport with almost no way of getting home. David originally booked his holiday with Thomas Cook and says he was surprised when he discovered that he would be flying with easyJet. After being kicked off the plane, David was left with no alternative but to fork out €for a Ryanair flight back to Dublin. Once there, had to endure a two-hour bus trip to Belfast from the Irish capital. David arrived home at .am thanks to help from his good friend Kenny Tosh who drove him back from the airport. He says his quality of le has improved dramatically since he was given the eight-year-old Labrador back in . He has literally changed my le, David said.  Before I had Jamie I was afraid to leave the house on my own unless someone picked me up. At one stage I walked into a lamppost and I was nearly knocked over. David has demanded airline staff be better informed about the challenges faced by blind people when travelling on their aircraft. If this is how they treat blind people Id be amazed to see how they treat able-bodied persons, he said. An easyJet statement toread: Unfortunately Mr Ferguson and his guide dog were not permitted to travel from Faro to Belfast on September  as he failed to comply with on-board safety regulations surrounding the securing of his dog for take off and landing. “Our policy makes it clear that dogs must wear a standard identying jacket or harness which is provided by the owner, which must be attached to the owners seat belt via the use of an extension seat belt in order to provide an effective level of restraint. “The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always easyJets highest priority.” "},{"url":null,"title":"incredible bravery story sas legend","story":"NewsPrince Harrys touching tribute to incredible act of SAS bravery during elite units finest hourEXCLUSIVE: SAS Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba fought during the Battle of Mirbat in Oman, widely considered the finest hour of the SASShareCommentsByJulie McCaffrey:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPrince Harry and Fijis President Jioji Konrote pose in front of a new statue commemorating Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba, a British-Fijian soldier who lost his le in the  Battle of Mirbat \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailProud is a word Roger Cole doesn’t use often.

Really proud. Quite overwhelmed, actually. “This man who was always smiling, always positive even in the worst sshyituations. And he was very steely – he easily coped with everything. He deserves more recognition than he got. “Hopefully, having the world’s cameras on Laba’s statue means more people will appreciate what he did. Because within my memories of him smiling and sadness at losing him, it’s always irked me that he didn’t get the Victoria Cross.”  In  the SAS was secretly stationed in Oman to bolster Britain’s ally the Sultan and protect Arabian oil fields from communist guerrillas, trained by Russia and China, called the Adoo. As part of Operation Jaguar, their first mission was to win the hearts and minds of locals in Mirbat, a small coastal town. Roger, then a -year-old lance corporal, says: “None of the locals knew anything about the outside world so they were very taken aback to see us. “We were medics who helped give their babies medicine and set up football teams for the kids. Laba had a really special way with children.”  At .am on July , the day the men were due to fly home, Roger was sleeping at the house they were based in when he was woken up by a fellow shysoldier. Roger recalls: “He said, ‘I think we’re being attacked’. And I said, ‘bugger off’. Then I heard ‘boom boom boom’, looked out and saw bombs landing all over the place.” Roger got dressed and manned a machine gun as the enemy advanced to a nearby fort on the town’s outskirts. He says: “We’d immaculately trained for this. Laba ran  yards under fierce fire towards the gun pit outside the fort.” Thick mist cut visibility to  yards and when Roger saw  figures through the gloom, he “knocked them down”. But waves of enemies, armed with Kalashnikovs, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars, kept advancing.  Roger says: “With swirling mist, and enemy constantly coming up from trenches, I felt asI was in a World War One film. Around  minute s later the radio crackled with a message from Laba, ‘I’ve been hit. I’m still OK’. He was horrendously injured, yet carried on firing, knowingthe Adoo got hold of that gun we were all f***ed.” The gun, normally fired at long-range, was being used like a rle as the enemy were so close to the barbed wire perimeter of the gun pit. Sgt Sekonaia “Tak” Takavesi, a fellow Fijian, ran to Laba’s aid in another feat of bravery which the SAS also believes is deserving of a Victoria Cross. Roger says: “One hundred and fty guys were shooting at him from  yards, bullets and grenades were bouncing off the ground. “Tak ran like a rugby player, ducking, dodging and weaving to get to his line. And he made it. I still can barely believe what I saw.” Tak found Laba wounded to his chin. And while Tak was himself shot in the back and shoulder, he leaned against sandbags and kept firing. At .am the -pounder gun fell silent.  Commanding officer Captain Mike Kealy, aged only , decided to run to the gun pit and trooper Tommy Tobin volunteered to go with him. Mike ordered a mortar to be fired close to the gun pit. “It could have gone seriously wrong and wiped out our own men,” says Roger. “But it worked - it frightened the enemy back.” Mike and Tommy reached the pit and found Laba had been shot in the throat. A message came across the radio to Roger: “Laba is dead.” Tommy’s jaw was also blown off and he died later back in Britain. “It didn’t sink in at first,” admits Roger. “Adrenaline is so high, focus fully on the task ahead, there’s no time for emotion.“ Yet even at the height of battle, Roger spent time treating local casualties. A helicopter arrived to help, but came under fire and had to turn back. Then as the fighting raged, a radio message told Roger two jets were on their way. “They asked, ‘How many enemy ’ I replied, ‘A f*****g lot’.” The planes fired rockets and machine guns, and dropped lb bombs. One was damaged and left the battle. The other ran out of ammunition. Roger says: “When I got back on the roof with Corporal Bob Bennett, we saw a large troop marching towards us. We looked at each other and said, ‘Bloody hell’. It was our Zulu moment. “I knew this could be our last half hour. I had  rounds left. Bob had ten. “And that’s when pictures of my we Pauline and daughter Natasha, only nine months old, came into my mind. I would never let the enemy take me alive – I would’ve shot myself with my last bullet.” The sound of helicopters eventually broke through the gunfire. A -men back-up SAS team arrived and the Adoo started to flee. Roger says: “Years later, when I was writing my book, I spoke to someone on the other side. He told us we fought off  men that day.” The choppers were loaded with dead bodies and casualties. Roger continues: “I saw Tak walking to the helicopter to make sure Tommy got inside, even though he had four bullet holes in him.” The battle was won. Yet silence surrounded their victory. Roger adds: “I wanted to say, ‘We have just won a war’. Yet no one knows a thing about it. All of the Mirbat survivors are still good friends – almost family. “We have a bond that can’t be broken, and that gave us strength. The only thing we want is to see Laba properly shyrecognised. Prince William unveiled a statue in the SAS camp at Hereford, but the public can’t see that. “Prince Harry immediately said he’d unveil Laba’s new statue in Fiji. “He knows Laba is an SAS legend. Maybe now we can get our government to realise the same thing and give him the posthumous Victoria Cross.”SAS Operation Storm: Nine Men Against Four Hundred by Roger Cole and Richard Belfield, published in paperback by Hodder  Stoughton pound.."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harry joined","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry joined by David and Romeo Beckham as they attend final day of Invictus GamesThe Duchess wore a power suit for the wheelchair basketball event, arrived to cheering crowds in Sydney as they took their seatsShareCommentsByRussell MyersAbigail OLeary:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video prince-harry-meghan-arrive-invictus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Prince Harry are rounding off the last day of their Australia Royal Tour at the Invictus Games in Sydney - with the Duchess getting a cheeky kiss on the cheek.The Duke and Duchess are attending the wheelchair basketball event, where they were joined by David Beckham and his son, Romeo.

The royal couple were being shown around a market on the Pacic island of Tonga yesterday and noticed the item straight away. Eco groups suggest it is against sustainability practices that support healthy oceans to harvest or take away items such as black coral, Triton trumpet shells and turtle shells. The Duke and Duchess politely turned down the offer of a gt from the vendor they had been chatting to with royal sources, confirming they were both aware of the nature of the item. Strict Australian import laws would not allow them to bring the item back eventhey had wanted to accept it. Salome Tesi, who was stationed at the first stall the royals came to in the market, said the couple had been interested to see a display of tree-like black coral on the table but politely declined to take away a carved necklace in the shape of a turtle.  “They asked about where it came from,” she said. “We offered them a necklace as a gt and they said they liked it. “They really liked it but they didn’t take it. I think they wanted to take a look around all of the market.” So far, the Duke and Duchess have been given a number of unusual gts during their tour, including carrots, UGG boots and a roast pig. One of their first gts on tour just happened to also be their first baby gt - a cuddly toy kangaroo.  The Duke and Duchess were also presented with a wide-brimmed Akubra hat, popularised by Hollywood classic Crocodile Dundee.

Meghan Markles wedding dress and a replica of Prince Harrys unorm go on display at their wedding venue today, and will remain there for the public to view until January  before being moved to Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. Speaking on a multimedia guide given to visitors on their tour of the castle, Meghan and Harry spoke for the very first time about how they chose music, flowers and even the brides tiara. Meghan revealed a lovely little gesture Harry made on the morning of their wedding which added a very personal touch to their nuptials. The bouquet was comprised of flowers that we really love, she said.  But they didnt just really on an expensive florist to provide the arrangements. Harry got involved, too, with a romantic gesture. We have a very small garden here that we had been planting things in the Fall for and what was really special, I think, was that the morning of the wedding Harry went in and he picked some flowers to go into my bouquet, which was really beautul and something that makes it sentimental and really meaningful. Harry adds: We didn’t have as many flowers in our little garden as we had hoped for because I think it snowed at Easter!The Duchess laughs and says: Thats true!Harry then confirmed that the bouquet included a tribute to his late mother, Princess Diana.  He continues: That kind of ruined the whole thing! But, they’re very much a bouquet of wild flower, wild flower meadows and making sure that we had forget-me-nots in as it was one of my mother’s favourite flowers. The great thing is that the day after the bouquet ended up at Westminster Abbey on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier as, again, very traditional rather than throwing it over your head, I think it was the perfect place for it to be laid at rest.  Meghan and Harry married in a fairytale wedding in St Georges Chapel, Windsor Castle, on May . On display at the exhibition are Meghans dress, designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, and her veil - which included  embroidered flowers representing countries of the Commonwealth. Prince Harrys Frockcoat unorm and George and Charlottes page boy outfit and bridesmaid dress are also on display.

When confronted by the Mirror, he said: “You’ve come a long way. Thank you but I can’t say anything” Green, facing calls to be stripped of his knighthood, flew to the state in his poundmillion Gulfsteam jet. He owns a pound.million home there. He played tennis for  minutes, but only got one set in between phone calls as the #MeToo scandal swirled around him. The Mirror confronted the shamed tycoon amid the fallout of him being outed in Parliament trying to gag a newspaper. When askedhis accusers were making their claims up, he replied: “I can’t say anything for legal reasons.” He then sped off in his luxury golf cart.  Green, , is facing calls to drop his injunction preventing reporting of a string of gagging orders signed by former staff, who allege he bullied and sexually and racially harassed them. Three months after he launched a pound, legal bid to silence the , Green insisted: “I categorically and wholly deny these allegations”. Sweltering in C heat, Green wiped sweat from his brow as he lunged for the ball against a man in his s. The billionaire, a keen tennis player, owns a pound.million bolt hole a stone’s throw from the courts, which are in the grounds of the Canyon Ranch Wellness Resort. It is thought he also flew there in the wake of the BHS scandal in . A source said: “Whenever troubled has flared, he has been known to head to Tucson, leaving behind his place in Monaco or his yachts.”  Meanwhile, the Mirror unearthed a picture of the Topshop boss with his arm around the waist of a young woman in little more than lingerie and angel wings. The Las Vegas photo reveals the tycoon in a frilly shirt fancy dress outfit unbuttoned to the waist, before his name was dragged into a string of scandals. It was allegedly taken in the Bellagio Hotel on Halloween in . An onlooker told the Mirror: “It was early evening when I saw Sir Philip leaving the Bellagio with two young women. “It was Halloween and everyone dresses up in America, so it seemed normal. He was clearly off to a shy and got into a car. “There was no sign of Lady Green. He was holding this woman close and clearly enjoying himself.” Before we tracked him down, the Mirror spotted the tycoon’s poundmillion jet parked discreetly at Tucson International Airport in Arizona. Green was seen talking on his mobile as he strolled in the US state.  A source said: “It’s no secret, Phil’s love of Arizona. He gushes about the place. It allows him to escape the stresses of his business. The Gulfstream GER had left Las Vegas on Sunday destined for the Arizona city, but as it was making its approach it erted to Los Angeles.

A year later it fell apart with , job losses and a poundmillion pension black hole. Yesterday the #MeToo scandal continued to swirl around Green, with a hashtag of pinknotgreen swept social media. It called for a boycott of Green’s shops, including Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton. On Thursday, former Labour minister Peter Hain told the House of Lords it was his “duty” to name Green due to the “serious and repeated” nature of allegations.  He told Parliament he had “been contacted by someone intimately involved in the case of a powerful businessman using non-disclosure agreements and substantial payments to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying.” A barrister claimed Lord Hain’s conduct was “completely improper”. The peer said it was “the right thing to do”. Parliamentary privilege protects MPs or peers from being prosecuted over statements made in the Commons or Lords. Green said after Lord Hain named him: “I am not commenting on anything that has happened in court or was said in Parliament today. “To the extent that it is suggested I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations. “These settlements are confidential so I cannot comment further.” Thespent eight months investigating accusations against the tycoon. But on Tuesday it was prevented from revealing the existence of non-disclosure deals by a interim injunction issued by the Court of Appeal. Women and Equalities Select Committee chair Maria Miller, who has called for reform of such deals, suggested it was time to “consider whether NDAs are actually outlawed”.

The company has come under fire for not throwing David Mesher off the plane after he called widow Delsie Gayle an ugly black b*******. In a statement issued today, Ryanair claims it immediately reported the footage to police. But this has been questioned by the man who recorded the shocking tirade. Despite admitting cabin crew were shown the video after landing at Stansted, Ryanair claimed it immediately shared the footage with police two days later on Sunday morning. David Lawrence, , from Kent, was the passenger who took the video on the flight before it took off from Barcelona.  They are talking rubbish, he said. Their statement is making a lot of people confused - it doesnt make sense. Mr Lawrence said he showed the footage to flight attendants at the end of the flight on October , as well as to Ryanair staff at the front desk. The airline issued the statement in an effort to dispel  claims that it did not respond quickly. It said Ryanair only became aware of this video late on Saturday, before reporting it to Essex Police at am on Sunday.  This came after the footage spread widely on social media, and they came under much criticism for failing to eject the passenger from flight FR before take-off. The airline has not responded to repeated requests for comment on why staff did not raise the video with police after the flight. Ryanairs statement came as David Mesher, of Birmingham, publicly apologised for the first time over his treatment of Ms Gayle, while he denied being a racist. But Ms Gayle and her daughter, Carol Gayle, rejected the apology over the language used.  Askedshe accepts the apology, Delsie Gayle said: I dont think so. You must forget and forgive but its going to take a long time for me to get over what he has done to me. Her daughter added: He says he wasnt racist - he wouldnt be saying words like thathe wasnt racist. The airlines communications chief Robin Kiely apologised over the regrettable and unacceptable remarks. We believe that by reporting this matter immediately to Essex Police and by apologising in writing to this customer early on Sunday morning, Ryanair treated it with the urgency and seriousness it warranted, he added. Officers from West Midlands Police assisted Essex Police, who are leading the investigation, by speaking to Mr Mesher in his sheltered accommodation in Yardley Wood on Thursday. The incident took place on the tarmac of Barcelona Airport before the plane departed for Stansted, so UK police have said officers will pass the investigation to Spanish authorities.

Iraq got bombed back to the Stone Age. North Korea was invited to tea. Into the void where the Axis of Evil once terried the world, a new existential threat to civilisation has been born. And it has a spire  metres tall. Unbeknown to the , tourists who visit it each year, it seems that Salisbury Cathedral is built on an inter-dimensional whirlpool which sucks evil down towards hell like sand in an hour-glass. The presence of these unwitting pilgrims, walking widdershins around the cloisters, merely speeds up the spiritual centruge.Hence the bemusement of Russian spies who, on an entirely-heterosexual visit under  names to the East End of London, found themselves dragged towards the bewitching building. They broke free of its unearthly tractor beam only when they dropped a bottle of perfume that Ruslan had bought as a gt for his mother, and was unfortunately past its sell-by date.Caught in the Salisbury swirl, the liquid mutated into a battlefield nerve agent with unforeseen deadly consequences when it was dropped on the doorstep of a building that happened to be home to a Russian defector. They didnt get to see the spire. Which is a shame, because theyd heard it was the tallest in Britain.  The vortex is felt across the world. It drew a team of  assassins from Riyadh to Istanbul, where CCTV was disabled when an unfortunate journalist tripped and fell over a discarded bone saw, several times, and then cut off his own face and thew it down a well. It also compelled his accidental murderers to flee before the Turkish authorities could persuade them to headbutt a bullet, develop a sexual attraction to mincers, or perhaps most suicidally of all, announce they were taking up careers as journalists.The evil eddy even forced an otherwise-gentle and liberal soul entirely in tune with st century social norms to scream UGLY BLACK B******! at a Windrush migrant.The more cynical corners of the internet have whispered that Ryanair flights are the twisted children of Salisburys malevolent maelstrom, producing miniaturised tides of despair and misery, but the companys official ouija board insists in the face of all the evidence that it is just a coincidence.  Now it appears Salisburys undertow to the underworld has drawn someone all the way into the cathedral itself, there to smash two holes in the specially-toughened glass box in which lies one of only  remaining original copies of the Magna Carta.At time of writing no-one has been charged in relation to the Get Carta incident, but there are three madcap theories of who could be responsible:. A grammarist insistent on adding the definite article to the documents customary description, becausethe is written on the bloody thing people cant not use it . The ruler of a nation in political crisis who wants to add a th clause stating Brexit means Brexit on the basisthey didnt know what it meant in the th century she cannot be blamed for making it up as she goes along in the st . Nicholas Cage on one of his many flights of fancy, trying to crack a hidden medieval code that links the Founding Fathers to Jesus secret lovechild, whose ultimate descendant turns out to be Indiana Jones dad.  Of course, thats all ridiculous, isnt it  As mad as finding someone in Old Sarum wants planning permission for an underground shark tank, or that Kim Jong Un has moved his embassy to Middle Wallop. Or genuinely thinking that because both Porton Down and a village called Palestine are in the vicinity, Salisbury must be on speed-dial to the Devil himself. There are no forces of evil. Salisbury is no more be a wormhole to the netherworld than it is a coral atoll in the South Pacic. Whoever tried to steal the Magna Carta was too dumb to realise it was alarmed, it would disentegrate within  minutes and would be harder to sell on than Philip Greens used undercrackers. Evil is a supernatural force which means some people are born beyond redemption - destined for corruption and amorality, and liablecaught to be crucied, electried, poisoned or shot because theyre something other than human. But evil is just an excuse.Humans are merely bad. They make bad decisions and do bad things, making bad excuses along the way. Vladimir Putin ordered the elaborately-dficult murder of Sergei Skripal because he thought the defector was evil, and evil deserves the effort. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia ordered the elaborately-messy murder of Jamal Kashoggi for the same reason. And people like the Ryanair racist arent evil, either. Theyre angry, ignorant, unsocialised outcasts, often sick and usually screaming at the world for not being nicer to them. When we say something is evil we refuse to take responsibility. We say it was out of our hands when the Twin Towers fell or the policeman was kned or the terrorists got through. We dont say: How did we make that terrorist  Why dont we spend money on people who do bad stuff  What has to change before we accept that guy other there goes to the toilet just like I do Whoever tried to steal the Magna Carta, whoever is sending bombs to Donald Trumps enemies, whoever strokes Tommy Robinsons cancerous ego is not evil. Theyre us, with a few things gone wrong. A lost job, a last straw, a loose wire.If we stop saying its evil -we stop saying maybe thats just Salisbury for you - we might be able to fix it. You dont solve problems with an excuse.

The picture, obtained by the Mirror and taken in Las Vegas, reveals the billionaire in his pomp before his name was dragged into a string of scandals. As we today tracked down Green to Arizona, there were demands for the tycoon to be stripped of his knighthood. He is facing calls to drop his injunction preventing reporting of a string of gagging orders signed by former staff, who allege he bullied and sexually and racially harassed them. Three months after he launched a pound, legal bid to silence the , Green issued a statement this week in which he insisted: “I categorically and wholly deny these allegations”.  The Las Vegas photograph shows Green wearing one of his much-loved fancy dress outfits, a frilly shirt unbuttoned to the waist, with the unidentied young woman at his side. It was allegedly taken in the Bellagio Hotel on Halloween in . An onlooker told the Mirror: “It was early evening when I saw Sir Philip leaving the Bellagio with two young women. “It was Halloween and everyone dresses up in America, so it seemed normal. He was clearly off to aand got into a car. “There was no sign of Lady Green. He was holding this woman close and clearly enjoying himself.”  Tonight Green appeared to be lying low after being named in Parliament as the businessman behind the injunction. The Mirror spotted the Topshop tycoon’s poundmillion private jet parked discreetly at Tucson International Airport in Arizona. Green was seen talking on his mobile as he strolled in the US state.A source said: “It’s no secret Phil’s love of Arizona. He gushes about the place.  “It has year-round sun and allows him to escape the stresses of his business. “Whenever troubled has flared before he has been known to head to Tucson, leaving behind his place in Monaco or his yachts.Normally where ever his Gulfstream is, Phil is not far away.” The Gulfstream GER had left Las Vegas on Sunday destined for the Arizona city, but as it was making its approach it erted to Los Angeles.  Little more than  hours later, at .am on Monday, it left LAX to make the -minute journey to Tucson. Green’s aircraft is described as the “holy grail of private jets”. It can fly non-stop from Hong Kong to New York. It was delivered in , weeks before the Green family’s Lionheart superyacht arrived.The vessel is understood to have cost poundmillion. Green, often snapped with A-listers such as the late Dirty Dancing actor Patrick Swayze, has a transport collection that also includes a speedboat, a helicopter and other yachts.  He is a regular in Tucson, where he visits the Canyon Ranch wellness resort at the foot of Santa Catalina Mountains. It thought he used the retreat during the BHS scandal. In  he sold the chain to investors with no retail experience. A year later it went to the wall with , job losses and a poundmillion pension fund black hole. Meanwhile the #MeToo scandal continued to swirl around Green today. A hashtag of pinknotgreen swept across social media, with calls for a boycott of Green’s shops, including Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton.On Thursday, ex-Labour minister Peter Hain told the House of Lords he felt it was his “duty” to name Green due to the “serious and repeated” nature of allegations. He told Parliament he had “been contacted by someone intimately involved in the case of a powerful businessman using non-disclosure agreements and substantial payments to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying”. A barrister claimed Lord Hain’s conduct was “completely improper”, but the peer said it was “the right thing to do”. He later told BBC Newsnight: “I considered it extremely seriously before I said it. I’m discharging myas a parliamentarian, and what concerned me about this case was wealth, and power that comes with it, and abuse.”  Parliamentary privilege protects MPs or peers from being prosecuted over statements made in the Commons or Lords. Green said after Lord Hain named him: “I am not commenting on anything that has happened in court or was said in Parliament today. “To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations. “These settlements are confidential so I cannot comment further on them.” Thespent eight months investigating accusations against the tycoon. But on Tuesday the newspaper was prevented from revealing the existence of non-disclosure deals by a interim injunction issued by the Court of Appeal. Women and Equalities Select Committee chair Maria Miller, who has called for reform of such deals, today suggested it was time to “consider whether NDAs are actually outlawed”. She added: “Unfortunately they’ve become so misused that some feel they can do anything as long as they can afford to pay for the victims’ silence, and that is no way for our legal system to work.” "},{"url":null,"title":"student 20 blinded two hours","story":"NewsStudent, , blinded for two hours after  eyelashes are stuck on with NAIL GLUEUniversity of Bedfordshire student Megan Rixson urged her social media followers to be \"very, very careful\" where they get their eyelashes doneShareCommentsByJamie MunnKelly-Ann Mills:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video student-temporarily-loses-sight-after-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA student claims she was unable to see for two hours after her eyelids were glued shut when she had  lashes put on.

Edward Farmer, from Leicestershire, had been taking part in an Agricultural Society initiation event in December , where he had up to  shots of vodka in less than three hours. The -year-old, a Newcastle University Fresher, died due to the toxic effects of an excessive amount of alcohol in a short period of time, according to an inquest. Edwards death sent shockwaves through the university, which has now banned initiation ceremonies, reports ChronicleLive . The ceremonies are often carried out when freshers join a new society and usually involve drinking large quantities of alcohol. At Newcastle University, most students ChronicleLive approached had heard about the Mr Farmers death, and have seen stories about the inquest over recent days. All agree that it is shocking - one calls the story terrying.  One man said his flatmate is a member of the Agricultural Society, the group which organised the initiation which ended in Mr Farmers death. Theyve all been warned about it, he said. Music student Holly Clarke said it had been a shock to hear about the tragedy, which didnt line up with her experience at university at all. I honestly thought it was an American thing that happened in frat houses there, or maybe at Oxbridge - it doesnt seem like something that would have happened here, she said. I havent experienced anything like it. Its terrying that something like that could happen. Drink and death with students, it feels completely unheard of, and the fact that it was through an initiation process worries me. I think part of it is that with new students theres this idea that youve got to go out and get drunk, thats part of the culture, and thats not just Newcastle. People are being inserted into a new environment, they want to fit in and make friends and the way they do that is by drinking - freshers are socially expected to drink a lot. Newcastle University officially bans initiations to its student societies. The university website warns anyone found to have organised or participated in an initiation ritual will be subject to disciplinary action, saying the events encourage excessive drinking, force humiliating and degrading behavior, and may bring the institution into disrepute.  Speaking at the inquest, however, Lesley Braiden, academic registrar at Newcastle University, said it was dficult,not impossible, to monitor initiation events. The group of lads who met with the Chronicle, who admit to having some experience of initiations, therefore ask to remain anonymous. Now studying for masters degrees, most of them completed their undergraduate at Newcastle, when several of them participated in the events as freshers. However, they said they dont recognise some of the more shocking challenges mentioned in Mr Farmers inquest - apple bobbing in urine or drinking from a pigs head - and they dont think the initiations are a more general problem for the university. One man said: A lot of sport societies have initiations, a lot of first years get excessively drunk and do silly challenges. What happened is awful - when someone gets to that stage thats when you stop and make sure theyre alright. But the way its being portrayed makes it sound like its a problem with our student culture in general. Its being made into a bit of a witch-hunt against Newcastle and societies. You cant say its completely safe, but when students take part, theyre  and they choose to do it. You might be egged on but youre not forced to drink. The group listed the activities theyd think of as being involved in initiations, saying it is mostly drinking games, and some times tasting unpleasant non-alcoholic things. Youd pour spirits into a football boot and drink them, or do shots of something thats a bit disgusting, one said. When asked about the university ban on initiations, the students were only vaguely aware of it.  A third man said: You get emails, but I dont think anybody is really going to listen to it - theyd just call them something . While these students admitted to having experienced initiations, and one witness at Mr Farmers inquest said they were widespread, most of those wandering around campus who agreed to speak said it was not something theyd come across. Fourth year chemical engineering student Jono Morley said: I havent experienced anything like that. I think its just sports teams, although Ive got friends on sports teams whove never done anything like that. He agreed there was a culture of heavy drinking more generally, but not more so than in other universities or cities. I would say most students here are the same as at any other university: its just students being students. For third year psychology student Charlotte White, this drinking culture felt alienating as a fresher - so she started up the Newcastle University Sober Socials society. Teetotal Charlotte was keen to take part in activities which didnt centre around drinking, but found most of the activities organised by university clubs seemed to involve going out. She founded the society, now in its second year, for drinkers and non-drinkers alike who wanted a club whose social activities didnt focus on boozing. The really friendly group go out for coffee, bowling, or host sober film nights. I tried to find societies I could feel comfortable in but a lot of them would only offer club nights, she said. In Freshers Week they do put on some non-drinking events but after that its just sort of expected thatyou want to socialise you go out drinking.  People are expected even before they go to uni to drink a lot as freshers - family members would say to me oh, Newcastle, theres great night le there so theres a sense you have to take advantage of that. There can be a pressure to drink: a lot of friends have come to me and said I wish I could say no but they feel likethey want to go and make friends they have to pretend they are really up for it. The -year-old, who is also studying drinking culture in universities as part of her academic work, says that pressure can also extend to the amount drunk: theres a sense that students should not just drink, but get drunk. People say oh, Ill come out for one but friends say have another, Ill buy you one, evenyoure trying to control it and be sensible it doesnt happen. Theyre trying to make sure everyone has fun, but that means drinking. Newcastle University registrar, Dr John Hogan, said: Ed’s death was a great tragedy which shocked us all and we would once again like to express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. Initiations are banned at Newcastle University and it is made clear to all clubs and societies that any such events constitute serious misconduct.  Since Ed’s death we have already made a number of changes to the way we raise awareness among our students about the risks of alcohol and how they keep themselves and their fellow students safe. However, having listened to the evidence we will be reflecting carefully on all that we have learnt at the inquest and looking at whether there are areas where we can improve what we do. Over the last four days we have been shocked to hear some of the details of what took place that night and do not condone this sort of behaviour in any way. Following our disciplinary investigations a number of students were found to be in breach of University rules and appropriate inidual sanctions were imposed. The Students’ Union also took action against the society involved. The welfare and safety of all our students are of paramount importance to us and together with the Students’ Union we work hard to help them stay safe during their time at university. On behalf of the University, I would once again like to express to Ed’s family and loved ones our deepest sorrow about the loss of a young man of such potential who surely had a bright future ahead of him.

The -year-old, who is accused of sending pipe bombs to critics of President Donald Trump, warned the power company it would be worse than September th, according to a  police report. His extensive rap sheet also includes arrests for domestic violence, theft and fraud. Sayoc, a former stripper, showed flashes of violent anger and posted vitriolic screeds online. In recent months, Sayoc, a registered Republican, railed against Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on Facebook.  He also posted venomous broadsides against George Soros on Twitter, posting one tweet on Wednesday, two days after he allegedly mailed a bomb to the liberal philanthropists home. Hours after he was arrested in Plantation, Florida, on Friday, his social media posts and peripatetic work history began to offer the first sketch of a man whose rudimentary bombs launched a nationwide manhunt. Sayoc has been charged by the FBI after  explosives were sent to top Democrats including the Clintons and Obamas. He is accused of five federal crimes, the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions confirmed tonight during a press conference. He faces up to  years in prisonfound guilty.  Sayocs white van, which was seized by authorities, had numerous pro-Trump stickers featuring the President and Vice President Mike Pence, as well as a CNN SUCKS sign. The van also had photos of Clinton and other Democrats with bullseyes superimposed on their faces.  David Cypkin, , a documentary filmmaker, recalled seeing the van parked outside a shopping center near his home for more than a year and as recently as this summer. It often had an open door or an open window, which led me believe there was somebody inside, Cypkin said in a phone interview. It stayed overnight. I saw it dozens of times.  Sayocs social media accounts are filled with anti-Democrat sentiments and racist diatribes. Two Twitter accounts that appear to belong to Sayoc are largely made up of retweeted posts condemning prominent Democrats, including Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for Florida governor, and Soros. Two weeks ago, Sayoc threatened a former Democratic congressional spokeswoman on Twitter after her appearance on Fox News. The tweet warned her to hug your loved ones real close every time you leave home.  The woman, Rochelle Ritchie, reported him to Twitter, but the company found he had not violated any conduct rules. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment, citing an ongoing law enforcement investigation. A Facebook profile that appeared to belong to Sayoc featured videos and photos of him at multiple Trump rallies, including at least one in Florida. Several posts contained anti-Muslim statements.  Sayoc attended Bred College in North Carolina and the University of North Carolina in Charlotte and played soccer for both schools, though he did not graduate either one, according to school representatives. From  to , he worked as a male exotic dancer for Gold Productions Inc, according to a company employee. Sayoc left to pursue a professional wrestling career and later started his own company. He is a promoter, booking agent and live entertainment owner, according to his LinkedIn profile. He filed for bankruptcy in Miami in , according to court records. At the time, Sayoc said he lived with his mother and had recently left a store manager job that paid less than , a year. He listed a , tax refund and a  Chevy Tahoe vehicle as his only assets.  His LinkedIn page said he was pursuing veterinary medicine at High Point University in North Carolina, but a school spokesman said he did not attend the school. One of his Twitter accounts said he worked at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel  Casino in Florida, but the Seminole Tribe of Florida, which owns the casino, said it could find no evidence to confirm that.  FBI director, Christopher Wray, announced that  explosive devices had been sent to iniduals. Sayocs fingerprints were found on a package sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters, Wray said. And he didnt rule out there being other packages. But he added: We do believe weve got the right guy. The FBI tweeted: The FBI can confirm we have one person in custody. There will be a press conference in Washington DC at the Department of Justice at :pm ET.  The explosive devices were sent to top Democrats, former senior US officials and prominent critics of President Donald Trump. Trump this afternoon praised the FBI for finding the suspect and compared it to a needle in a haystack job. He said: I am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody. Its an incredible job by law enforcement. These terrorising acts are despicable and have no place in our country. And we will prosecute them, him, her, whoever it may be to the fullest extent of the law. He went on to say how Americans must uny and show the world they are united in peace and harmony. It comes as police found two suspicious packages earlier today addressed to US Senator Cory Booker and James Clapper, the former US director of national intelligence.  All the people targeted have often been maligned by right-wing critics. They included Democratic Party donor George Soros, former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, and former Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has said that at least five of the packages bore aaddress from the Florida office of US Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a former chair of the Democratic National Committee. There has been an outcry from Trumps critics, who claimed that his inflammatory rhetoric against Democrats and the press has created a climate for politically motivated violence.  After first calling for unity and civil discourse on Wednesday, Trump lashed out again Thursday at the hateful media. His supporters accused Democrats of unfairly suggesting the president was to blame for the bomb scare. Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, its just not Presidential! Trump said on Twitter.  Authorities believe the packages, which were intercepted before reaching their intended recipients, all went through the US Postal Service at some point, a source said. None detonated and no one has been hurt. The devices were thought to have been fashioned from bomb-making designs widely available on the internet, a federal law enforcement source told Reuters. Still, investigators are treating the devices as live explosives, not a hoax, said James ONeill, the New York City police commissioner.

Body modication fanatic Paulina Casillas Landeros, from Jalisco, Mexico, underwent numerous surgeries such as a back corset - which involves piercings on either side of the spine - and a split tongue. She later decided to remove her belly button as it is what makes us human before giving it as a present to her then boyfriend Daniel Ramirez, in . But following the removal three years ago, she says she ultimately regrets her decision describing it as reckless and impulsive.  The HR intern and tourism student said: I have always had problems with my family, I was not very close to them at the time. Body modications fascinated me, there is something very transcending about them. I was very angry, I wanted to cut all unions from everything and everyone. I wanted to dehumanise myself in a symbolic way, I wanted to do something controversial. I underwent an operation done by a professional but he gave me very bad advice on how to take care of the trauma so it got infected. I was suffering, I spent days in bed asI were quarantined, I couldn’t stretch, push, stand up or laugh. It gradually healed itself but not  per cent - it will never close entirely.  Paulina said she knew she wanted to give the body part to Daniel as an ultimate token of love. She said: I was very much in love with my then boyfriend, he supported me through many dficult times, and he is one of the most influential people in my le. It was something I did in the spur of the moment, we were young and stupid but that’s the way I felt. I put it in a small bag along with a note saying I love you, it was very emotional. He has kept it and he will keep it forever because he knows the meaning behind it. We are good friends now but we will always love each other.  Paulina says her relationship with her family has now improved. I do regret it when I put myself in my mum’s position, it must have been devastating for her, she was so sad, she said. I can’t imagine how it must feel, your own child wanting to break all their connection to you. If I could go back in time, I wouldn’t do it again, it was impulsive, reckless and I hurt a lot of people. Even though I did it for the wrong reasons, it has now taught me I should think things through before acting and it’s a nice reminder that characterises me.

Lupin and their children came up with the wonderful idea of musical instruments for the cabin.“They’re just absolutely fantastic, they’re loved by every family who come to the cabin.“It’s one of the first things that kids run to when they come into the garden.“Everybody is drawn to them and it’s a lelong tribute to the support of Donald and Apache.”Lupin said it was “very emotional” for her to visit the cabin for the first time but said their kids wished their dad could have been there to see it.She added: “Donald would have been so proud of what he has helped them to achieve.“It was heartbreaking and heartwarming in equal measure.“Donald was a born leader, he was brilliant.“He was very bright and very capable and could just do everything.“He would have been very proud of it and very touched by it and he would have wanted to support them more.“I really want people who donated to know the dference Callum’s Cabin is making.”"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen groups urged to apply for 2500 funding","story":"Aberdeen community groups have been urged to apply for up to £, of funding.The deadline for applications to Aberdeen City Health Improvement Fund will close next month on November .Delivered in partnership with NHS Grampian, Aberdeen City Council and the Aberdeen City Health and Social Care Partnership, the fund is available to initiatives that improve health and wellbeing in Aberdeen.Open to anyone living or working in Aberdeen, the money is available to iniduals, staff or community groups , voluntary or non-profit organisations.Successful applications from last year included a sheltered housing complex in Parkhill Court and a miscarriage support service set up by Abi Clark from Blackburn in .

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain. Irvine#s Kyles team-mate Roddy MacDonald has also been selected and there are places for Oban Camanachd duo Lorne Dickie and Andrew MacCuish.The Scottish mantra in recent games has been to keep the ball on the ground and to use the wide open spaces to stretch the Irish defence and not allow the hurlers to build up a head of steam with their aerial game.Caberfeidh’s dead-ball expert Kevin Bartlett will again be key and he scored twelve of Scotland’s eighteen points a year ago.There are no rule changes as such this year but there will be an Irish referee, John Keane, which brings its own dimension.Garry Reid added: #The interpretation of the rules will be key. In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game. However there’s no doubt this will make for a fast pace as it will let the game flow and that’s important for the international to remain a spectacle for the supporters.#Scotland squad:Stuart MacDonald Glen MacKintosh The match, which starts at pm, will not be broadcast live this year but the match will be shown in full on BBC ALBA from pm on Saturday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mum gets ready for a new year dooking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowShe hates the water and is none too fond of the cold, but one Mid Argyll mother plans to throw herself into the icy sea on New Year#s Day.Joan Williamson is taking part in the traditional Loony Dook at South Queensferry for a cause close to her heart.When her twin daughters Star and Angel were born two months premature at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary after an emergency Caesarean section, mum and babies were in a bad way.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

And Peter Goudie, , came face to face with officers, including armed police, who were twitchy that his Volkswagen Golf was in the way.  Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car. He added: “His we was furious when she found out as it cost pound to get the car back the following day. “He was in the dog house for his stupidity.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEd SheeranVolkswagenJusticePrestwickDonald TrumpAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire vets reveal cases sedated","story":"NewsAyrshire vets reveal cases of \"sedated\" and \"drowsy\" dogs on our beachesWidespread reports of dogs falling ill have sparked panic among pet owners in the region.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsAyr beach \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVets have been inundated with sick dogs on Ayrshires coastline, the Post can reveal.

about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"decision-soon-on-the-quay-plans","story":"Amanda Chisholm, the independent reporter appointed to determine the appeal on behalf of Scottish Ministers, carried out an inspection of the site at Fisherrow Harbour last month.Lodged by Simply Musselburgh Care Limited, the appeal followed East Lothian Councilrsquos refusal of a plan to convert the former leisure complex, restaurant andsuites into a -bed nursing home.Ms Chisholm is now preparing her decision, a copy of which will be sent to all parties involved and published on the Planning and Environmental Appeals Divisionrsquos website.A meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee in June regarding The Quay, owned by Dr Charan Gill, ended with a near-unanimous decision to reject the nursing home proposal.Only Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning committee convener, backed council officialsrsquo recommendation to approve the plan.Local groups including Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Area Partnership, and Musselburgh Conservation Society, among others, are calling for the appeal to be thrown out., Musselburgh Area Partnership, Fisherrow Harbour and Seafront Association, and the Musselburgh Business Partnership are calling for the appeal to be thrown out."},{"url":null,"title":"teachers-time-in-turkey-inspires-her-debut-novel","story":"Set in the Turkish capital Istanbul, Dr Margaret Halliday chose the location for her book as she worked as a teacher in the country for seven years.She decided to take up writing seriously five years ago when she was unable to live the same lestyle because of multiple sclerosis .An avid writer of diaries throughout her le, during which she saw the world, she planned to expand them into short stories when she retired.Dr Halliday, , who lives near Fisherrow, said: ldquoIrsquom excited about my first novel being published.ldquoAfter writing three memoirs, I wanted to try fiction as I had completed an Open University creative writing course.ldquoTaking the advice, lsquoyou should write about what you know,rsquo I chose Turkey for the setting as I worked there for seven years.The Belly Dancer is a tragicomic romantic thriller set mainly in Istanbul in the early s.Gemma, a young English woman, finds herself involved in more than just teaching English soon after her arrival in Turkey.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much. They are actually meeting up and having their version of a ceilidh!"},{"url":null,"title":"pass-the-parcel-over-new-railway-station-for-east-linton","story":"A campaign has been ongoing for nearly two decades, with the earliest opening of the station thought to be .However, fears have repeatedly been raised that the timeline could change, with the opening of the station, along with one at Reston in the Scottish Borders, slipping further down the line.Transport Scotland has stressed the plans remain ldquoon schedule and the commitment to the scheme is ldquounwavering.Tom Thorburn, chairman of Rail Action Group East of Scotland , aired his frustrations at RAGESrsquo AGM last month.He said: ldquoWe have been campaigning for these stations to open for nearly  years.ldquoWe have been shunted from one Transport Minister to another with delaying tactics from each so that no firm decision is taken when our new stations will happen.Various discussions have taken place with a succession of Transport Ministers since , when Stewart Stevenson MSP, according to Mr Thorburn, confirmed that a second Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidancewould not be required as the case for the Edinburgh to Berwick local service with a re-opened station at East Linton was so strong.However, since then, progress has been slow, with still no date confirmed for when work could begin on the station.Already, East Lothian Council has agreed to put forward more than pound million for the station, with Scottish Borders Council doing similar for the station at Reston.The new East Linton station would not be on the site of the former station there, which closed in , and instead would be to the west.Mr Thorburn said: ldquoThere is now a sixth Transport Minister, Michael Matheson, and when I tried to make an appointment to see him, his staff said his diary was full.ldquoWe have no way of knowing when our stations will happen ndash will it be by  or will they drop off Network Railrsquos agenda altogether ldquoIt seems that it is a lsquopass the parcelrsquo exercise from one minister to the next and East Linton and Reston stations are not seen as a high priority project by the Scottish Government.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said: ldquoIt was agreed by the Scottish Government and East Lothian Council that East Linton station will be delivered during the next railway investment periodas part of a larger programme of works to enhance the East Coast Main Line.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses. Goose Green is another area remote from a bus route.A Tesco spokesperson said: ldquoWe have made the dficult decision to stop the provision of the T and T bus services to and from our Musselburgh Extra store.ldquoUnfortunately the services make a loss, which means we are no longer able to provide them.ldquoWe have worked with local bus providers to ensure that all affected areas will continue to have a bus link that connects them to our store, including a newly introduced  bus from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird.ldquoOur priority now is to ensure our customers who use the bus are aware of our decision and of all these alternative routes so that they are able to plan their journeys.ldquoWe apologise for any inconvenience this causes.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoEast Lothian Council was notied of Tescorsquos intention to withdraw the T and T services in September and we are fully aware of the impact this may have on the local community.

Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey, and Tasmania also immediately followed suit.Three weeks later in the UK, an Act of Parliamentdecreed that, for a certain period during the year, the official time should be one hour in advance of GMT. The United States followed in .Between  and the Second World War, the clocks were put forward by one hour in the UK in spring.During the Second World War, British double summer timewas temporarily introduced.

Backbench MPs tried to change BST, but the The Daylight Saving Bill - failed in the House of Commons.Over the years, the effectiveness of DST has been the topic of much debate. Supporters say it reduces traffic accidents in winter, saves energy, boosts tourism and encourages people to spend more time outdoors. Critics claim darker mornings are dangerous for children walking to school.In , a YouGov poll found  per cent of Brits supported keeping clocks forward permanently, while  per cent were against.Most parts of North America and Europe, plus some areas in the Middle East observe DST.

Mrs Barbourrsquos army went toe-to-toe with bailfrsquos officers trying to evict their neighbours and finally marched on the sherf court to support tenants being prosecuted for non-payment of the rent increases.David Lloyd George was forced to intervene as Munitions Minister and the Rent Restrictions Act was passed within a month, a piece of legislation that inspired similar movements across the world. If some of the unelected executives in Glasgow City currently pulling down six-figure salaries had had their way Mary Barbour and her women would probably still be fighting this battle.On Tuesday and Wednesday , women staged a strike and marched for the equal wages and the payment of a decade of back money to which their entitlement is now enshrined in law. A few streets away stuntmen in black sports cars and motorcycles were filming the latest in the Fast and Furious movie franchise, Hobbs and Shaw. In Glasgowrsquos city chambers the response by officials both elected and unelected could be described as aw and naw.The leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken, tried to pat the women on the head while suggesting that they didnrsquot really know why they were striking. To be fair to Ms Aitken, she inherited this situation following a decade when the ruling Labour administration spent pound.m fighting the claims of more than , mainly female public sector workers to have pay parity with their male colleagues. Such wretched conduct was characteristic of Labour in Scotland as it gradually lost the hearts and minds of its core support. Ms Aitken made the task of ending this dispute a primary manesto commitment in  and few doubt her desire or sincerity. Yet, at times during this dispute it seems that she, an elected official, is being undermined by those who have been wielding real power in Glasgowrsquos city chambers for far too long.Certainly, there can be no doubt that the issues genesis and its consequences lie at the door of successive Labour administrations and this rendered the messages of support from Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard hollow. A wiser course for Mr Leonard and the Pavlov Dogs in his party to have adopted would have been simply to have acknowledged Labourrsquos faults and pledged to support all sides in reaching a just settlement.Yet, the SNP must also watch its step. It has spent  years at the task of taking Glasgow from Labour and has been able to occupy most of the moral high ground in this dispute. Some of the partyrsquos rhetoric and tactics in the course of these febrile last few weeks, though, has been questionable. Whoever spun the line that the proposed two-day strike would put the health and lives of vulnerable people at risk obviously knows little about the issues at the heart of the dispute. Council executives were also given three weeksrsquo notice to make alternative arrangements.These are troubles those who inhabit George Squarersquos executive suite will never encounter. Their remuneration packages along with all others at the council who earn more than poundk rose from  earning collectively pound,, in   to  who got pound,, in  , according to the Investigative Journalism Unit, The Ferret.Ms OrsquoDonnell herself earned pound, in  , an increase of more than poundk in one year. When this dispute has been settled, Ms Aitkenrsquos next task must be to hold these unelected executives to account. Their high-handed and arrogant attitude has probably cost the city tens of millions and led to increased hardship for thousands of claimants and their families. The elected leader of Glasgow City Council needs to show these people that she is the real boss.She could start by asking why her chief executive missed  previous meetings to negotiate with trade unions before finally getting involved by threatening to deploy Thatcherite anti-trade union laws. The threatening letter about secondary strike action sent to the unions sent by Carole Forrest, the councilrsquos director of governance on Tuesday night was a serious error of judgment. It risked escalating the dispute at a time when both sides were already beginning to release some air from the situation. It also betrayed ignorance of how trade unionism has shaped this cityrsquos industrial history. Few Glasgow citizens have been left untouched by the kindness and hard work of these women over many decades. Many of us will eventually come to rely on their gentleness when it is our time for the soup and tartan blankets. We also have a near-sacred tradition of not crossing picket lines in a just dispute.Scotlandrsquos First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted her support of the Glasgow women but said the withdrawal of their labour was unnecessary. She was wrong, for this was a most necessary strike and a reminder that such actions still have a place in an industrial landscape that remains grossly unequal."},{"url":null,"title":"swinney-at-centre-of-perfect-storm-over-pay-for-teachers-and-lecturers","story":"Being derailed by the perfect storm of industrial action over pay in both school and

table for both sectors are the most affordable possible and also deliver on a number of other priorities.The minister said an extra pound million for teachers on top of the three per cent pay rise for all staff, and annual progression, would see all teachers on the main grade scale receiving at least a five per cent increase - with some getting up to  per cent to help recruitment and retention.By seeking to contact teachers directly to inform them of the detail of the deal Mr Swinney clearly believes classroom staff will see the offer as beneficial, regardless of what their unions are telling

Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Saturday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmThis weekend is destined to be spooktacular, whatever the weather.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority. We will continue to work closely with Scottish Government, other agencies and industry at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years. Mr Robertson said: \"We were particularly glad to have a representative of the Inkson family with us, in the form of J.K.rsquos daughter, Helen, and we were pleased to hear a message of greeting from his son, Kerr, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\"Kerr wrote of his pride in the job his father had done, developing and managing the exchanges. He also wished us all a happy evening together. We remembered with fondness, all those who were no longer with us, and especially J.K.Inkson himself, to whose memory all drank a fitting toast.\"Warm thanks were also expressed to Sandra Collard who helped maintain contacts and organise the event and Marie-Anny who \"emulated mdash and surpassed mdash her fictional compatriot, Monsieur Poirot, in locating so many of our Belgian friends\".Although Marie-Anny was the only surviving Belgian veteran who felt able to undertake the long journey to Ross-shire, Mr Robertson said: \"There has been a great exchange of email addresses, and it looks like the ether will be buzzing with electronic correspondence between old friends in Britain and Belgium.\"Well done, Marie-Anny and Sandra, for giving us one of the most memorable days of our lives, and thank you Alistair, for your magical photographic memories of this wonderful occasion!\"Saturday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Saturday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In addition, with two performance improvement plans in force, poor punctuality that has caused misery for commuters should have been turned round and be firmly on an upward trajectory. But none of that has happened.Only around ten of  brand new electric trains are in service, such as on the main Edinburgh-Glasgow line. The first should have been introduced more than a year ago, but they have been delayed by series of problems including to their windscreens and brakes, and setbacks to the electrication of the route.The introduction of the other fleet, of -year-old diesels for longer-distance inter-city routes, has been equally problematic. The first of the  trains did not enter service until a week ago, some eight months late, after refurbishment of the carriages was severely delayed. Problems even included the wrong type of thread being used in their new carpets.: Alastair Dalton: How to find hidden cheaper rail faresThat will mean most of the first ten trains, which are due to be operating by December, having to carry passengers in an unrefurbished state. “Classic” is the official description.A year ago, just as ScotRail was showing off the first of the trains north of the Border, one of its former stablemates still at Great Western Railway in England caught fire.Two weeks ago, another of the trains broke down on ScotRail’s inaugural preview run from Aberdeen to Edinburgh.On top of all this, the ScotRail Alliance’s train punctuality, which has struggled for two years, has further noseed.: Alastair Dalton: Roadtesting ScotRail’s new train reveals many changesWhile officials stressed the impact of last month’s Storm Ali on bringing down the latest figures, there has been a malaise for months despite improvement plans being implemented in autumn  and April this year.I’m told an increasing proportion of the delays are caused by track and signalling faults which are the responsibility of Network Rail, rather than ScotRail’s trains breaking down.However, this is causing bad blood between the two bodies, which are supposedly working closer than ever before, because Network Rail is being “named” when things go wrong.In the old days, they diplomatically referred to each other as “our industry partners”.I hear transport secretary Michael Matheson this week voiced impatience at the lack of improvement. However, the SNP mantra that fuller control of Network Rail by Scotland would solve the problem has been rubbished by many in the industry.The pressure is on, and the next big test will come in December when the alliance attempts to add a raft of extra trains, such as a new Edinburgh-Glasgow service via Cumbernauld.It will seek to avoid a repeat of the enduring chaos down south this year when several train operators launched over-ambitious bigger timetables onto a network that couldn’t cope.Building the best railway Scotland has ever had is still very much a work in progress – and on current form, it may well remain that for quite some time to come.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820680.1540587643!/image/image.jpg","title":"stephen jardine food standards agency scaring people out of business","story":"The Food Standards Agency#s approach to safety is over-zealous # in contrast to the common sense attitude in France, argues Stephen Jardine.In a dining room in Aberdeen, the staff of a Government quango are gathered for their annual Christmas lunch. The starter is clear soup. Well it’s actually water ... but not just any old water – it’s been boiled and puried. That’s followed by turkey, served pretty much incinerated after eight hours at  degrees. There is no pudding again this year after the notorious incident with the sixpence and don’t even think about asking for cheese.If that approach to food seems joyless and uncompromising, spare a thought for cheesemaker Tricia Bey. This week she announced her Barwheys Dairy is to close and the finger of blame is being very firmly pointed at an overzealous Food Standards Scotland, based in Aberdeen.Ten years after starting production in an attempt to revive traditional cheesemaking in Ayrshire, Tricia has simply had enough. She took to social media to announce she has stopped production and will close her dairy this year, blaming rising costs and over-regulation of the industry.: Stephen Jardine: I just had one of my worst meals out everShe said: “Increasingly invasive and onerous inspection and testing regimes have taken all the joy out of our previously happy enterprise.”She believes responsibility for this lies with Food Standards Scotland which has also been in a long-running wrangle with another producer, Errington Cheese. The organisation denies having a vendetta against artisan producers but there is growing concern about the way it goes about its business.Stringent food hygiene standards are not something to be taken lightly. Earlier this month two children died in an E-coli outbreak in Leicestershire and public health officials are still trying to identy the cause. Whatever can be sensibly done to limit the risk of food leading to sickness and illness should be done but what is sensible when it comes to limiting risk  So many things can go wrong. A chef might not wash their hands properly, a kne might not have been adequately cleaned, a bug may still be on a lettuce leaf and soil residue on the skin of a potato. To eliminate all potential causes of problems is practically impossible but it seems that is what Food Standards Scotland is on a mission to do.: Stephen Jardine: Is the Michelin guide biased against Scottish food Faced with some of the big issues affecting salmon farms or the repeated instances of mislabelling in the meat industry, small artisan producers with limited resources are an easy target in comparison. What is proportionate has been lost in the clamour to send out some kind of message.There is another way. I lived in Paris for two years where most cheese shops would struggle to satisfy food hygiene regulators here. However artisan production flourished because regulation there was built on common sense and a proportionate approach to risk by inspectors and consumers. Here a heavy-handed approach based on regulation rather than cooperation is sending a shiver through small-scale food production. Food Standards Scotland will say they are simply making our country a safer place for us to live and eat. Butthe way they are doing it is literally scaring people like Tricia Bey out of business, then something is going very wrong in the way the organisation conducts its affairs.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820711.1540588712!/image/image.jpg","title":"new drive to win backing for assisted dying law in scotland","story":"Assisted dying campaigners claim there is now #empathy and understanding# among MSPs about the need to introduce the controversial measure in Scotland.Supporters are preparing to step up activities in the coming months, with a keynote screening of the groundbreakingdocumentary How to Die in Oregon being staged in Edinburgh next week to help raise awareness.But opponents warned that there is no groundswell of support for such a move and say a lack of safeguards in the US state has prompted concerns that vulnerable people are being pressurised to end their lives prematurely.The Scottish Parliament has twice rejected plans to introduce assisted dying in Scotland over the past decade, but campaigners insist flaws in the previous legislation were the problem and the measure has overwhelming public support.A cross-party group at Holyrood has been established to look at the prospect of a fresh attempt to introduceassisted dying. Legislation appears unlikely in the current parliament, but campaigners are poised to launch a renewed drive in the new yearto win over the public and politicians.Heather McQueen founded Dignity in Dying Edinburgh group after watching her mother suffer a “cruel and “inhumane” death two years ago. She is behind the documentary screening being held by the group at St Augustine’s on Monday evening as part of an awareness-raisingpush to dispel the myths. Ms McQueen says lack of understanding surrounding assisted dying means that people are “frightened” by the process.She added: “Having seen this film it’s touching, it’sharrowing, but it’s actually quite re-assuring. I know this sounds strange but there are some really nice deaths there.“And having seen a not nice death, I think it would be good for people to realise that that’s what this can allow.”The award-winning documentary takes a fly-on-the wall style approach to severalcases in the US state where assisted dying has been legal for the past  years. It has won a number of awards and featured at the Sundance Film Festival.The late Margo MacDonald spearheaded two attempts to introduce assisted suicide legislation. it was defeated by  votes to  at Holyrood in . Five years, later, following Mrs MacDonald’s death from Parkinson’s disease in , it was again rejected. But this time support increased to  MSPs backing it, albeit opposition remained stable at .Ms McQueen’s described the previous attempts at passing legislation in Scotland as “half-cocked”. “There were ious problems with the way it has been discussed before,” she said.“One of the main problems I think is that it went forward as an Assisted Suicide Bill. But this is quite definitely not assisted suicide. “These are people who are dying. That’s what we want to change, who we want the choice for.“So in no way are we talking about introducing a bill to legalise suicide, that’s not the same thing at all.”Polling conducted by Dignity in Dying indicates that  per cent of the voting public in Scotland are in favour of assisted dying.“Had they actually considered an idea with more safeguards built in, I don not think we would have had the outcome wehad,” Ms McQueen went on.“Having spoken to some MSPs, although they’re unwilling to commit and don’twant to say anything they’re going to be quoted on, I’m actually detecting a lot of empathy and a lot of understanding thatthis does actually need to change.”But Dr Gordon Macdonald, Senior Policy Officer with CARE for Scotland said there was “no evidence” of a sht in opinion among MSPs on the issue.He said: “The public when presented with the main arguments opposed to assisted suicide show that there is no overwhelming support for that proposal. “Rather support for assisted suicide falls dramatically [to less than  per cent] when the public get the opportunity to hear the main argument against it, that it would put vulnerable people at risk. For these reasons MSPs should reject any new efforts to change the law in this area.”He pointed to “year on year increases” in the number of people committing suicide with state assistance where it is legal. “In Switzerland, the number of assisted suicides has increased by over , per cent in the same period with alarming levels of assisted suicide tourism now occurring,”he added.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820721.1540586418!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish labour told to get off the fence on second eu referendum","story":"Scottish Labour must “get off the fence” over a second referendum on EU membership, one of the leading campaigners for a so-called People’s Vote will say in Edinburgh today.Lord Adonis, the former education minister, will call on all Scottish MPs to back a public vote on the terms of the UK’s Brexit deal to honour the Remain vote across Scotland in .His comments come as rts have emerged in the SNP over the party’s strengthening \u2028support for a second EU referendum, with one MP saying\u2028 a People’s Vote “won’t happen”.Addressing an event in Edinburgh, Lord Adonis will say: “Scotland’s MPs will be critical in the fight for a People’s Vote.“Scotland voted overwhelmingly to Remain, so the Scottish Labour Party must get off the fence and back a People’s Vote.“The vast majority of Labour Party supporters in Scotland want one, and they do not want their only pro-EU option to be the SNP.”Lord Adonis will be joined by Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray, who will challenge Scottish Conservatives to “put the country before the Tory Party”.“Tory leader Ruth Davidson backed Remain and it’s time she told her Scottish MPs to stop acting as Lobby fodder for the Brexiteers, and get behind a People’s Vote,” Mr Murray said.“She can’t claim to support the Union while putting it at risk with a hard Brexit.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us.

I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that.

This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Saturday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8680982.1540388113!/image/image.jpg","title":"london support sought for 20 000 jobs blueprint","story":"A delegation from an area rocked by the loss of more than , highly paid manufacturing jobs in recent years is currently in Westminster with a blueprint to revitalise its economy.Business leaders, politicians and council officials from Mid and East Antrim are telling the UK Government of their ambitious plans to deliver economic growth through the proposed £bn Belfast Region City Deal.The substantial economic opportunity includes plans for around £m of investment in Mid and East Antrim, which has suffered signicant job losses with the closures of Michelin and JTI Gallaher in Ballymena.This includes proposals to extend The Gobbins clf path, Islandmagee, the regeneration of Carrickfergus and the creation of an innovation and inspiration centre at the St Patrick’s site in Ballymena.Anne Donaghy, council chief executive, said: “As a council, we are fully committed to supporting business growth and development, and promoting an environment that encourages and facilitates investment in our borough.“We focus our efforts on being an enabler to the wealth creators.

Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels. They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain. “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.“A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8670196.1539680805!/image/image.jpg","title":"council rolls out 2018 enterprise week activities","story":"With this year#s Enterprise Week rolling out from November  to , businesses and entrepreneurs across the borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon are being urged to be part of this enterprising initiative.Spearheaded by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council and sponsored by Bank of Ireland, the week-long programme will see a range of inspirational and informative events take place across the borough, demonstrating council’s commitment to nurturing and developing the local economy.

We will have state of the art facilities, this will be a top rate training facility for local clubs and schools. Our kids deserve this. There will be high-tech lighting that will illuminate the pitch but won’t effect the houses near by.“It’s vital that local kids get full use of this facility, we want it filled to capacity every day with schools, we envisage coaches training kids here, Gaelic clubs, soccer clubs, after-schools activities and outdoor gym classes. I believe this will transform the community.”Work is due to begin in December andall goes according to plan it should be completed by the end of March.Cllr Baker said the investment by Belfast City Council is a big boost for the community. “This area suffered badly under Lisburn Council and we are delighted now that this huge investment has come into the area. We have a population of just under , people here and they deserve nothing but first class facilities and that’s what we are delivering.“As a father and a member of the community here I would love nothing better than on a Sunday morning having a blitz here, rather than going to other parts of Belfast. I’m very excited about the future.”Sinn Féin MLA Órlaithí Flynn added: “I welcome the investment coming into the Lagmore area and commend the great work that has been done by our local Councillor in securing improvements to the White Rise pitch. The youth in this area and the wider Lagmore community will reap the benefits of important enhancements such as this.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/stevie.png","title":"new cemetery needed for belfast","story":"AN all-party Cemeteries and Crematorium Development working group that was formed a year ago to tackle the ongoing issues around burial costs and cemetery maintenance and development, say they feel that Belfast graveyards and cemeteries need a radical overhaul to keep up with demand.The Council group, who meet on a monthly basis have been tasked with finding solutions and coming up with ideas for Belfast’s cemeteries.Councillor Stevie Corr is the Sinn Féin representative on the working group.“The idea of a new cemetery for West and North Belfast has been discussed for well over a decade now and has yet to come into fruition,” he said.“The City Cemetery for all intents and purposes is full, Milltown has limited availability as well, St Joseph’s cemetery in Hannahstown is only available to parishioners. New graves are only available in Blaris cemetery when someone dies, the days of pre-planning your funeral or purchasing multiple graves are gone, we are almost at crisis point with our cemeteries.”Last year Lisburn and Castlereagh Council was tendered for a new cemetery, however the tender was unsuccessful.Cllr Corr said: “Because of boundary changes people in the Colin area are no longer Lisburn Council meaning they will have to pay more to be buried in Blaris because that cemetery  crematorium is no longer in their jurisdiction.“This is reaching crisis point, we need to have a radical approach, review and rethink around the issue of burials, cremations and cemetery spaces. We can’t wait until the day somebody is refused burial because there is no space.”With that in mind Belfast City Council have come up with the new cemeteries working group to look at these issues and to also come up with ideas around the development of our cemeteries.Cllr Corr said: “I am the party representative on the group and we are coming up with some excellent plans. For example, a new multi-million pound upgrade will be going into Roselawn crematorium.“We still need a new cemetery for North and West Belfast, it’s a very sensitive subject.“Our cemeteries are also in a position where they can become historical and tourist attractions. Look at Tom Hartley’s cemetery tours, they tell the tale of our city, from rich tombs and headstones to poor grounds where thousands of our poor are buried.“Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin is one of the main tourist attractions on the island of Ireland, it went from being a crime hotspot to being a place of beauty and interest, because it tells the tale of the formative years around the formation of the Irish Free State – our cemeteries are no dferent.“There have been books written about the City Cemetery and Milltown Cemetery.”Cllr Corr continued: “Clton Street Graveyard contains the graves of some historically signicant families, including the Dunvilles, the Sinclairs and Henry Joy McCracken, one of the leading United Irishmen. It was closed to public access approximately  years ago due to anti-social behavior. This has now decreased and the local area of Henry Place has been re-generated and a new business hub has been formed. The graveyard remains locked due to concern regarding the safety of some of the monuments. There are currently regular requests for access from tourists and visitors with a genealogical or historical interest in the graveyard.“Our social, political, economic and religious history are in our cemeteries and we need to have them as places we can use for education.“Take for example the City Cemetery heritage project, we want to bring tourists, academics and school children in as well as the local community.Our cemeteries are at their safest when people are in them, Tom Hartley’s tours have proved that.“The purpose of this working group is to give an extra edge and focus while giving the issues of graves, cemeteries and monuments the attention they deserve.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newington boss crossan demands swift improvement","story":"Steel and Sons Cup quarter-finalSt James’ Swts vNewington Donegal Celtic ParkNEWINGTON manager, Conor Crossan has demanded an improved showing from his side as they continue the defence of their Steel and Sons Cup title with a quarter-final away trip to St James’ Swts on Saturday. The North Belfast side suffered a - home defeat to Lurgan Celtic earlier this month as they lost ground to Championship  league leaders Annagh United. Last Saturday, they bowed out of the Intermediate Cup following a - penalty shoot-out defeat at Maiden City after the game finished - after  minutes. Crossan feels Saturday’s game is the perfect opportunity for his side to rediscover their form in a competition that is close to their hearts. “We are looking forward to Saturday, hopefully we can get back to winning ways,” said Crossan.“The boys know that the performances haven’t been good enough over the last couple of weeks. “We want to stay in as many cup competitions as we can because of the way the league is structured. “It was a poor result and a poor performance against Lurgan Celtic and we had a few players out last Saturday, but it was sore getting beat on penalties.“You always want to be going into the big games on the back of a win and our form of the last two weeks hasn’t been good. “We are going into this match against a team that has won  from  so they’ll be full of confidence. It will be up to me to get the team up for this game.” As defending champions, Newington will be the favourites to progress, especially considering they play in a higher league. Yet, the progress made by St James’ Swts hasn’t gone unnoticed in the north of the city and Crossan is refusing to underestimate the challenge posed by the Swts at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday. “People might underestimate the Ballymena League, but you have some great teams in that league – the likes of Bangor and Coagh and teams who were in Championship  in recent years,” added the Newington boss. “They are playing at a good level and they have players who have experience of playing in the Irish League. “They’ll be full of confidence and I don’t think they lost too much sleep when they drew us.“They are the type of team who relish the challenge no matter who they face. “They’ve been making noise for a while now.“They will want to build on that start and keep going, but hopefully we can put a stop to that winning run on Saturday.” St James’ Swts assistant manager Dan Murphy, meanwhile, insists the club is “buzzing” ahead of Saturday’s eagerly-anticipated clash with the defending Steel and Sons Cup champions. The West Belfast side have made an incredible start to the   season and have won all  of their game so far. The only stain on an otherwise perfect start came when they lost the points following their - win over last year’s Ballymena and Provincial League winners Glebe after it emerged one of their players should have been serving a suspension arising from a ban with his previous club. St James’ are aiming to go a step further than they managed in last season’s competition when they bowed out after losing - to Linfield Swts in the last eight.  “The whole club is buzzing, we know how big this competition is. We got to this stage last year and we lost out to Linfield Swts,” said Murphy. “We were - down and we gave a penalty away and went - down. “We got a goal back and we threw everything at them to get an equaliser and we make a silly mistakes and they broke and made it -. “It was a bit gut-wrenching. We wanted to go on further in the competition and we are just hoping to go one step further this year and make it into the semi-finals.” Last season, the Swts challenged for promotion from the Ballymena and Provincial League Premier Division, but fell short at the end of a busy campaign. This season, they are, strictly speaking, unbeaten on the pitch and Murphy feels that is in no small part because of the summer signings made by manager Damien McStravick. “Last year, we knew we had a good team and we were playing good football,” said Murphy. “Towards the end of the season, it was just injuries and suspensions that killed us.“Our squad was a bit light and a few boys had to play with knocks. “During the summer, we made some brilliant signings thanks to Damien McStravick. He met boys who had played at a higher level and sold them on the ethos of the club. “We ended up with a smashing squad. “We kept all the players we had last year and we’ve added a bit more quality to it. “The new boys have all bought into what the club is about and they are enjoying their football.” This Saturday, St James’ bid to continue their incredible start to the season by dumping the holders out of the Steel and Sons Cup. However, Murphy is expecting a tough battle from the North Belfast side given that Newington went on to defeat Linfield Swts in last year’s Christmas Day final at Seaview. “They are a very dogged team and they work hard for each other. They are able to take their chances when they get them,” added the St James’ Swts assistant. “We also know they are the champions of this competition and they’re no going to let go of it easily. “We played them in pre-season and we won that game -, but they signed well after that game. “We know we are going to be up against it and it will be a real test. “We have to be at our best, but the way we are playing, I thinkwe show up on the day, we can win the game.” Newington will be without the suspended duo of Gavin Taggart and Kevin Bradley for Saturday’s clash while St James’ Swts are set to be at full strength for the quarter-final tie."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sf%e2%80%88asked to take","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw has called for the removal of the election-style anti-Brexit posters erected by Sinn Féin in parts of the constituency.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China.

Mr Paisley is asked to detail whether or not the discussion had taken place,anyone was present at the time, and \"what was said by you and by Minister Bell and the outcome of the discussion,any\". In his response, Mr Paisley dismisses any suggestion Mr Bell had discussed a possible Nolan Show appearance with him, but gives a candid account of a phone call he had with him in early December. Saying he had known the former Enterprise Minister \"since university days\", Mr Paisley says he spoke to Mr Bell between December  and December  by telephone, in Parliament Buildings and at Mr Bells home. \"He was quite troubled and concerned about his future because of the RHI scheme and appeared that he wanted a shoulder to cry but he did not reveal to me any plan to speak publicly in the way he subsequently did,\" Mr Paisley said in his evidence. \"The discussion from memory was rambling and long it was over a late night cup of tea, I vaguely recall one of his children being there for part of the discussion so the conversation was quite casual.\"Mr Paisley said he listened to his DUP colleague \"out of interest and at times amusement\" as Mr Bell \"outpoured his incredible view of his place in the Government\". He says that Mr Bell spoke about possibly taking legal action, and quoted Ian Paisleys father - the late Ian Paisley, founder of the DUP - and \"reminisced heavily\" about a Bible verse he felt was appropriate. \"It was a long and bizarre and rambling conversation,\" said Mr Paisley. \"He spent time slagging off Nigel Dodds, Gregory Campbell, Maurice Morrow and most other people in the DUP leaving me to thinkI wasnt there he would be slagging me off to whoever cared to listen. \"He then had a number of grievances which appeared equally bizarre against Timothy Johnston, John Robinson, Andrew Crawford and Timothy Cairns who he claimed all had their hand in the RHI scandal and that some were making vast amounts of money out of it and that he had a map that proved where all of the schemes had opened up during the critical period all of which happened to be in the back yard area of Timothy Johnston and John Robinson. Mr Paisley described the scenario as \"quite sad\" but said the two \"parted on good terms\".He recalled: \"I was aware I had just met Walter Mitty in the flesh and I believe Jonathan Bell believed he had met someone who would support his assertions.

The DUP are isolationists and on the wrong side of the argument and the democratic will of the people.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

While the potatoes are cooking, whizz the salmon, ginger and lime zest in a food processor until they form a thick paste.. Peel the outer layer of the lemongrass and discard. Cut the stem in half ways and chop as finely as you are able. Add to the salmon paste, then add the salmon mixture to the cooled potato, combining well. Divide the mixture into eight and shape into patties.. Dip each one into the breadcrumbs to coat and put onto a large plate or baking tray. Chill in the fridge for at least an hour to firm up the fishcakes.. Place a large, heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Heat the sesame oil and butter together in the pan until beginning to foam, then fry the fish cakes in batches, until golden on both sides.. To make the dipping sauce, combine all the ingredients and pour into a small serving dish.

David Sterling yesterday ed to the RHI Inquiry for his fourth day of evidence The inquiry’s  days of evidence have been devastating for the reputation of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, exposing failures across the organisation and a culture in which civil servants acquiesced in breaking their own rules in order to please Stormont ministers.On the inquiry’s penultimate day of evidence, Mr Sterling said: “I have to admit that multiple mistakes, multiple failings were made and that we should have done better.“As permanent secretary in the Department of Finance, when I attended the Public Accounts Committee two years ago I offered an apology on behalf of my time at the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment.“But I think it’s only right as head of the service I should recognise that the extent of the failings have been such that I should offer again, without hesitation, a profound and unequivocal apology for the mistakes that have been made.“And I want to take this opportunity to make a promise on behalf of the NICS board that we will do everything possible to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again.”Mr Sterling also gave a personal assurance that any action recommended by the inquiry would be implemented “quickly and fairly”.Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin interjected to sharply remind Stormont’s top mandarin that he would have to deal with “the fact that this is not the first time” that these mistakes or omissions have happened, with a series of damning Audit Office reports having previously exposed some of the practices which led to the RHI scandal, including the failure to keep records and a refusal to believe whistle-blowers.After outlining past failures to deliver on assurances that “lessons have been learnt”, Sir Patrick told Mr Sterling: “So we do need to be convinced that third time round something’s going to be effective.”Mr Sterling said he agreed and acknowledged that there had been a repeat of behaviour from past scandals which ought to have ended, and went on to set out a series of bureaucratic steps which he said had been taken or were being worked on in an attempt to prevent a recurrence.However, he acknowledged that past reports commented not on an absence of rules but on a culture where those rules were not adhered to – something he said had to change.He endorsed the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General that civil servants should treat public money asit was their own.Mankilled in NI road traffic collision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"However, he insisted that the public should not view every civil servant through the prism of RHI, highlighting that thousands of civil servants work with diligence and integrity – and have done so in particularly trying circumstances for more than a year and a half in the absence of any form of ministerial direction.Mr Sterling went on to give a second apology to civil servants for the fact that he had played a role in the scandal – in that he was the most senior official in Arlene Foster’s department at the time when the scheme was set up without cost controls.Although Mr Sterling was not personally responsible for drawing up the scheme, he accepted responsibility as the most senior civil servant within the department at the time of that key failure.He said that as someone involved in the scheme he wanted to “offer an apology to the rest of the civil service who no doubt are having to deal with the fact that the credibility of the organisation as a whole has been called into question – unfairly in my view”.However, Mr Sterling accepted some people will question what they are hearing: “I can understand that people may be cynical or sceptical about what I am saying – but I would want to give you assurance that we are very serious about this.”try catch     .               ..

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £.

On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
