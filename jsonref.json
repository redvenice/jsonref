How is this ‘natural’? Stop photoshopping, you’re beautiful without it.’Someone else said: ‘Learn to edit your pics properly you look disfigured!!!!’But over all of the negative comments, there were people who stuck up for Lauren, as her bud Pascal Craymer said: ‘SERIOUSLY give it up on the photoshop comments, If you have nothing nice to say be quiet!’To which Lauren replied: ‘I take it as a compliment. looool’This isn’t the first time the reality star has been called out over editing her photos.Just last week her eagle-eyed followers spotted another picture that might have been tampered with as some thought the mirror looked wonky.In the snap she can be seen doing leg lifts at a gym as she showed off some swanky fitness gear.She captioned the piece: ‘Today’s workout with @glam_physiques and I absolutely love it wearing my @so.monroe fitness gear #bodytraining #core #balance #weights #dead #sweat #strength #strong.’However, fans weren’t falling for it and suggested that she’d tweaked some of the shots for a slimmer waist.Towie recap: Gatsby\u0027s caught in a storm while Dean and Amber go on a dateWho is Towie\u0027s Liam \u0027Gatsby\u0027 Blackwell - age, net worth and familySomeone wrote: ‘Ummmm.

He admitted he didn’t contact the Federal Trade Commission.The billionaire appeared to cope well with the pressure of questioning (Picture: Reuters)Zuck said that he first learned about the British firm’s activities in 2015 and did take action, taking down an app and ‘demanding’ the developer and Cambridge Analytica delete the data.‘It was a mistake to believe them, we should have followed up,’ he said.‘We considered the case closed.’When asked about Russian interference in the elections, the Facebook CEO said: ‘This is an arms race, they are going to keep getting better at this. We need to get better too.’Zuckerberg also vowed that his social network would always be free of charge in some capacity, but did not totally rule out the possibility of a paid option to remove adverts.‘There will always be a version of Facebook which is free,’ he continued.When asked how the social network’s business model allowed people to use it without paying, he responded: ‘We run adverts.’The billionaire was also probed about whether Facebook had a monopoly.‘It doesn’t feel that way to me,’ he replied to laughter.Zuck’s tremendous work ethic was obvious as he continually put off breaks and opted to crack on with the interrogation (Photo: AP)The hearing went on for almost two hours before Zuckerberg was offered a break in the questioning.‘Shall we do 15 more minutes?’ he asked.‘Does that work?’Zuck then powered on before trying to work through another break, joking: ‘That went well.’He seemed most nervous when asked if his site had a left-wing bias and censored right-wing pages, but insisted Facebook was ‘a platform for all ideas’.One of the panel wanted to know if Facebook was committed to remaining neutral rather than ‘putting your thumb on the scales’.Zuck insisted the social network did not impose a political ideology.‘In general thats our position,’ he continued. ‘In order to create a service where everyone has a voice you need to make sure people aren’t bullied, intimated or that the environment feels unsafe for them.‘Our goal is to allow people to have as much expression as possible.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_6775973.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"nobody believes gateshead councils smoke screen denial 5g street lights","story":"Not everyone is convinced (Picture: GettyFacebook)Get your tin foil hats on, people.

(Picture: North News)The statement sparked an overwhelming response on social media with not everyone convinced the council were telling the truth.‘Stop lying,’ Ben Travis wrote, posting a link to several articles about the supposed link between street lighting and cancer. ‘If you want to believe the anonymous bureaucrat crack on. I prefer to do my own research instead of eating the bullsh*t they feed us.’Valerie Cranston wrote: ‘Gateshead Council definitely have something to hide… If they haven’t, then under the Freedom Of Information Act release the proof that is causing concerns.

Trump has agreed to meet Kim for a historic US-North Korean summit as soon as next month, but Pyongyang has never officially confirmed its offer of denuclearization talksAs officials in Washington scrambled to prepare for the prospective meeting, the weeks-long silence had reportedly made the White House nervous that Seoul had overstated the North\u0027s willingness to negotiate over its own nuclear arsenal.Kim\u0027s remarks on Monday break that public silence, although he did not specifically refer to a \u0027summit\u0027 with Trump.Following multiple media reports of back-channel talks between the Cold War rivals, Trump said on Monday he planned to meet Kim in \u0027May or early June.\u0027\u0027I think there will be great respect paid by both parties and hopefully there will be a deal on denuking,\u0027 Trump said.\u0027Hopefully it will be a relationship that will be much different than it has been for many, many years.\u0027Trump says he\u0027ll meet with Kim Jong un in May or early June...North Korea tells the U.S. it is prepared to discuss...Share this articleNorth Korea\u0027s recent surge in diplomatic activity marks a stunning turnaround after a year of heightened tensions which saw the North fire multiple missiles and carry out its most powerful nuclear test, further isolating the regime and triggering a fiery war of words with Trump.Since sending a high-profile delegation along with athletes to the Winter Games in the South in February, Kim has made his international debut with a visit to Beijing, his first overseas trip since taking power in 2011.The North\u0027s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho arrived in Moscow on Monday after making stops in Beijing, Azerbaijan and other former Soviet republics.Ri also paid a visit last month to Sweden, which acts as a diplomatic go-between for Washington and Pyongyang.          At the meeting of party officials Monday, Kim discussed the \u0027development of the north-south relations at present and the prospect of the DPRK-US dialogue\u0027If the summit does take place, many remain skeptical about the whether a meeting between the two notoriously unpredictable leaders can succeed.It is scheduled to take place without the months of groundwork that usually precedes such meetings.No specifics have yet emerged concerning the date or venue of the proposed summit, with a third country such as Mongolia or Sweden under consideration to host the talks, according to multiple reports.Beyond that, a detailed agenda for the talks will need to be set.Washington\u0027s long-held stance is that it will not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea. That means it wants to see \u0027complete, verifiable, and irreversible\u0027 denuclearize, which is a very high bar from North Korea\u0027s perspective.The North has previously demanded the withdrawal of US troops based in the South and the end of the security alliance between Seoul and Washington, which is an extraordinary concession that it is hard to imagine any previous US president agreeing to."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/28/16/05CC4332000003E8-5444853-Theresa_May_and_Jean_Claude_Juncker_agreed_the_outline_of_a_divo-a-6_1519834166574.jpg","title":"Adorable toddler hides crisps underneath blanket hilarious attempt avoid sharing them","story":"    The tiny tot (pictured) was intent on having her snacks all to herselfShe looks around, making sure the coast is clear, then goes for it.She takes a large handful of crisps and shoves them into her mouth.Then, without a word, she places the open packet back under the blanket. All throughout, the person holding the camera, presumed to be the parent,  tries to suppress bouts of laughter.It remains unclear exactly where the video was filmed."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/09/4B009A3800000578-5598065-image-a-25_1523350542020.jpg","title":"Incredible 3D printed bungalow built scratch 15 hours","story":"    The team behind the printer are working to increase the size of the houses to several storeysRemarkable footage of the printer at work show it remotely laying concrete as it piles up the walls of the house.  Working from the ground up, the machine layers concrete in a rectangular template until the shell of a bungalow begins to form.The jaw-dropping technique leaves the building with a unique stripey pattern on its outer walls.Co-founder of Be More 3D, Vicente Ramirez, told reporters: \u0027This process allows us to reduce the costs of the building of houses by up to 35 per cent, saving time and minimising the pollution and labour risks that are caused by building.\u0027Building a house can be done in eight hours by turning up the speed of the machine.\u0027Mr Ramires also revealed his team are working to increase the size of the houses they are creating to incorporate several storeys.

Barry Gardiner fully supports that position.\u0027The row comes as the UK marks the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought decades of sectarian violence and bloodshed to an end.  But Northern Ireland is again in a political crisis after powersharing collapsed over a year ago.The DUP and Sinn Fein have been at loggerheads over a range of issues including a proposed Irish language Act. And No10 has warned that Westminster could have to step in and impose direct rule on the region for the first time in more than a decade. Mr Blair today said Theresa May must give the Northern Ireland peace process her \u0027full focus\u0027 to end the current impasse, Tony Blair warned today.The ex-Labour PM said the Good Friday Agreement had been the start of a long journey away from the Troubles.And he warned that the process still needed the \u0027full focus\u0027 of the current Prime Minister at the most crucial moments.Devolved powersharing in Belfast has been on ice for more than a year after a breakdown in relations between the Unionist DUP and Republican Sinn Fein.Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has warned that the hand of history will be \u0027heavy and unforgiving\u0027 if Brexit is allowed to \u0027undermine\u0027 the Good Friday Agreement.           Tony Blair voiced disbelief at the remark made by Barry Gardiner, saying \u0027I don\u0027t know how anyone can say that\u0027The former US secretary of state - whose husband Bill helped create the 1998 peace deal, which was signed 20 years ago today - said that reinstating a hard border would be an \u0027enormous setback\u0027 that could lead to a return to the \u0027bad old days\u0027.Britain and the EU are yet to find a solution to the question of whether there will be a hard border between the UK and Ireland after Brexit. Progress is due by the summer and failure strike an agreement acceptable to Dublin could scupper hopes of any deal at the crucial October summit. Mr Corbyn  said: \u0027The Good Friday Agreement was a defining moment in Irish history which allowed peace to prevail. It was a great achievement and I pay tribute to the work done by Tony Blair, Mo Mowlam and Paul Murphy, as well as those on all sides in Ireland, north and south, in achieving the crucial breakthrough of the peace process.\u0027No one wants to be marking the twentieth anniversary of the agreement while the assembly at Stormont remains suspended. Efforts must be redoubled to restore the assembly, and to ensure a lasting open border as part of the Brexit negotiations.\u0027There must be no return to a hard border between north and south, and no return to the horrors of the troubles. All of us on both sides of the Irish Sea have a responsibility to maintain hope for the future.\u0027The history of Ireland is a great teacher of oppression and brutality, imagination and poetry. For Irish communities everywhere – including in my own constituency – the Good Friday Agreement will always embody their hopes for peace and justice. We must cherish and learn from it for the future.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/00/03F2B940000003E8-0-image-m-45_1523316587730.jpg","title":"Museum Brexit announced","story":"Brexit trade boost as Danish and Swedish leaders push for an...Share this article\u0027In 40 years time people will think everyone we know was on the other side, as was the academic research, so how did this happen?\u0027Unless we start collecting material now we won\u0027t be able to educate people - especially the first 15 years or so where there are no digital records.

Prince Harry interviews former US President Barack Obama as part of his guest editorship of BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme in December‘This is very much about them getting married surrounded by their families and friends,’ a source said.‘It is not a big state occasion in any way. It is an intimate family wedding. Well, as intimate as a royal wedding can be.’The prince’s spokesman said the Queen backed her grandson’s decision not to invite politicians or foreign dignitaries for the sake of it.          The couple have decided not to invite any political leaders both from the UK and abroad, which means that even British Prime Minister Theresa May isn\u0027t on the list. Pictured is Prince Harry and Barack Obama at the Invictus Games in Canada last yearKensington Palace said: ‘It has been decided that an official list of political leaders – both UK and international – is not required for Prince Harry and Miss Markle’s wedding. Her Majesty’s Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.’ Government sources said Theresa May ‘wasn’t expecting an invitation’.Despite the wedding being an important national occasion, Harry is not in the direct line of succession – unlike his elder brother, Prince William, who had no choice but to invite dozens of politicians and Commonwealth representatives to his 2011 Westminster Abbey nuptials.Harry is currently fifth in line to the throne, but after the birth of his third niece or nephew later this month, will slip to sixth, behind the Cambridges’ three children.Prince Harry and Miss Markle have also chosen a much smaller venue than William and Kate, who were able to fit around 1,200 guests into Westminster Abbey, including then-Prime Minister David Cameron.

But what is the Belfast Agreement?What is the Good Friday Agreement?The Good Friday Agreement helped to end 30 years of sectarian conflict, that were also known as \u0027The Troubles\u0027. This conflict began when Northern Ireland separated from the rest of Ireland in the 1920s and away from British rule.Northern Ireland was then ided in two groups, the Unionists or the Loyalists, who wanted to remain a part of the UK and the Nationalists or the Republicans, who preferred the independence. Catholics protested after being discriminated against in the predominantly Protestant north and from the 1970s, violence erupted between armed groups on both sides. British troops were sent to the area, but came up against the largest of the Republican groups, the Irish Republican Army, or the IRA.The IRA bombed areas of Britain and Northern Ireland and Loyalists in groups like the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) were also responsible for many deaths. In 1972, the situation became markedly more serious as the IRA began targeting police officers and British army soldiers on the street.  Davis: The border impasse has become harder to resolve since Leo Varadkar became Irish PM14 people were killed by British troops during a peaceful protest led by the Catholics and Republicans in Derry and in a day that became known as Bloody Sunday, dampening hope that Northern Ireland would ever be peaceful again.However, in the 1990s, the IRA announced a ceasefire and after two years of discussions and 30 years of the Troubles, the Good Friday agreement was signed.A new government was formed with power being shared between the Unionists and the Nationalists in a group called the Northern Ireland Assembly. Every house in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was sent a copy of the agreement before the referendum was held in May 1998.The two countries voted in favour of the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Assembly took their seats in December. However, those who were against the peace, continued violence and in 2002, the Assembly was suspended and the UK government had to take over decision-making.In 2007, power was returned and the British army ended its operations in Northern Ireland, but ten years later, the deal collapsed and has yet to be restored.When was the Belfast Agreement signed?The Belfast Agreement was signed on Friday, April 10, 1998 at 5:30pm and on the day the deal was reached, US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell stated: ‘I am pleased to announce that the two governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland have reached an agreement.’Who signed the Good Friday Agreement?The Good Friday Agreement was signed by Prime Minister Tony Blair, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, SDLP leader John Hume, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin member Martin McGuinness and Labour Party politician Marjorie \u0027Mo\u0027 Mowlam.          David Davis said the Irish government had been influenced by Sinn Féin in its Brexit policyWhy did the DUP oppose the Belfast Agreement?Despite the GFA deal gaining widespread support across Ireland, Ian Paisley’s DUP was the only major party to oppose it, believing it would scupper a union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.However, distrust between parties caused problems when the agreement was first put in place, but Tony Blair managed to win over Ian Paisley. Issues also arose in 2017 when Martin McGuinness resigned as Sinn Fein deputy first minister after accusing the DUP of ‘arrogance’ while handling an energy scheme.The DUP’s Arlene Foster resigned and the Assembly collapsed, with McGuinness dying later in March 2017. Despite offers of help from Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, the DUP and Sinn Fein remain at loggerheads.Speaking in Belfast on April 10 2018, former DUP leader Peter Robinson said that he was ‘right to oppose’ the Belfast Agreement.‘Most people when they talk about the Belfast Agreement are talking about a wider process - it seems to have taken on some of the events that took place almost four years before it and every agreement that happened afterwards.‘So if we are talking about a process that has at its heart compromise, partnership, people working together to make progress, then I think the whole community should support that. The specifics of the Belfast Agreement itself, clearly I opposed - I think I was right in opposing it.’Does the Tory-DUP alliance affect the Good Friday Agreement? Despite the UK government remaining impartial when dealing with the unionists and the nationalists, a direct alliance with the DUP would change this. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams warned that a Tory-DUP alliance would lead to a \u0027coalition of chaos\u0027 and could put the GFA at risk. Alongside this, when writing for The Guardian, Jonathan Powell, the chief negotiator at the Belfast Agreement talks, said that the partnership was \u0027a terrible mistake with lasting consequences\u0027 that \u0027would risk undermining 20 years of hard work\u0027.Will Brexit be affected by the Belfast Agreement?Brexit secretary David Davis\u0027s comments about the Irish government being influenced by Sinn Féin in Britain\u0027s withdrawal from the EU could present some issues if a hard border is proposed. While Britain, Ireland and the EU have all stated that they want to avoid a hard border, many believe this is not possible with Theresa May\u0027s promise of a frictionless border while also leaving the EU customs border.While the DUP oppose a united Ireland as an alternative to remaining in the EU, Sinn Fein are touting it and officials fear that a return to before the Good Friday Agreement could occur, according to The Guardian. Former US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell warned that direct rule and a hard border could lead to a return of the violence seen from the 1970s on BBC\u0027s Today programme. George Mitchell said that a hard border would result in \u0027stereotyping resuming, demonisation resuming and people turn inward\u0027, and a lack of power-sharing could lead to \u0027regressive forces\u0027 becoming violent again.Leaders should see this as a \u0027dangerous signal...and act before there is a regression,\u0027 he added.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/16/4AE6AF5700000578-0-image-m-26_1523372505408.jpg","title":"The ruble plummets second straight day","story":"    Russia\u0027s central bank on Tuesday sought to reassure the public after new US sanctions prompted a market collapse and plunge in the ruble\u0027s valueThe US move prompted the ruble to fall on Monday and on Tuesday it fell to lows against the euro and US dollar not seen since 2016.The euro exceeded 78 rubles for the first time since April 2016 and the dollar went over 63 rubles for the first time since December 2016 on the Moscow foreign exchange market on Tuesday.\u0027The central bank has a broad spectrum of instruments in order to act in such situations, if risks arise to financial stability.

The US move prompted the ruble to fall on Monday and on Tuesday it fell to lows against the euro and US dollar not seen since 2016 The new US sanctions were announced to punish Russia for alleged attempts to subvert Western democracies. They focus on 24 iniduals and their companies and ban them from doing business with Americans. These include seven so-called oligarchs close to the Kremlin.The founder of metals giant Rusal, billionaire Oleg Deripaska, as a result saw his group lose half its value on Monday on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.The Kremlin sought to dampen the impact of the US moves, so as to avoid spreading panic.\u0027These things happen,\u0027 said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, predicting that the situation would adjust itself later.Russia is watching the situation closely and will deliver a solution that is in the country\u0027s own interests, Peskov said.On Monday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev had promised support for companies hit by sanctions.\u0027The main thing now is to minimise this uncertainty, primarily by ensuring the stable and calm functioning of the companies where hundreds of thousands work,\u0027 deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich said.\u0027We will understand later if further measures are needed,\u0027 he said. \u0027Under previous sanctions, we found the right instruments to stabilise (the economy) and reduce the impact,\u0027Economy minister Oreshkin even said that the situation was a \u0027good test\u0027 of the macroeconomic policies of the government and central bank in recent years.The ruble\u0027s \u0027freely floating exchange rate absorbs shocks,\u0027 he added.The authorities have sought to minimise the reaction to the latest wave of sanctions in comparison with the economic turbulence of recent years.\u0027Despite the very complex geopolitical situation, we preserve a certain international presence.. unlike in the 1990s when only the boldest ventured onto the Russian market,\u0027 said Alexander Afanasyev, the head of the Moscow Exchange who organised the forum.Businessman and banker Oleg Tinkov put on a brave face, telling journalists: \u0027Yesterday I lost $250 million in a day.

UCLA Law School professor Harry Litman, no fan of Dershowitz, says \u0027taint teams\u0027 work well and there\u0027s \u0027absolutely no cheating\u0027 because the stakes are so highAlthough the officers were acquitted in a California courtroom, the federal government won civil rights convictions against two of them.But the Justice Department prosecutors in the second case weren\u0027t permitted to see anything related to the earlier criminal trial, Litman explained.As a practical matter, he insisted, taint teams do their jobs well.\u0027I\u0027ve experienced it,\u0027 he said \u0027There\u0027s absolutely no cheating, certainly at the federal level. The consequences are too severe.\u0027Litman called the Justice Department \u0027ultra-hyper-vigilant, even paranoid, about this precise issue.\u0027But for Dershowitz, who helped win a murder acquittal for O.J. Simpson and succeeded in overturning the attempted murder conviction of Claus von Bülow, the constitutional issues are more important than the DOJ\u0027s trustworthiness – and bigger than the presidency.    Dershowitz said Monday night in a Fox News Channel interview that it had been \u0027a very dangerous day today for lawyer-client relations.\u0027The concept of assembling a taint team, he said, revolves around the Fifth Amendment, which protects Americans from being forced to incriminate themselves.So when the team sifts through Cohen\u0027s documents, hard drives and memory sticks, it will be searching for protected material that should be kept private.But the Fourth Amendment prohibits \u0027unreasonable\u0027 searches and seizures by the government – a description that could apply to scooping up communications between a lawyer and his client, except in extreme circumstances.And the Sixth Amendment guarantees Americans the right to \u0027the assistance of counsel\u0027 for courtroom defense, meaning no government can interfere with that relationship.Dershowitz told DailyMail.com that \u0027if the government improperly seizes private or privileged material, the violation has already occurred, even if the government never uses them.\u0027\u0027Remember who comprises the firewall and taint teams,\u0027 he explained, quoting in an email from what he said was a forthcoming column. It\u0027s \u0027other FBI agents, prosecutors and government officials who have no right under the Fourth and Sixth Amendments, even to see private or confidential materials, regardless whether it is ever used against a defendant.\u0027CNN contributor April Ryan asks if Trump is thinking about...Trump thinks he has the power to fire Mueller without...Kellyanne Conway\u0027s husband trolls Trump on Twitter with...Fire and fury: Read every word of Trump\u0027s rant after...\u0027Any evidence of any crime they now find is fair game\u0027:...Share this articleUltimately, Dershowitz\u0027s beef may be with whichever federal judge green-lighted the DOJ\u0027s request for a search warrant covering the places where Cohen lives and works.It\u0027s likely that the agency convinced the jurist that Cohen had documents showing evidence of a crime. But even so, the Harvard professor said, those documents could have been privately subpoenaed.He compared Monday\u0027s document dragnet to government surveillance of a confession heard by a priest, a patient\u0027s discussion with her doctor, or a husband and wife talking about their sex life.\u0027The government simply has no right to this material,\u0027 he said.Washington, D.C. criminal defense lawyer Barry Pollack told the Associated Press on Tuesday that it is \u0027extremely rare\u0027 for authorities to conduct searches in lawyers\u0027 offices. Such a search warrant is a measure of last resort because of problems posed by the attorney-client privilege, according to the Justice Department\u0027s manual for federal prosecutors.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/15/4B04013A00000578-0-image-a-90_1523371987689.jpg","title":"Minister slams greed British Gas","story":"Bleak photo that proves the wowsers have killed Sydney\u0027s...Share this articleIt comes as Money Mail today reveals the catalogue of dirty tricks being used by  energy giants to make consumers accept smart meters.British Gas, the country’s biggest energy supplier, said the increase in the Standard Variable Tariff (SVT) was partly the result of a rise in the wholesale cost of energy.But it also blamed Government-imposed costs designed to encourage a switch to green energy through subsidies to wind farms, and support for the poor to install energy-saving measures in their homes.

It’s madness.”She hopes the thousands of travellers arriving every day by Eurostar from mainland Europe into the soaring 19th-century station will read her words, which were unveiled on Tuesday, and feel the love.“I don’t personally want to leave Europe at all – and this is my message to all Europeans. I love Europe. I’m not saying there are no problems with Europe, of course there are, so many of them, but it’s so much easier to sort problems from the inside.”Emin said the sentence had come straight into her mind, but it had taken a year to create the largest so far of what have become trademark works spelling out her texts in her own handwriting.“It looks effortless, it looks really simple but health and safety … believe me, it was really difficult. The main thing is the train drivers coming in must not be shocked, and so you can’t use some colours, no red or green or yellow.”Health and safety meant the letters had to use LEDs rather than her usual neon, but they were always going to be pink, she said.“At night the whole station will be bathed in a pink light, and it will make people happy, I promise you, it will make people smile because pink will make them feel good.”Interviewed on the BBC’s Today programme, Emin gave no more clues about her weekend revelation that she had once been sexually assaulted by “a well-known female artist” who had attempted to grab her crotch at a party. Emin had responded by threatening to “punch her lights out”. Women should have the confidence to respond to any such assault at the time, she told John Humphrys: “I shouted and I caused such a scene, and I told everybody what she had done, much to their humiliation and embarrassment. I don’t think they’ll be doing that again in a hurry.”“Everybody is making accusations and saying things about men, but it happens with everybody in many different circumstances – people don’t seem to be seeing the whole picture that harassment is actually bullying in a lot of cases as well.”The St Pancras light work is a commission from the station owner and the Royal Academy, and will be seen by an estimated 50 million travellers over the year. Tim Marlow, the artistic director of the Royal Academy, called Emin one of the most important and influential artists in the world. “Her work is intense and compelling and blurs the boundaries between the personal and the public and between art and life,” he said.After time in the station Emin said she hoped the piece might find a home in Europe – or in her native Margate.Apart from wrapping her arms around Europe, Emin said she hoped one day her words could have a more personal resonance: “I desperately hope to be met at the train station in a really romantic way – one day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/907d49c566d338afb697baa2469cfbce89e27970/0_0_5971_4208/master/5971.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ff4899529b07601e71a244220d37f6f6 1320w","title":"a rosy future nestle launches pink kitkats with ruby chocolate","story":"Swiss experts spent decade developing naturally coloured cocoa on sale in UK this weekThe chocolate coating is an Instagrammable lurid lipstick pink with the promise of a unique “intense fruity taste”.UK consumers will next week be the first in Europe able to buy Nestlé’s four-finger KitKat, made with so-called ruby chocolate from specially selected cocoa beans.KitKat is the first major brand in the UK to feature this innovative but “naturally coloured” new chocolate, made from ruby cocoa beans grown in the Ivory Coast, Ecuador and Brazil. It was created by Swiss chocolatier Barry Callebaut - the world’s largest cocoa processor - which spent more than a decade unlocking and experimenting with the beans’ colours and flavours. The flavour is described by the company as “a tension between berry-fruitiness and luscious smoothness” but no extra colours or flavours are added to create the pinky hue, which instead comes from a powder extracted during the processing. It is not as sweet as milk chocolate, according to its creators, with a lighter flavour instead.Ruby chocolate – a fourth chocolate after traditional dark, milk and white – has been attracting huge interest from chocolate connoisseurs throughout the world since it was first revealed in September last year. It is claimed to be the first new natural colour for chocolate since Nestlé unveiled white chocolate more than 80 years ago.The new KitKat was introduced earlier this year in Japan and Korea, where consumers are no strangers to unusual variations of the popular confectionery. In Japan the varieties on sale at any given time stretch to dozens, including purple sweet potato, edamame bean and wasabi. In the UK it will go on sale in branches of Tesco on 16 April. “We know that a new type of KitKat is a really big deal and we are very excited to be able to offer a different type of chocolate for fans to try” said Alex Gonnella, marketing director for Nestlé’s UK confectionery business. “Ruby chocolate is a big innovation in confectionery and we are very proud that KitKat is the first major brand in the UK to feature this exciting new chocolate.”Pablo Perversi, chief innovation, quality and sustainability officer at Barry Callebaut, said: “I am very pleased to see the result of our partnership with Nestlé – the iconic four-finger KitKat made with our ruby chocolate.

Will it work?It’s Good Friday in Brisbane and most of the city is dead quiet, with pubs and clubs not opening until midnight due to Easter trading laws. In the inner suburb of West End, however, something very noisy is stirring.On a makeshift stage in a large room, a three-piece band called Hexmere is playing a raucous, raw brand of grindcore punk to a small crowd. There’s another gig planned for the following night, with many more people expected.These all-ages shows are being sporadically staged by the Outer Space art collective, which won the Brisbane city council’s tender to operate this 300-capacity venue for two years, rent-free. The space needs work. But it represents an experiment, a gamble and a new hope for the city’s youth culture.The fact that the city council chose to make the space available is important. Despite a rich history, live music in Brisbane, as in so many other cities around the world, struggles to survive against the pressures of gentrification, regulation and competition.The music industry’s inextricable links to alcohol and bars has left a dearth of venues accessible to under-18s, raising concerns about how the complex ecosystem that sustains a vibrant local music scene – comprising everything from record shops to independent labels to public radio – will reproduce itself without engaging audiences from a young age.Live from Outer Space is an attempt to buck that trend in Brisbane. Coordinator Alex Campbell watches Hexmere as sound technician Hannah buzzes around the room, checking noise levels and sonic balance. Campbell says she has encouraged women and non-binary people to get involved in the male-dominated space of sound engineering especially.In the crowd tonight are the three members of the Goon Sax, back home in Brisbane after seven months in Berlin. Their 19-year-old frontman, Louis Forster, is the son of the Go-Betweens’ Robert – less than half a mile from the venue, the Go Between Bridge s the Brisbane river. But surfing the city’s next wave hasn’t been easy, even for a band with such pedigree.While the Goon Sax’s members were under 18, the venues they played required them to be accompanied by a parent and to leave immediately after their set, while their friends were unable to attend.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.“It’s cool something like this has opened up,” says Forster. “I know my sister’s psyched about it – she’s 16 and she’s coming tomorrow night. I was pretty frustrated by it when I was a kid growing up. I remember going to soundchecks and standing outside venues and listening, stuff like that.”Brisbane takes some pride in its musical past – another international export, the Saints, are the subject of a mural celebrating their achievements on the other side of the river, and the band’s guitarist Ed Kuepper has a local park named after him. But the council’s decision to back Outer Space represents a recognition of the need to invest in the city’s cultural future.“There’s all these young kids who don’t have any places to go,” says Louis Whelan, who is director of Outer Space’s all-ages live-music programme and also plays in his own band, the Mouldy Lovers. “Most events are really alcohol-focused. Playing somewhere where people are just going to get wasted, it’s not the same thing as playing where people want to see music.“If there’s a whole new generation of people who are much more engaged with the arts and music, then when they get out and they have disposable incomes, they’re going to go to galleries, to venues, to buy local bands’ music and start their own labels. I think there’s a lot of value in it.”It’s not just kids who are struggling to find places to play. In Sydney – once a live-music Mecca to rival London or New York – bands now struggle to play at all, with venues under pressure from soaring real estate prices, noise complaints, punitive regulations and a cosy relationship between government and developers. The city’s longest-serving live venue, The Basement – which, over 45 years, has hosted artists from Dizzy Gillespie to Prince – closed last week, though its owners are hopeful of finding other premises.The situation has become so difficult that the state of New South Wales is now holding a parliamentary inquiry. Dave Faulkner, singer and songwriter of enduring Australian garage band the Hoodoo Gurus, told the inquiry that live music was treated like the sex industry, “as something to be shunned. We employ so many people, we generate incredible amounts of money throughout the economy – and yet we’re treated so badly.”Faced with similar issues, music scenes around the world have been forced underground, into house parties or often illegal warehouse gigs, accessible only to those in the know. “It starts to get a bit worrying when kids are in those scenes,” says Emily Collins, managing director of the government-funded advocacy body MusicNSW. “We’d much rather them be in venues where we can make sure it’s safe and they can learn to love music in a safe and supporting environment. At warehouse parties there are no security guards, there’s no regulation, no one monitoring alcohol consumption. And they’re more focused on over-18 activities anyway – not that anyone is checking ID.”All-ages shows have a twofold benefit, says Collins: they foster a self-sustaining community of audiences and performers that in turn helps nurture a creative city. The sticking point, particularly in Australia, is breaking the nexus between music and alcohol.Venues, already under severe financial duress, are reluctant to put on events where no money is coming over the bar and the regulatory environment is forbidding. “There are multiple bodies that need to be satisfied, so there is considerable complexity, high costs and red tape in running a compliant venue,” says Julian Knowles, chair of MusicNSW and a professor of music at Macquarie University.“There is no ‘agent of change’ law in New South Wales that puts the responsibility on developers to soundproof new developments near music venues. If new residents make noise complaints, the venue is held accountable and must meet acoustic treatment costs, so it’s very risky for venue operators. At best, it erodes business confidence and at worst it can shut down venues entirely.”The introduction of controversial lockout laws in 2014, imposing curfews on venues in a bid to curb alcohol-related violence more associated with nightclubs than live music events, have been relaxed to some degree, but otherwise only worsened the operating environment.Against this backdrop, MusicNSW offers funding to promoters and venues to stage all-ages shows, but Collins says applications are few. “People say it’s too hard as a venue – $15,000 won’t cut it.”Often bands are paid literally out of beer takings. “They’re basically saying: the more heavy drinkers attend your gig, the better you’ll get paid,” says Ray Ahn, bass player of another longstanding punk band, the Hard-Ons. “With that kind of a working model, it’s harder to organise all-ages shows. Where’s the money going to come from?”The parliamentary inquiry underlines what a cautionary tale Sydney has become. Dave Faulkner said the city’s culture was dying. “When people come to Sydney they don’t just come to see the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, they also go to have a night out and to see music – it’s what I do when I go to London or New York. But Sydney has been doing everything it can to destroy those places of entertainment and turn them into apartment buildings.”In the late 70s and early 80s, hundreds of pubs and clubs throughout the city and suburbs kept artists busy, with major Australian bands such as Midnight Oil honing their live skills by playing upwards of 200 shows a year.From the late 80s to the early 90s, Ahn says, the Hard-Ons would often play an all-ages show in the afternoon and another for over-18s in the evening. Now, they might have played one all-ages show in Australia in the last 10 years. When the band tour Europe or Japan, though, it’s a different story.“A lot of the shows we do in Europe are in purpose-built halls that have the bar on the outside,” Ahn says. “Inside, there is no bar – it’s like a flat-ceilinged room with a massive PA and volunteers running around everywhere. So where are they getting the money from? They’re getting it from the city council.”The environment in Germany was more easygoing, says Louis Forster, even when he was younger. “I spent a lot of time there growing up, and I could always get into venues – it was never a problem. Parents would bring their kids to shows, which was really fantastic.”In Australia, Melbourne actively promotes itself as the live-music capital, and with good reason. A Deloitte study in 2011 valued the sector’s economic contribution at over half a billion dollars, with small venues providing the bulk of revenue and employment. Though many venues have closed in recent years, the value of investing in the live-music sector at grassroots level has long been recognised.The Push, a not-for-profit youth music organisation, has been operating in Victoria since 1986, providing a launch platform for countless bands. As well as all-ages shows, it puts on mentoring programmes and skills workshops.Shaad D’Souza, a music journalist who used to coordinate all-ages events for the organisation, notes that it is a cultural investment as well as a financial one. “Lots of kids, when they grow up they’ll only really go to big festivals or big arena shows because that’s all they’ve had access to,” he says. “Whereas if you’re investing in all-ages shows, they develop a relationship with venues, they develop a relationship with artists, and then they know: ‘I want to support my local scene.’ They want to go to smaller venues they don’t just want to go to arena shows or festivals.”At the end of the night, Alex Campbell’s band, Bad Bangers, will launch their EP. The band are in their 20s now. “But that’s kind of why we started this – because there weren’t many all-ages spaces when we were younger.”In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

In the most recent edition, Melbourne was declared the world’s most liveable city for the seventh year running, with Adelaide fifth, Perth seventh, Sydney 11th and Brisbane 16th.Yet from long commutes and high car dependency to the low provision of affordable housing in the more appealing areas, Australian cities still have plenty of room for improvement.The Centre for Urban Research’s Creating Liveable Cities in Australia report provides the first baseline measure of liveability in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra, Darwin and Hobart. The result of five years of research, it examines walkability, public transport, public open spaces, housing affordability, commuting and access to food and alcohol.The walkability index combines dwelling density, daily-living destinations and street connectivity. It showed that a minority of residents in Australians cities live in walkable communities. With few exceptions, walkability is generally concentrated in inner suburbs. Despite the health and environmental benefits of walking, Australian cities are still being designed for cars. One notable exception was found: some new, walkable areas being built in outer-suburban Perth.In Sydney and Brisbane particularly, housing affordability stress is spread across large areas of the city. However, in all cities, those suburbs enduring the greatest stress were located towards the urban fringe. Given that outer suburbs also have poor access to public transport, and are less likely to be walkable, household expenditure on cars is likely to be higher there than in other areas. This suggests that continued suburban expansion will not improve housing affordability. Unlike other indicators of liveability, outer suburban areas mostly have better access to public open space than inner-city areas. Across Melbourne, Perth, Sydney and Brisbane, there are more fast-food outlets on average than supermarkets within 3.2km of residents’ homes.Previous research has shown that in Melbourne the density of off-licences in disadvantaged areas corresponded to poorer self-rated health. This reflects other Australian research showing that the density of alcohol outlets is associated with harmful alcohol consumption and alcohol-related violence, and that more alcohol outlets appear to be located in more disadvantaged areas.Due to difficulties in obtaining alcohol data, these indicators were created for only four cities: Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Sydney.

There was, however, no euphoria. This was partly\u0026nbspbecause everyone knew the conflict that was being brought to an end had been slow and sordid. It had been allowed to drag on long after victory for any side had become an obvious impossibility. There was too much sorrow, too many lives lost or blighted for no purpose, for unabashed exultation to be either warranted or decent.But there was also a better, nobler reason for the absence of real jubilation. The agreement wasn’t about\u0026nbspwinning. Its signing was not one of those epic, historic moments when a Bastille falls or a wall is torn down. It was, in fact, the exact opposite: a mutual acceptance that no such millennial moments were in prospect for anyone. There was not going to be a grand\u0026nbspceremony when all the union jacks were hauled down and the British army marched off to the ports, never to return. Neither was there going to be a surrender of the IRA, an abject renunciation of the demands of Irish nationalism.On the contrary, what the agreement was really about was devising a way for everyone to get over the loss of such dreams of once-and-for-all victories. It set an example that might have done a great service to the rest of Britain. But as Barry Gardiner’s characterisation of the agreement as a shibboleth, and the constant drumbeat of dismissiveness from pro-Brexit extremists have made clear, that lesson has yet to be learned.The genius of the agreement was that it took an unanswerable question and changed it. The unanswerable question was: what are you prepared to die for? A United Kingdom or a United Ireland? They were mutually exclusive concepts. The new question was not what are you prepared to die for, but what are you willing to live with.The Good Friday gamble was that people could live with complexity, contingency, ambiguity. Twenty years on, in a world that is spinning backwards into the worst kind of identity politics, the agreement seems to matter even more than it did in 1998, precisely because it makes tolerance of uncertainty the great civic virtue.Part of that uncertainty lay with the agreement’s own moral ambiguity. There is no hiding the fact that it made concessions to killers, including the release from prison of some mass murderers. Nor is there any point in denying that its provisions for the internal governance of Northern Ireland actually exaggerated and institutionalised sectarian isions. The language of “parity of esteem” between “two traditions” – Protestantunionist versus Catholicnationalist – essentially ignored\u0026nbspthe third tradition of those who did not wish to be defined by these tribal categories.And the cost of this has been huge. The middle ground from which the agreement itself came has been narrowed. The moral and intellectual architect of the agreement, John Hume, had to watch his own Social Democratic and Labour party be eaten up by Sinn Féin. On the other side, David Trimble’s Ulster Unionist party, which signed the agreement, has been displaced by the Democratic Unionist party, which did not. “Parity\u0026nbspof esteem” quickly came to be translated into a logic of tribal competition that has undermined the very institutions it was meant to sustain.These problems need to be addressed, and if it were not for the crazy distractions of Brexit, the 20th anniversary would be a very good occasion for a fundamental review of the agreement’s internal workings. They should not, however, detract from the boldness, radicalism and imaginative brilliance of the agreement as a whole. It did something that sovereign\u0026nbspgovernments had not done before, which is to create a political space that is claimed by nobody – a space, moreover, that exists not in a physical territory but inside people’s heads.At the core of the agreement is its statement that people born in Northern Ireland have an absolute right to be “Irish or British or both as they may so choose”. We have here, written down in a binding international treaty, a recognition that national identity is not a territorial or genetic imperative, and is not necessarily a single thing. It is chosen, and therefore open to a change of mind. And it can be multiple: those six letters – “or both” – are the glory of the agreement, its promise and its\u0026nbspchallenge.The agreement tries to replace eitheror with bothand. It comes from the bitter knowledge that eitheror – Catholic or Protestant, unionist or nationalist, Irish or British, them or us, victory or defeat – is a deadly option. It holds up a notion of purity that is neither attainable in practice nor desirable in principle. Bothand pushes away the illusory satisfactions of purity and seeks out the common decency of everyday life, in which we all live with complex ideas of belonging.What we did not imagine 20 years ago was that the pursuit of a pure identity would return as a governing\u0026nbspproject – not in Northern Ireland, but in England. We could not have foreseen that the euphoria of victory would animate politics on these islands again. It seemed, in those days of sober hope, that we had all gone beyond thinking that people could belong to only one thing.• Fintan O’Toole is an author and columnist for the Irish\u0026nbspTimes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3632dcdbdb339234088f1b26101f5bc4d33fea74/0_161_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4b7cf8af5bd0d82b67967a3e19dc5e89 1240w","title":"israel russia syria netanyahu iran middle east","story":"Clever wheezes in the Middle East have the tendency to not look very smart for very long. A case in point, as has become sharply evident this week, is the much-vaunted “deconfliction” arrangement between Russia and Israel after the former entered the war in Syria on the side of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Negotiated between Vladimir Putin and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, it was held up at first as evidence of the latter’s diplomatic skills – an arrangement that allowed Israel a free hand against weapons transfers from Iran to Hezbollah and maintained Israeli deterrence on its northern border.Over seven years, the civil war has dragged in multiple foreign nations, turning what started as a pro-democracy uprising into a quagmire of overlapping conflicts.Global powerhouses including Iran, Israel, Russia, Turkey, and the United States have all, to different extents, engaged their militaries in the conflict. At the same time, they have supported warring factions on the ground, including Iran-allied Hezbollah, Kurdish militia, and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces alliance. Islamic State and al-Qaida are also present.If that arrangement has for long looked very shaky, the reaction of Russia and Iran to Israeli strikes this week on an airbase in Syria, killing seven Iranian advisers, has brutally exposed the assumptions that underlie it, not least Moscow’s tolerance for Israel’s assumption of its freedom of action.The reality is that Israel – and Netanyahu in particular – has badly misread the trajectory of Russia’s re-engagement in the Middle East, which has created in the very kindest interpretation the context for Iran’s projection of its influence ever further west and ever closer to Israel’s borders.Why all this matters in the current febrile context following the latest alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria, is that Israel’s misjudgments sit at one corner of a dangerous matrix of unpredictability, perhaps unseen – as James Hohmann argued in the Washington Post – since the secretary of state Dean Acheson suggested in 1950 that Korea was outside the core defence perimeter of the US.On the American side that uncertainty around intentions has seen Donald Trump flip-flop so dramatically that in a handful of days he has somersaulted from suggesting first that his country was rushing for the exit on Syria to a situation where military strikes seem likely.In Israel, a wounded Netanyahu – who has built an entire political career on promising to be a bulwark against Iran – is now being confronted with his rhetoric and the consequence of his actions, not least his bloody public pricking of Iran in a way that Tehran may now find hard to discount.In the final corner there is Putin, whose calculations are opaque because that is his intention – not least over his ambitions and red lines.The result is a highly combustible situation in which no party to the conflict – direct or otherwise – can be certain of the assumptions that the others are operating under.All of which has created what Stephen Pinker describes in his illuminating book on violence and war, The Better Angels of Our Nature, as a classic “security” or “Hobbesian” dilemma, a situation where actions by a state ostensibly to heighten their security can prompt other states to act pre-emptively, risking a fugue of escalation. As more violence seems likely, what is also troubling is that the key mechanism for avoiding such an escalation – the UN security council – seems profoundly weakened by the further weaponisation of the US and Russian vetoes under both Trump and Putin.History teaches us that wars – from the first world war to Korea, the six-day war and the Falklands – are often fuelled by failures of messaging and interpretation.Looking around the Middle East today never has that felt more true. And never have wise heads been in such short supply.• Peter Beaumont is a Guardian reporter and former Jerusalem correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ab5e02b4913589399324d8bbe8070c3db914551/0_0_3488_2093/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7c0b7972ac651ba2892b1b80f065f69d 1240w","title":"the guardian view on shoe box britain space is good for us lets have some","story":"So it is bizarre that the UK is one of the few western European nations to have no mandatory minimum space standards for housing. Little wonder that other nations have bigger homes while the UK gets shoe boxes. Ministers did introduce voluntary space standards for new homes in 2015, but as these could be ignored they only gave the appearance of solidity to pure wind. When this ruse was called out in 2016, the government said it would review how these were operating. Nothing has appeared. Part of this is to do with a rightwing legacy: Margaret Thatcher got rid of rules that set a reasonable internal size for public housing. Reintroducing legal standards in the interests of society is the right thing to do. It would also be a repudiation of a Thatcherite legacy, and is at odds with the direction of travel in housing.Houses are needed and the reasons are largely to do with social justice, inequality and the distribution of political power. There must be an acknowledgment of the psychological comforts that domesticity affords. Past rules would need to be updated – homes must no longer find space for dining tables and upright pianos but be designed for the activities and furniture that are typical today. The Grenfell Tower tragedy provided a new background for politicians to think about housing. For too long politicians have cultivated voters reliant on house prices remaining high, and rising. The policies that have allowed this have had a damaging impact on a growing proportion of the population. So far Theresa May’s government has exaggerated how far it is prepared to intervene on the side of this section of society. Setting mandatory standards for house sizes is one test of whether this rhetoric will yield to reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1492e0e13c7dc32017a66fbc6e33bdd8e853eb6/628_1529_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dc75e04c19daf1588f4fbce39f5ae99f 1240w","title":"tiny violins moaning pretty being beautiful blessing curse samantha brick","story":"Being beautiful mainly seems a blessing. But it can be a curse – and the main problem is that you are just not allowed to complain about itIt’s tough being beautiful. Other women, women who are not so genetically blessed, despise you, you see. They worry you will steal their husband. They get together with their average-looking friends and say nasty things behind your inordinately elegant back. They think that, just because you have flawless skin, you don’t have feelings. But you do have feelings: tragically, the world can’t look past your cut-glass cheekbones and understand that.If you have ever wondered What It’s Like to Go Through Life As a Really Beautiful Woman, this is about the sum of it, apparently. At least, according to an article published last week on New York magazine’s lifestyle website, the Cut. In it, an anonymous woman in her late 50s explains that being attractive opened a lot of doors for her in life, but also made women hate her. I’m fairly sure the beautiful-but-damned subject of the article wasn’t Samantha Brick, but it is very much reminiscent of her infamous 2012 magnum opus in the Daily Mail, There are Downsides to Looking This Pretty: Why Women Hate Me for Being Beautiful. And, like Brick’s much-laughed-at lament, it was immediately and mercilessly mocked on social media.Rightly so. The article reads like a parody, parroting tiresome tropes about jealous, catty women. Yet it’s a shame the response to the piece descended so swiftly into jeers. There is an interesting and important conversation to be had about what it’s like to go through life as a really beautiful woman – or a very handsome man. Looks aren’t everything, but count for a lot. We might not like to admit it, but we are all prone to treating people differently according to their appearance. Studies show that even babies prefer looking at more attractive faces. But while we are all affected by beauty biases, I’m not sure we are often prompted to examine and curb them – and they have real repercussions.But while beauty mainly seems to be a blessing, it can also be a curse. Being considered attractive works against you if you are a woman applying for a traditionally “masculine” job, for example. In 2015, a study from University College London’s School of Management found that while handsome men are seen as more competent, this makes them less likely to be hired in competitive workplaces because they are perceived as a threat. Funny, isn’t it? Despite there being clear evidence that men can be threatened by other men’s looks, they are rarely accused of same-sex jealousy in the way women are. It is almost as if society goes out of its way to pit women against each other.Ultimately, it seems that the main problem with being attractive is that people are not allowed to complain about it. As articles like the one in the Cut make clear, nothing brings out the sarcastic tiny violins faster than someone moaning about the pitfalls of aesthetic perfection. While that may be understandable, I think it is also worth understanding that society sometimes penalises prettiness. Let’s not be so quick to hate on people just because they write op-eds about being beautiful.It’s a big week for Mark Zuckerberg, who is appearing in front of Congress to apologise for inadvertently undermining democracy. Facebook reportedly prepared for this personal responsibility (PR) exercise by bringing in an army of experts to give its CEO a “crash course” in charm – a quality the ZuckBot is not known for.What does this charm curriculum comprise? If I happened to control a complex system of mass surveillance or was as good at hacking as certain Tory MPs, I would be able to tell you in detail. Sadly, this is not the case. So, I can only speculate that preparations kicked off with careful scrutiny of the personal data of all the politicians Zuck will be meeting. People like it when you ask them about themselves, Mark! Why not try asking that congressman – you know, the one who has been having a secret affair for the past three months – how he liked the new carbonara recipe he tried the other day?Facebook being Facebook, I imagine some fancy tech was involved in updating MZ’s interpersonal operating system. An empathy algorithm, perhaps, devised to recommend meaningful semantic structures that build a sense of genuine community. Or maybe there is proprietary communication code that prompts Zuckerberg to nod and say “yes” at regular intervals to make it seem as if he is actually listening and not just counting the minutes until he can escape from having to interact with mere mortals.Or maybe charm training was a little more analogue than that. Perhaps Zuckerberg was just advised to take off that unflattering T-shirt and wear a suit. Perhaps he was told to say the word “sorry” a statistically significant number of times. After all, if you repeat any old nonsense long enough, people will believe it. Facebook knows that better than just about anyone.One day you tweet a question about whether snakes fart, the next you’ve landed a book deal about animal flatulence. Well, Dani Rabaiotti knows how it is, anyway. Last year, the environmental scientist sent a tweet that turned into a viral hashtag (#doesitfart) that turned into a book called Does It Fart: the Definitive Field Guide to Animal Flatulence. This includes must-know information such as the fact that sloths don’t break wind. Meanwhile, seal farts smell like fish, while herrings use their liberated gas to communicate with each other, much like small children. The book only came out in the US last week, but it was released in Britain last year. I guess the UK is inordinately receptive to hot air."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f0ed366f71b448c34488fd0cc6ee0c1d379146e/0_149_3262_1957/master/3262.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2605ce20856debbceefd5f8036b472f8 1720w","title":"greater glider hotspot logged against victorian governments own advice","story":"Exclusive: State government-commissioned survey shows Strathbogie forest has very high densities of threatened speciesA nationally significant hotspot for the greater glider, a federally listed threatened species, is being logged by the Victorian forest agency, VicForests.The logging started at Barjarg Flat in the Strathbogie forest in north-east Victoria in February. This was two months after a preliminary update of a government fauna survey conducted by the Arthur Rylah Institute (ARI) documented what are claimed to be the highest-ever densities of greater gliders in the state in that area.Guardian Australia has obtained a draft copy of the ARI’s three-page Strathbogie greater glider survey report, created at the completion of the survey in mid-December 2017. The ARI has confirmed that the report and the information contained in it is “accurate”. The institute has told stakeholders that the report is in an “advanced draft stage”, and the final report will be available by the end of April. Despite the report still being in draft form, Andrew McGuire, VicForests regional manager for the north-east, advised Bertram Lobert, a founding member of the Strathbogie forest group, in an email dated 20 February 2018 that “VicForests is using (the ARI) survey data to guide the harvest plan for these coupes”. The logging also went ahead despite a recommendation to Victoria’s minister for energy, environment and climate change, Lily D’Ambrosio, on 4 November 2016 from the Victorian flora and fauna scientific advisory committee (SAC) that the minister support “an interim suspension of timber harvesting” in the Strathbogie ranges.Prof Barbara Evans, the convener of the SAC , wrote again to D’Ambrosio on 24 November 2016, concerned about the “significant impact” logging could have on greater gliders in the Strathbogies.In November 2016, the SAC assessed that the glider species was “in a demonstrable rate of decline which is likely to result in extinction” in Victoria and recommended it be protected under the state’s flora and fauna guarantee act. It was formally listed as threatened in May 2017. In 2016, the ARI had agreed with SAC that glider populations had declined sharply elsewhere and that the “relatively large” population in the Strathbogies “is an important refuge”. Details of the concerns held by the SAC and the ARI are contained in ministerial briefing documents released in May last year under a freedom of information application, but the significance of the Strathbogie greater glider population was not reported at the time.As a result of those concerns and information from a 2017 citizen science project by the Strathbogie Sustainable Forest Group (SSFG), the official ARI survey was approved by D’Ambrosio and set up in mid-2017 as a collaborative project of the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP), VicForests and SSFG. It was concluded in December 2017.“It’s not a secret. VicForests had the survey results showing the highest ever documented greater glider densities in Victoria – possibly Australia – in the Barjarg Flat forest coupe, but they deliberately chose to log it,” said Lobert.“That’s why we’re so angered that nothing has been done to stop it. Minister D’Ambrosio has the power to protect the greater glider, but it appears she’s politically hobbled by an unsupportive premier and cabinet.Last month, Guardian Australia revealed concerns by state and federal forest ministers that renewed RFAs in Tasmania, NSW, Victoria and Western Australia could be legally vulnerable without new comprehensive scientific studies.VicForest’s spokesman, Alex Messina, said the logging was a “low-intensity process … based on community consultation and preference”.But Lobert said: “We’ve been opposed to VicForests’ logging of Barjarg Flat and other coupes with high greater glider densities from the outset.”The logging breaks a commitment VicForests gave the DELWP in 2017 that there would be no further forestry operations in the Strathbogie ranges until 2019.  As well as the disputed Barjarg Flat coupe that is currently being logged, there were nine other forestry coupes targeted for logging in the Strathbogie Ranges on VicForests’ 2016 timber release plan. Those remain identified for logging in VicForests 2017 timber release plan.In September 2017, D’Ambrosio told Guardian Australia the state government was working on protecting the greater glider “as a priority”.At the time, the minister said a draft action statement would be published in early 2018, but this is yet to be released.In a new statement, a Victorian government representative said: “Timber harvesting in the Strathbogie forest is legal provided VicForests complies with relevant laws, including the code of practice for timber harvesting.”The official said work was “well advanced” on an action statement to protect the glider.During the ARI survey, three forestry coupes considered for immediate logging – Barjarg Flat, Mr Hat and Tartan – recorded more than 10 greater gliders per kilometre.VicForests confirmed to Guardian Australia that in East Gippsland, more than 10 greater gliders per kilometre automatically triggered a 100-hectare exclusion zone, but these zones do not apply in the rest of the state.One of the ARI transects through the Barjang Flat coupe identified 14 greater gliderS over 500 metres – equivalent to 28 animals per kilometre.“I haven’t seen those kinds of numbers in any of the long-term survey work we have done in southern Australia over the past 35 years,” said Prof David Lindenmayer from the Fenner School at the ANU.“Greater gliders are in nationwide decline. They’ve gone regionally extinct at Jervis Bay on the south coast of NSW, and over the past 20 years, their population has crashed by two-thirds in the mountain ash forests of Central Victoria.“The federal and state governments know about this serious decline across the glider’s range. They’ve hosted workshops into the problem in 2016 and 2017. “For VicForests to know that there were such high densities of greater gliders in the Strathbogies and go ahead and log anyway shows that the system is broken.“VicForests has lost its social and environmental licence, and the department of environment, which is meant to be regulating VicForests, has been shown to be utterly useless and toothless.”In an earlier written response to Guardian Australia’s questions, Messina said, “VicForests is using “single-tree selection” in the Strathbogies, a different low intensity process compared to previous harvesting in the area, and chosen based on community consultation and preference.“This harvesting removes far fewer trees, leaving roughly half but still supporting regeneration in this uneven aged forest.”Messina said VicForests’ bioersity conservation and research manager thoroughly assessed the coupe for endangered native species and their habitat before harvesting, and weekly checks continued during the logging operations.“VicForests does this voluntarily for the greater glider and other threatened species even though there is no current prescription for the glider in the central highlands. An action statement is being developed by government and once complete VicForests will modify its harvesting practices, where required, to comply with any additional prescriptions.”According to Bertram Lobert, after recent communication with VicForests, logging of Barjarg Flat will continue for several weeks, with a “regeneration burn” to follow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dfbea2a048105f15eb8ce80dd3472e29e9c435a/122_183_3350_2011/master/3350.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c64621467a293be308848f8e7b2a6bc9 1240w","title":"manchester city liverpool champions league match report","story":"In the away end there were songs about winning the European Cup and, this being Liverpool, thousands of euphoric voices joining in with the follow-up shout of “again”. And why not? Liverpool had survived a whirlwind, to use Jürgen Klopp’s description, and at the end of this epic tussle it was a sunrise of a smile on the German’s face. His team were in the semi-finals and Manchester City, once again, had been cut adrift from a competition where they repeatedly fall short.Pep Guardiola’s team will have to make do with the Premier League title whereas Liverpool will go into Friday’s draw because over the two legs they were more clinical during their spells of superiority. Klopp’s team had the better balance between attack and defence and, crucially, they got lucky with the disallowed goal that brought Guardiola to the point of spontaneous combustion at half-time. Guardiola’s fit of pique led to his banishment from the dugout and City will wonder what might have happened if they had taken a 2-0 lead into the second half.Instead City have lost three games in seven days, conceding eight goals in the process, and Klopp has been proved correct with his assertion that the best way to take on the Premier League champions-elect is to examine an accident-prone defence. Nicolás Otamendi’s part in Roberto Firmino’s goal was a case in point and, once that had gone in, the two sets of players were going through the motions for the rest of the match. City needed five goals, or roughly one every three minutes, to save themselves and, realistically, the game had been settled once Mohamed Salah clipped in Liverpool’s equaliser earlier in the second half.Might it have been any different had Leroy Sané’s goal, late in the first half, not been wrongly given offside? Nobody will ever know but it was certainly true that City were threatening a remarkable feat of escapology in that part of the match. They had scored inside two minutes, courtesy of Gabriel Jesus. They still had Sergio Agüero to bring off the bench and the Etihad was overdosing on optimism. For the game to finish with an aggregate 5-1 score distorts the fact the occasion was full of drama and suspense until Salah’s goal conclusively changed the complexion of the evening.Ultimately, though, Liverpool had inflicted a grievous result in the first leg when they scored three times in a 19-minute blitz and, importantly, did not concede an away goal. Guardiola’s team gave everything. They chased every ball, attacked from every angle and, for a long time, the early goal encouraged the sense there were more to follow. It would be exaggerating to say Liverpool were on their knees but they did need to catch their breath and City were merciless in that respect. If the ball was out of play, someone in blue would dash to get it back. This was not a side licking its wounds from the humbling of Anfield or Saturday’s ordeal against Manchester United. It was the best team in England with adrenaline running through their veins, playing as if they believed anything was achievable.That was how it was in the first half anyway. Liverpool were much more composed after the break and Guardiola was always taking a calculated gamble fielding an experimental three-man central defence including two players, Kyle Walker and Aymeric Laporte, who doubled up as attacking full-backs. Otamendi’s selection ahead of Vincent Kompany was difficult to fathom and, apart from Fernandinho, City’s line-up was otherwise filled with attacking players.Nobody can ever question Guardiola’s sense of adventure but the potential for danger was obvious when Liverpool have such a brilliantly effective counter-attacking side.Sure enough, the killer moment arrived in the 56th minute. Salah’s through-ball gave Sadio Mané, Liverpool’s outstanding player, the initial chance and for a split-second it seemed as though Fernandinho might concede a penalty. Salah did not wait to find out. He was on the ball in a flash, swerving to the left of City’s goalkeeper, Ederson, before shaping his body for a tricky angled finish. He was an island of composure, floating in his 39th goal of the season with a delicate chip into the corner.Firmino’s goal came straight from Otamendi’s misplaced pass and, unfortunately for City, the defender’s faults have been a recurring theme against top-level opponents. Otamendi has chosen a bad week to produce his worst form but it is no coincidence that it has come in three games when opposition players have taken him on, knowing he can be vulnerable under pressure.Liverpool, on the other hand, refused to buckle when the pressure was rising dangerously close to intolerable. Raheem Sterling, in particular, was a constant menace in the first half and prominently involved in the opening goal, squaring the decisive pass for Jesus after Virgil van Dijk’s clearance had been cut out. Van Dijk was knocked off balance in the process but his appeals for a free-kick were futile. Jesus turned in Sterling’s pass and Liverpool’s night had suddenly become a lot more perilous.To put it into context the first half here was even more one-sided than the corresponding 45 minutes in Liverpool’s favour last week. The difference, of course, was that Liverpool scored three times at Anfield whereas City, with home advantage, found it harder to turn their early superiority into the hard currency of goals. Bernardo Silva crashed one shot off the post and Sané’s disallowed goal was a wretched piece of officiating because the ball came to him from a Liverpool player, James Milner, rather than one of his team-mates. Enraged, Guardiola strode on to the pitch at half-time to remonstrate with the Spanish referee, Antonio Mateu Lahoz, but went too far with his eyeballing and matador-like hand movements. He was “upstairs”, in the Colin Bell stand, to watch Liverpool’s second-half turnaround and a dismal seven days for City take another turn for the worse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e532467e517af16771a4e81b6a751338d2814e61/15_33_1468_881/master/1468.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=015a1f4d10cf7e2759e5bf6470b2d412 1240w","title":"manchester city pep guardiola champions league","story":"Pep Guardiola blamed decisions that went against Manchester City in both legs of the Champions League quarter-final as they were knocked out by Liverpool 5-1 on aggregate at the Etihad Stadium.“I said the ball came from Milner, he said: ‘Ah from Milner, the pass?’ ‘Yes from Milner and when it comes from Milner it is not offside.’“When you go to half-time at 2-0 against that side it is a bit different.

But it was McCarthy who grabbed the headlines after he was quizzed about the fans’ negative reaction to the 56th-minute substitution of debutant Barry Cotter.The former Republic of Ireland boss, who was already due to leave the club at the end of the season, retorted: “I won’t have to listen to that again, that’s my last game - I’m out of here.”His curt remark cut short his managerial career at Ipswich with four games to go in the Championship, with his relationship with some of the home fans reaching a low point.A spokesman for the club said he made the decision to leave the club along with his assistant Terry Connor on Sunday, following the 1-0 away defeat against Brentford, and plans are being made to put in a replacement until the end of the season.The Blues boss, who announced at the end of March he would be leaving his role in the summer, gave a three-minute press conference at the end of the game before revealing he was leaving.Reacting to boos when young defender Cotter was substituted in the second half, McCarthy said: “It was a disgraceful reaction, that, but I won’t have to listen to it again because that’s my last game. I’m out of here.”With that he banged the desk and departed, with the club then confirming the news on their website and Twitter feed.“I spoke with Marcus (Evans, owner) at the weekend and we agreed that it was in the best interests for me, the players and the club that I move on now,” McCarthy said in the website story.“I said I would see the season out but it’s been a new experience and it’s not one I have been enjoying to be honest.“I have continued to do my job to the best of my ability but there is something missing and I’m not comfortable with that.“I have had a great time here and worked with some great people and to all those who have given me wonderful support over the last five and a half years - and there are many - I want to put on record my personal thanks.“The players here can look forward to a new challenge with whoever comes in and I want to wish them, the staff and the club the best of fortunes.”McCarthy was linked with his hometown club Barnsley before the appointment of Jose Morais, who saw his side’s hopes of Championship survival take a hit with Tuesday’s result.Morais said: “It’s a defeat and there’s nothing more than to move on. All the games are big games and must-win games and we expected this game to be a must-win game. It was a difficult game, I don’t expect it to be easy, but I expect us to have the ability to win.“We created chances and we had the chances to lead the game and the confidence still exists in the team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa40e8c5cee277d28e74e298cdc5a36fd4837961/31_0_4196_2517/master/4196.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=37b3a4fdbd8e418283c35e5924a126b8 1240w","title":"roma barcelona champions league quarter final match report","story":"The celebrations went on so long that for a while it seemed Roma’s incredulous supporters would never go home. The sea of red, white and yellow flags in the Curva Sud were lifted with pride, strangers were hugging each other and the anthems floating around the Roman air were still being belted out a good 20 minutes after the conclusion of one of the most remarkable comebacks in the history of the Champions League.It had been an extraordinary occasion, with one glance off the head of Kostas Manolas in the 82nd minute sparking scenes of pure elation among the locals, and nobody should criticise Roma for reacting as if they had just become the champions of Europe. They achieved something extraordinary, defying the odds on a wild night at the Stadio Olimpico by overhauling a 4-1 deficit to Barcelona from the first leg, and how the underdogs cherished reaching the semi-finals for the first time since 1984.Barcelona had nowhere to hide. Last year they stunned Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16, advancing despite being thrashed 4-0 in the first leg, but the shoe was on their leaden foot this time. They were reduced to such a state of disarray that even Lionel Messi was booked for cynically hacking at Aleksandar Kolarov and Ernesto Valverde’s sluggish team could have no complaints about their third consecutive quarter-final exit, even though Roma tortured their fans by leaving it late and almost blew it when a defensive mix-up presented Ousmane Dembélé with an opportunity to rescue La Liga’s champions-elect.His chip drifted over Alisson Becker’s unguarded goal, however, and the truth is that Barcelona, so insipid until they were behind, deserved to go out. They will be no great loss on this evidence, even if neutrals will mourn Messi’s absence from the last four, and no condescension should be aimed at Roma given that Eusebio Di Francesco’s fearless team finished top of a group that contained Atlético Madrid and Chelsea and beat Shakhtar Donetsk in the last 16. Nothing summed up their defiance more than the players who got their second and third goals. Daniele De Rossi and Manolas both scored at the wrong end in the first leg, leaving Roma with an enormous challenge, but they chose the perfect way to respond, standing tall while their opponents cowered.Roma, fourth in Serie A, had leaders all over the pitch. “Mission Impossible” was the headline on the front of Gazzetta dello Sport and even the most devoted follower of I Giallorossi could have been forgiven for thinking Barcelona’s advantage was too imposing. Only 11 sides had recovered after losing the first leg by three goals or more in this competition’s 63-year history and Roma faced opponents who had the safety net of Messi’s genius.But with red smoke billowing out of the brilliantly boisterous Curva Sud and the noise deafening, the hosts wasted no time exposing the frailties in Barcelona’s defence. Alessandro Florenzi’s long pass in the sixth minute was perfectly flighted and the outstanding Edin Dzeko, who had kept the tie alive with his artful poaching in the first leg, bustled Jordi Alba and Samuel Utiti aside before rolling the ball past Marc-André ter Stegen.Valverde will be criticised for his defensive focus. He opted for pragmatism, starting Sergi Roberto and waiting until the 85th minute to introduce Dembélé and Paulinho, and still Barcelona were overwhelmed in midfield, where De Rossi, Radja Nainggolan and Kevin Strootman were powerful, creative and dominant. Luis Suárez’s only noteworthy contribution was picking up a booking for timewasting and it was strange to think that Barcelona remain unbeaten in the league given how reliant they have become on Messi.Alisson was protected by his back three and the damage for Barcelona would have been more severe at half-time if Patrik Schick had shown greater precision with two free headers or Dzeko had snuck another effort past Ter Stegen.The question at the start of the second half was whether Roma would tire after such a frenzied effort. It felt as though any dip in intensity would prove costly, especially when Barcelona began to exert a measure of control in midfield, with Sergio Busquets, Andrés Iniesta and Ivan Rakitic showing signs of gathering their thoughts.The clock was Roma’s enemy. Yet the mood changed when Strootman hounded Iniesta out of possession in the 55th minute, allowing Schick to run at Umtiti. The forward tumbled and appealed in vain for a penalty but Roma had found a second wind and moments later Dzeko was outmuscling Gerard Piqué, turning and preparing to shoot from close range. Piqué’s foul was desperate and this time Clement Turpin, the French referee, awarded a penalty that De Rossi sent past Ter Stegen.It was a cathartic moment for the Roma captain, whose team had more than 30 minutes to find the conclusive breakthrough. They tore forward, Ter Stegen saving from Nainggolan and Stephan El Shaarawy, De Rossi heading just wide, and they breathed a sigh of relief when Messi shot straight at Alisson from 18 yards.That was a reminder of Barça’s lingering threat, yet Roma were far more enterprising and, when Manolas darted to the near post to meet Kolarov’s corner, they were all off the bench to join in the manic celebrations. Even the ball boys were involved. For Roma there were memories to last a lifetime."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9a6ab4b434e1c5efc6cca274a312846ca0fb9b1/0_170_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=db1e6e0aab169a3f51cc262cea88cdec 1240w","title":"manchester city v liverpool champions league quarter final second leg live","story":"Liverpool survived a torrid first half to ease into the semi-finals through goals from Mo Salah and Roberto FirminoLiverpool are through to the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in a decade.

Salah’s goal was a devastating sucker punch at a time when City were miles ahead on all three judges’ scorecards.66 min A Manchester City substitution: David Silva is replaced by Sergio Aguero.65 min Mane skins Laporte by the right touchline, only to bisect Firmino and Mane with his cut back. That was another chance for Liverpool. City break and Van Dijk is booked for a perceived foul on Sterling. Not sure he did much wrong.63 min That Salah goal was such a savage plot twist that, for the time being, City’s heads have gone. Liverpool have had more promising attacks in the last 10 minutes than they did in the first 50.61 min City have been grieving for the last five minutes, running round without their usual purpose. De Bruyne tries to snap them out of it with a long-range shot that is easily saved by Karius.60 min The mood of the match has changed completely. Salah drives a brilliant long pass to Firmino, who gets the wrong side of Walker but dithers just long enough for Ederson to come out and claim the ball. That was a good chance. 58 min As you almost certainly know, Manchester City now need to score four goals to go through.That was such a cool finish. Mane surged into the area onto Salah’s pass and fell over after a challenge from Fernandinho. While everyone looked to see if a penalty would be given, Salah picked up the loose ball, danced around Ederson and dinked the ball gently over Otamendi on the line. That is just a sensational goal.The little genius has done it again!56 min A few of you have emailed to say that Ederson should have been sent off for repeatedly shoving Mane. He did act the goat, that’s undeniable, but I still think a yellow card was correct. Mind you, I haven’t read the Laws of the Game from cover to cover for at least a fortnight, so I’m a bit rusty.55 min Firmino, who has already been booked, gets away with a strong shoulder-to-shoulder challenge on the breaking De Bruyne. I think that was the right decision. But had a foul been given, Firmino might have been sent off.53 min It’s been a slightly weird game in that, although Liverpool have been absolutely battered, their keeper hasn’t had any difficult saves to make."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8db8c41674a7c13bc8e9e11a91c9a711fc7783c0/0_128_1926_1156/master/1926.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1cc6c9c38f08417ee2cbc69ae732ec00 1240w","title":"roma v barcelona champions league quarter final second leg live","story":"Roma have their Romatada!

What a performance by the hosts. Roma are in wonderland!90+3 min: Dzeko, who has been superb all night, wins a freekick deep in Barcelona territory. The crowd acclaim him as if he’s netted a hat-trick.90+2 min: Chaos at the back for Roma! becker rushes out of his box to intercept a ball over the top after th ref waved play on despite mass Roma appeals for offside. The ball breaks to Dembele, who lifts it over the stranded keeper from 30 yards .... and it drops just over the bar!90 min: Barcelona have at least four minutes to find the goal that would save their hides and break Roman hearts.89 min: Roma are living on the edge now. Barcelona are applying serious pressure at last. Messi skedaddles down the right and cuts back on to his left foot. He spots Suarez on the fr side of the box and pings the ball over to him. Suarez chops back and tries to curl a shot into the far corner, but Jesus is Roma’s saviour with a strong block.88 min: Alba flips a lovely pass to Messi, who flashes a low ball across the face of goal. Manolas is again in the way: he’s not about to let anyone deny him his status as match-winner! 87 min: Barcelona launch a couple of long balls into the Roma box. When tikki-taka fails, there’s always hoofery.86 min: Dembele’s first involvement is a low cross from the right that Manolas turns behind for a corner. It’s humped into the box. Roma struggle to clear. it bobbles around the box. Messi pounces on it and forces his way past two defenders and to within six yards of goal ... but he never quite has the ball under control, and Becker is able to rush out and intercept!Barcelona substitutions: Dembélé and Alcaer on, Busquets and Semedo off. Barcelona have five minutes plus stoppage time to score the goal that they have not looked like scoring at all so far.83 min: The Stadio Olimpico erupts as Manolas rushes to the home dugout, where he is engulfed by dozens of team-mates, staff and balls boys! Scenes!The greek defender sends a glancing six-yard header into the net from a corner! 82 min: If Barcelona succeed in hanging on here, everyone will want them in the semi-final, not least Liverpool, who would demolish them.Barcelona substitution: Gomes on, Iniesta off after exerting little influence amid the Roma whirlwind.79 min: Roma launch another counter-attack. Florenzi chops back on to his left foot and flights a dinky ball from the right beyond the far post. El Sharaawy stretches out a leg and turns it towards goal from three yards. Ter Stegen makes a superb reflex save to bat it away! A gasp goes around the ground!78 min: Barcelona have summoned some gumption at last and are zipping the ball around in a way that is irritating Roma, who just want to get it back so that they can tear forward anew.75 min: Ter Stegen kicks the ball downfield. Suarez and Jesus challenge for it. The defender’s arm brushes Suarez, who takes that as a cue to flop the grass and appeal for medical and referee intervention. The ref isn’t buying his act but Barça do, at least, get a breather. 74 min: Messi has a pop from the edge of the area. He gets good power on it despite minimal backlift. but Becker clasps it to his chest. Roma substitution: Under on, Schick off, no doubt knackered after a sterling performance. Just before that change took place, Suarez was booked for wasting time.71 min: Roma are channeling the spirit of the Metz team of 1984. I wonder, if Roma complete the job, which player will ask Messi where his ham is? (Read this to get that) 69 min: So close! De Rossi gets his head to a cross from the left ... but nods inches wide from six yards! 68 min: A Roma player lofts a hopeful ball into the box. Nainggolan gets to it first and, while leaning back, tries to sidefoot a volley into the net from 12 yards. It’s a decent effort but straight at the keeper. “If, and that is a huge if, Roma could pull off the win, can we call it ‘Romantada’?” quips RS Naveen. You sure can. And you might well get the chance to use it. I’d make Roma favourites at this point.66 min: Barcelona have a freekick near half-way. They try to run down the clock ...63 min: Messi pulls down Kolarov and is booked. That tells you all you need to know about how things are going. 62 min: The other three semi-finalists will be hoping Barcelona hang on here. Because, despite the scoreline, the evidence of the tie so far is that Roma would be more formidable opponents.59 min: The atmosphere in the Stadio Olimpico is absolutely intoxicating: the locals sense their team is on the verge of a historic comeback. And their players continue to bully Barça all over the pitch!De Rossi, who scored an own goal in the first leg, places a fine spotkick into the corner. One more goal and Roma will go through (provided they don’t concede). Barça are clinging on!Dzeko - brilliant all night - was pulled down by Pique after outmuscling the defender. The ref initially didn’t give it but, perhaps after advice from an assistant, eventually points to the spot. It’s the correct decision.56 min: Roma’s pressing pays off again! Strootman wins the ball in midfield and quickly fees Schick, who hurls himself to the ground. 55 min: Semedo runs into Kolarov as the pair chases a pass down the left wing. The ref gives Barcelona a freekick. A lucky break for the Catalans, and a chance for some respite.52 min: Rakitic fees a useful pass into the right-hand channel to relieve the pressure Sergi Roberto chases after it. But he’s eased out of the way by Manolas, who quickly gets another counter-attacking going. Barcelona are out of their depth in terms of physicality.51min: Furious pressing by Roma: they’ve got that head of steam up again. Barcelona can’t get out of their half!49 min: Dzeko ks an excellent pass to Florenzi wide on the right. The winger delivers a testing cross. Ter Stegen watches it floated over him. But no Roma player can reach it at the far post.47 min: It’s been a good start to the second half by Barcelona. They haven’t threatened but they’re kept the ball pretty well, denying Roma any chance to work up another head of steam.46 min: The teams are ready to go again, with the same players as in the first half. But will Barça have found extra energy? If not, they could be toppled. That was a very good half from Roma. Their only regret will be that they did not score more. But they have Barcelona rattled and the comeback is still a real possibility.45 min: Jesus booked for clumping into Messi from behind.45 min: Rakitic tries to release Messi with a neat ball from deep. but Manolas read it and gets to the ball before the Argentinian marvel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbf9a28707fb4906f117ddb835e2f15cb952960f/0_238_2170_1302/master/2170.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4a1972be405d61bb310fda7a23f1ea7e 1240w","title":"10 years of lady gaga how she queered mainstream pop forever","story":"It’s a decade since Lady Gaga burst into the charts with Just Dance, and showed a new generation how to create a vivid identity for yourself, anywhereThe year is 2008. I sit on the floor of my family’s modest living room in a sleepy suburb in Ireland, my tongue contorting around my teeth in concentration as I apply a finishing layer of glitter to my masterpiece. It is my 14th year of life and also the 14th time in an hour that I’ve hit the replay button on my big sister’s CD player. A mere month before this scene, Lady Gaga had exploded out of obscurity – it is her image my younger self is reproducing in card and glitter, while Just Dance, released 10 years ago this week, loops in the background.In this moment, I already know that whatever is represented by this woman, this symbol, I love wholeheartedly. I know that she is the living embodiment of some ideal type that informs who I am. What I don’t yet know is that who I am is gay – and that my gayness will become inextricably intertwined over the course of my life with Gaga. She will become the background music in every gay club I will dance in, the overture to every drunken kiss, a talking point for every first date.Female pop icons have long formed a core part of gay culture, and much has been written about why. Some say we live vicariously through their sexuality more Freudian theories suggest they’re our surrogate mothers. Less controversially, one could simply say their bright pop ballads about overcoming love and loss have historically provided a light-hearted, strobe-lit, glittery escapism from a world darkened by the shadows of HIV and homophobia. Before Gaga there was Madonna, Cher, Diana Ross. You may think Gaga didn’t do anything over and above what these performers did: provide glamour and camp value. But the special place she carved in the hearts of gay people cannot be reduced to her penchant for changing wigs – Lady Gaga queered the mainstream.She emerged into a pop landscape staggeringly different to the one we inhabit in 2018. The pre-Gaga charts of 2007 were socially and politically sterile, thronged with such hetero banalities as Kaiser Chiefs and Timbaland. The closest we got to queer representation was the tasteless gay-baiting of Katy Perry’s I Kissed a Girl in 2008. We were at the zenith of an economic boom, unaware of the impending global economic catastrophe that would spark a period of political revolution to coincide with Gaga’s rise. Economic comfort meant that oppression was felt less keenly, that discourse was relaxed. For kids like me stagnating in small towns, in countries where gay marriage was still illegal and casual homophobia rife, the silence felt like the calm before the storm.Some would have disregarded the reactionary content of noughties charts and simply looked back to David Bowie, Prince and Boy George for revolutionary queer role models instead – they destabilised gender categories a decade before Gaga was born. But to my generation, these icons and their reassuring androgyny were out of reach. My childhood was an alienating cultural wasteland, where I survived on a diet of my parents’ Irish country music and my peers’ Top 40 pop. This was still the age of dial-up modems – for many pre-smartphone era queer kids, the likes of Bowie may as well not have existed.Consequently, Lady Gaga turned my world upside down. I suffered from chronic anxiety, linked to years of bullying. I was offensively effeminate and school was an ordeal spent avoiding older boys who spat “faggot” at me in the corridors. After Gaga exploded, I fashioned my own diamond-encrusted glasses and dyed my hair green – the slurs in the corridors lost their power when, like Gaga, I was deliberately provoking the attention. “What a freak,” my peers would scream at pictures of Gaga’s meat dress. I burned with defiance to hear them deride her – if she was a freak, this person I loved, then I didn’t want to be normal any more. The word “faggot” resounding in the corridor no longer marked me out as lesser, but placed me on a pedestal alongside my heroine, another freak – who happened to be No 1 in 20 countries. Her otherness made my own otherness feel more aspirational than painful. In a world of utter darkness, her presence was my only light, a wordless pathway to myself before I even knew what the word queer meant.Gaga did for my generation what Bowie did 20 years earlier. She re-queered a mainstream that had fallen back into heteronormative mundanity. She vocally defended the rights of LGBT people and spoke of her own bisexuality openly. In pop, she expanded what was palatable. She repopularised the flamboyant theatricality of outrageous costuming, on-stage bleeding and compulsive wig changes. She drew inspiration from Bowie’s lightning bolts, Alexander McQueen’s fashion, Leigh Bowery’s performance art, Prince’s androgyny. She performed in male drag, and forced us to question gender characteristics and human physicality with facial protrusions and prosthetic penises. She was the vanguard for a revival of queerness in pop culture that has left an astonishing legacy a decade later – one would hardly bat an eyelid now to hear a word such as “transgender” uttered in a chart-topping song, but before Born This Way the thought would have been startling. It is partly thanks to her that we now live in an era where RuPaul’s Drag Race is mainstream.In fact, Drag Race is perhaps the key to understanding what Gaga did for young queer people. When Gaga appeared as a host on the ninth series of the show, she entered posing as one of the contestants. It’s not insignificant that Gaga presented herself as a drag queen – that’s precisely what she has always been, and what she taught young queer people like me to be.Drag is about borrowing cultural references to construct a persona. When Gaga reinvented the revolutionary queer spirit of Bowie and Prince for the youth of the noughties, she was performing a drag of her own. She borrowed tropes to construct the persona that accrued her fame, figuratively lip-syncing along to the legacies of Cher, Madonna, and the stars she imitated. She invented Gaga in the same way that drag queens do their alter egos.Millions of young gay people in turn used her example to construct their own identities in small, alienating towns and villages around the world. Every person needs references to inform their social performance, to do a sort of drag in their daily lives. Gaga offered queer people those references that our heteronormative hometowns couldn’t, reaching back into the past and passing them forward to those of us who could not access them alone. She taught a new generation of young queer people how to drag up an identity out of a barrenness around them, by looking to history and pop culture. This is what gay people have always done – but many of my generation didn’t know how. Mine was a generation whose would-be mentors had been decimated by the HIV epidemic, causing a wealth of generational community knowledge to be lost forever a generation where cohesion in the real-world gay community was breaking down and gay spaces were closing.Gaga replaced my would-be mentors. When I mimicked her outrageous presentation, I was tapping into the references she offered to express a queerness that I was not yet able to put into words. Without her in the charts, many queer kids like me would have been left with no touchstones whatsoever. She taught us all to be drag queens in our own lives – as RuPaul says, “We’re all born naked, the rest is drag”. When Gaga came to host Drag Race 9, she was truly coming home. Her importance was summarised with beautiful simplicity when one of the contestants, Eureka, broke down, saying “you don’t realise what you do for people like us”.Ten years on, Gaga’s legacy is a changed world. For me, and many gay people around the globe, she is the icon of our generation, to whom we owe nothing less than our identities. Baby, there’s no other superstar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1354e6722e5d64f06234e94fc5455a27a8a842f7/0_0_6211_3727/master/6211.jpg?w=6000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1107848ad701d780d22d762227155593 12000w","title":"commonwealth uk brexit leaving eu","story":"As director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, I know what this institution does – and the notion that it can pick up the slack when the UK leaves the EU is nonsense. By  Philip Murphy‘So, Professor Murphy,” said the voice at the end of the line. “What does the Commonwealth mean to you?” It was 2014, and I had agreed to do a live interview about the Commonwealth for a radio talk show. Media interest had been sparked by the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, and while I waited, phone in hand, for my turn to speak, the presenter was busily soliciting Commonwealth-related thoughts from anyone he could find on Glasgow’s streets that morning.Finally, just as the clock was ticking towards the very end of the show, the presenter turned his attentions to me. But I was stumped by the question. What does the Commonwealth mean to me? It was only since I had become director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies (ICwS) a few years earlier that it had “meant” anything much at all. And what was that meaning? Lots of drinks receptions in the hollowed-out citadels of Britain’s former imperial power? Endless well-meaning conferences exploring how the Commonwealth could achieve its “true potential”?In the three-and-a-half seconds while all this was racing through my head, the presenter correctly anticipated that a cheery anecdote would not be forthcoming, and moved on to the more concrete question: “What does the Commonwealth actually do?” I blurted out something spectacularly feeble along the lines of: “Well, it doesn’t do very much, but then it doesn’t cost very much.” And that was it – straight into the 10 o’clock news and traffic roundup. Not my finest hour.With the Commonwealth Games taking place at the moment and the biennial Commonwealth heads of government meeting opening in London next week, my institute will again be fielding a high volume of press enquiries. And this time, I’ll be ready for the “What does it mean to you?” question. Back in 2014, I wasn’t. But it was a variant of another question that I had regularly been asked in the five years since I became director of the ICwS: “How did you become interested in the Commonwealth?” There was always an assumption that some element of my upbringing or family history must have sparked my interest in this unique organisation, one that is very largely made up of former parts of the British empire. It currently has 53 members, including Britain itself, which range in size from India, with a population of more than 1.3 billion people, to the tiny Pacific island states of Tuvalu and Nauru, with populations of about 11,000 and 13,000 respectively. But there was nothing I could really point to. I grew up in Hull. Very occasionally we did go overseas on family holidays – but only to the Isle of Man. I can’t remember anyone even mentioning Commonwealth Day while I was at school in the 1970s and 80s. Had they been fee-paying public schools, where a good smattering of the families would probably have had records of imperial service, the situation might have been different. But they most decidedly were not.Later, as a postgraduate student studying how the Conservative party reacted to the decolonisation of Africa, I became familiar with the idea of the Commonwealth as a great, soothing comfort blanket for the party’s dwindling band of post-second world war imperial enthusiasts. They could reassure themselves that the sad business of granting independence to British colonies wasn’t really the end of the line. Like the souls of the faithful departed, these countries would simply join the heavenly throng of the Commonwealth and live in eternal peace and harmony.For the next 20 years or so, insofar as I thought about the Commonwealth, it was largely as a relatively minor aspect of British foreign policy. During the postwar period, the organisation had moved from being seen as an essential prop of Britain’s “great power” status to representing a puzzle, then an irritant, and finally a constant source of disappointment. It has maintained a loyal band of supporters, mostly concentrated in a series of London-based affiliated organisations. Yet even they often seem unable to provide any very convincing reasons for their enthusiasm.Suddenly, people started to talk about the Commonwealth again. The trouble was that most of what they were saying was nonsense.In the weeks after Britain voted for Brexit, as I tried to come to terms with what seemed to me an unmitigated disaster, there were always sympathetic friends on hand to make matters worse. “You’re at the centre of things now,” they said. “You must be very busy. Apparently the Commonwealth is the way of the future.” To which, as the director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, my response was: “If the Commonwealth is the future, then we’re in even more trouble than I thought.”Despite the leave campaign’s best efforts to turn the Commonwealth into a symbol of Britain’s ability to stand on the international stage independently of the EU, its power and influence has long been on the wane. Just a year before the Brexit referendum, the party manifestos for the UK general election reflected the Commonwealth’s diminished importance. In place of Labour’s 1997 vow to give renewed priority to this “unique network of contacts linked by history, language and legal systems”, the party now barely mentioned it. The Conservatives were a little more forthcoming, although they largely cut and pasted the words from their 2010 document. Ukip, predictably, scattered in references far more frequently than anyone else. Yet even they had dropped a startlingly ambitious proposal that had featured in its 2010 manifesto, to establish “a Commonwealth Free Trade Area” with the other Commonwealth countries.So, how exactly did it manage to shuffle its way back into the political conversation? For the leave campaign, depicting the Commonwealth as a huge potential trading opportunity for the UK was a useful fiction. This was reassuring mood music for a campaign keen to demonstrate that Britain would not be left helpless and isolated after Brexit. Yet beyond a few hand-me-down figures about its supposed economic potential, there were few clues about how or why the volume of trade with Commonwealth member states would be increased.Although the Commonwealth featured as an element in the snake oil sold to voters by the leave campaign, it was by no means the most potent ingredient. Indeed, many Brexiters struggled with the whole concept of the Commonwealth. On the one hand, it fed into their arguments that Britain had the opportunity to engage more actively with growing economies outside the EU. But it also sat uneasily within a campaign that had focused sharply on the issue of immigration.Once the result was announced, some of Britain’s most prominent Commonwealth enthusiasts began celebrating. Less than a week after the vote, the Daily Telegraph carried an article by David Howell, then chairman of the Royal Commonwealth Society, under the headline “A bright future awaits Britain post-Brexit in the Commonwealth markets”. It rehearsed a series of arguments that had been regularly trotted out for two decades, including the idea of a “Commonwealth advantage” in terms of the ease and cost of trade, and the notion that the world’s future growth areas would be outside the EU: “It is to Asia, Africa and Latin America we need to look for the big prizes, and the Commonwealth network is the gateway to many of these fast-growing new economies,” Lord Howell wrote.Given the ever more certain prospect that we will, indeed, leave the EU, it is worth looking closely at whether there is anything to this view. The origins of Howell’s argument go back to a brief and not very well-substantiated 1994 article by the Australian scholar Katherine West, titled “Britain, the Commonwealth and the Global Economy”, which was published in the the Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs. The piece began with the proposition that, for the UK, Europe had “become an economic black spot, with double-digit unemployment and the lowest rates of growth in the developed world”. It suggested that the British government’s “Eurocentric political rhetoric” tended to disguise the importance to Britain of markets outside the EU. West then moved to note “the spectacular economic growth” of Asian markets, suggesting again that “myopic concentration” on Europe on the part of British policymakers was an impediment to the exploitation of these markets.Tony Blair’s New Labour government, which took office in May 1997, initially seemed keen to run with this idea. The UK was about to host a Commonwealth heads of government meeting for the first time in 20 years, and the idea of the Commonwealth as an instrument to promote British trade seemed a useful way of fitting this rather creaking institution into New Labour’s modernising agenda.This new commercially minded love affair between the Blair government and the Commonwealth was, however, fairly shortlived. In the short term, Blair himself seemed disillusioned from virtually his first sight of the Commonwealth in action, irritated by the drawn-out and inconclusive nature of the Edinburgh Commonwealth heads of government meeting. In the longer term, and particularly after 911, Blair’s attentions focused on Anglo-American relations and the Middle East.Nevertheless, it was clear that promoting the notion of the Commonwealth as an under-utilised business asset was a way of persuading the British government to take it seriously. During the next two decades, bodies such as the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Commonwealth Business Council and the Commonwealth Secretariat pushed the idea vigorously. In particular, they suggested that there was a “Commonwealth effect” that rendered intra-Commonwealth trade cheaper and easier – an idea that can be traced directly to West’s 1994 article.These figures are now regularly rehearsed at Commonwealth gatherings, but there has been little objective analysis of this report, and we might well be cautious in reading too much into them. First, as the study notes, there are wide variations in the extent to which inidual Commonwealth countries trade with others. For some, the proportion is relatively low. The UK and Canada are mentioned in this context as countries “positioned close to large non-Commonwealth markets”. By contrast, there are other member states, including Singapore and Malaysia, that enjoy greater geographical proximity to major Commonwealth trading partners, and so conduct a much higher proportion of intra-Commonwealth trade. Given this, and the fact that there are huge variations in the levels of trade conducted by inidual member states, it is difficult to see what we can actually learn from an average figure for “Commonwealth advantage” between two notional Commonwealth states.It is worth noting, too, that in the run-up to the referendum, Commonwealth member states were virtually as one in wishing Britain to remain part of the EU. Behind this uncharacteristic outbreak of unanimity is the simple fact that Brexit throws the UK’s future trading relationships into confusion. The working assumption is that the current EU agreements, which allow many developing Commonwealth countries access to the UK market on advantageous terms, will lapse in Britain at the moment that Brexit takes effect. It will only be after that point that the UK has the legal capacity to negotiate trade agreements independently of the EU.This means many less-developed Commonwealth countries that currently conduct a significant proportion of their trade with the UK risk being hit by an immediate tariff hike. Given the finite resources available to the UK government for complex trade negotiations, and that attention is likely to be focused on the more lucrative markets of Europe, Asia and North America, Commonwealth countries quite reasonably fear that they will be a relatively low priority for Brexit Britain. The UK is also a major contributor to the EU aid budget, from which many Commonwealth countries benefit, and British overseas dependencies face the prospect of losing access to this important source of development funding altogether.In October 2010, Michael Ancram – then the former Conservative shadow foreign secretary – published a pamphlet setting out a new agenda for British foreign policy. The document, titled Farewell to Drift: A New Foreign Policy for a Network World, showed the influence of David Howell’s worldview: the forces of globalisation were steadily undermining the significance of old-fashioned power blocs such as the EU. Conversely, the Commonwealth, with its lack of treaty or constitution and its emphasis on collaboration and mutual support, was “a readymade vehicle for positive action”.“For too long the Commonwealth has been under-funded and underappreciated by many of its members, including the UK,” Ancram wrote. “For us it costs only 20p per person per year, while the EU costs £52 per person per year. It urgently needs, with British help, encouragement and involvement to become a bolder organisation that recognises its own strengths. It could have associate members as well as new members indeed some of the giants of the world like Japan could become interested, especially if it is based in the emerging powerhouse of India. It is in our interest to encourage such countries to become involved in the Commonwealth in one way or another.”During the 2016 referendum campaign, Ancram duly pinned his colours firmly to the leave mast. His encomium nicely encapsulated many elements of the British myth of the Commonwealth. This includes the tension between wishing to use the organisation more effectively, and disavowing any wish to lead it. Ancram was not the first Commonwealth enthusiast to recommend moving its headquarters to India, the most populous member state – but, more than seven years since the publication of his pamphlet, that prospect is no less remote. With many members of India’s policymaking elite seeing the Commonwealth as little more than a quaint relic of British imperialism, there is little chance of them offering it this sort of flag of convenience. There was also something familiar in Ancram’s ambiguous contrast between the supposed 20p cost of the Commonwealth, against the EU’s £52. Were we supposed to conclude that the Commonwealth is better value for money, or simply that it is under-resourced?Commonwealth enthusiasts generally want to have it both ways: the Commonwealth has supposedly vast potential (thus the idea of Japan joining as an associate member), which could be augmented further with a little additional funding, yet membership will always remain cheaper than the EU, and not only in terms of the UK’s direct financial contribution. Somehow, this mythical Commonwealth of the future will cost less than the EU in terms of the vast number of hours required to negotiate its treaties and other formal agreements it will not require members to make significant concessions in return for some collective good and it will have only the most rudimentary of mechanisms to enforce its will.In this light, the Commonwealth is the international relations equivalent of a homeopathic remedy – a cadre of staff so small as to be almost invisible when dissolved across a body comprising 2.4 billion people, which nevertheless does or could achieve miraculous results. But the promise of the Commonwealth can be seen in another, arguably far more realistic way. It is based on the prospect offered by charlatans and quacks throughout the ages – that of something for nothing.In the decades since the second world war, the process of devising and agreeing mechanisms for European cooperation has indeed been time-consuming and expensive. But it has resulted in a series of concrete achievements, above all the creation of the world’s largest free-trading bloc. Decisions made at an EU level affect the texture of daily life in its member states in the way that the Commonwealth’s empty pronouncements do not. As a result, any contemporary survey of international relations since 1945 is likely to devote considerable space to the EU and little or none to the Commonwealth. Frankly, the EU matters, in a way that the Commonwealth does not.This has long been apparent to those within the UK government who engage directly with the Commonwealth. It is far less obvious, however, to the vast majority of people in the UK, who know the organisation largely through occasional high-profile events such as the Commonwealth Games, and through the annual round-robin delivered in the Queen’s speech. It is at this level, and in this specifically British context, that the myth of the Commonwealth is arguably most dangerous. It encourages perceptions of the organisation as some sort of genuine global network with the UK at its centre, the other members ready to fall into line and embrace the prodigal mother whenever Britain finally decides that it is time to resume a guiding role.It was this combination of a widespread unfamiliarity with how the modern Commonwealth actually functions, and a lingering sense that it is in some way a special asset to the UK, that allowed some in the leave camp to present it during the 2016 referendum campaign as a direct alternative to the EU. This was despite the fact that the vast majority of Commonwealth members, and indeed the secretary general, Patricia Scotland, emphasised that membership of both organisations was not only wholly compatible but also mutually beneficial. The referendum result marked the point when the Commonwealth ceased to be simply a puzzle in Whitehall – an itch the civil service didn’t quite know how or where to scratch – and became a contributory factor in, arguably, Britain’s greatest foreign policy disaster since the end of the second world war.What, then, should be the basis of the UK’s future relationship with the Commonwealth? It could be argued that the referendum result has already ordained that this relationship will be an ever-closer one. But I doubt that. Brexit is unlikely to enhance British trade with Commonwealth countries. Indeed, in the short term, it might actually reduce it, as the UK struggles to replicate deals already in place under its EU membership. There may be closer trading and diplomatic relations with Australia and New Zealand, which represent the acceptable face of the organisation to those leave supporters who continue to regard the citizens of the notional white Commonwealth as “kith and kin”. But when it comes to the genuinely vast potential of the Indian market, a UK government driven by the anti-immigration agenda of leave voters is unlikely to make great strides in that direction. For example, India seems likely to want a relaxation of visa restrictions on its nationals in return for trade liberalisation. Certainly, the issue of immigration overshadowed Theresa May’s visit there in November 2016, leading to accusations that the UK wanted India’s business, but not its people. And whatever the future holds, invoking the name of the Commonwealth is unlikely to oil the wheels of any trade deal.As the Commonwealth summit in London approaches, get ready to hear about the long list of good causes – from ending war and poverty to tackling climate change, and from spreading democracy to promoting gender equality – that the organisation champions. All of this is, indeed, laudable. But given the Commonwealth’s record in recent years, one would need a great deal of faith and a remarkably short memory to believe that the organisation really can make a significant contribution in any of these areas. What is surely beyond doubt is that the Commonwealth cannot rescue the UK from the grievous, self-inflicted wound of Brexit. And any suggestion that it can will only serve to rob the organisation of whatever last vestiges of credibility it still possesses.Adapted from The Empire’s New Clothes: The Myth of the Commonwealth by Philip Murphy, published by Hurst on 19 April• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c2c6cc3e19ffa370cae85b4d0d13dc9f435f0d/0_0_4582_2651/master/4582.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d5435717d0eeed94f94db26f4d7b7e83 2020w","title":"labour minister barry gardiner sorry good friday agreement shibboleth","story":"Barry Gardiner ‘fully supports’ party over six tests for judging exit deal, claims Corbyn’s officeLabour has said that the party’s international trade secretary spokesman, Barry Gardiner, “fully supports” the party’s Brexit policy, after it emerged that he had described one of Keir Starmer’s six tests for judging the final deal as “bollocks”.Shortly after Gardiner apologised for claiming the Good Friday agreement was a “shibboleth”, whose importance was being exaggerated, a fresh recording emerged of the same private meeting in Brussels.Starmer, the party’s Brexit spokesman, has repeatedly demanded that any deal achieves “the exact same benefits” as the current relationship with the European Union. It was one of six tests set a year ago, just before article 50 was triggered, setting the negotiations in progress.Gardiner is recorded ridiculing the proposal. “It’s bollocks. Always has been bollocks” – and goes on to dismiss the whole strategy of the six tests.“We know very well that we cannot have the exact same benefits. And it would have made sense, because it was the Tories that said they were going to secure the exact same benefits, and our position should have been precisely to say: ‘They have said that they will secure the exact same benefits and we are going to hold them to that standard.’”He is also heard questioning the value of the “meaningful vote” on the deal that Labour MPs fought for, and saying, “any politician who tells you what’s going to happen … around that final deal is lying to you”.The comments were regarded by some in the shadow cabinet as a deliberate attempt to wreck Labour’s carefully negotiated position on Brexit.Starmer was furious, and complained to Jeremy Corbyn, having already raised objections to the “shibboleth” remarks. Corbyn later said his office had “had a conversation” with Gardiner.A spokesman said on Tuesday, “Labour has set six tests for the final Brexit deal. Those include holding the government to its own commitment to deliver the same benefits as the single market and customs union. We have been clear that, if those tests are not met, Labour will not back it in parliament. Barry Gardiner fully supports that position.”Gardiner then pours scorn on the idea of holding a “meaningful vote” in parliament on the final deal – Labour’s proudest achievement during the passage of the bill.“You tell me what a meaningful vote is? Is a meaningful vote one where you have alternatives and you reject one and you opt for the other. If so, what are the alternatives? … What we’re going to have is, at best, clarity about the orce settlement.”The remarks underlined concerns about how the party will handle the vote, expected in the autumn, after the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, appeared to suggest the deal would be so vague Labour could back it.Gardiner suggested that if parliament voted against the deal, the most likely result would be the downfall of Theresa May, but even that would not resolve anything.“What is the new prime minister, the new leader of the Conservative party going to be able to do as a result of that parliamentary vote? Do they go back and try to renegotiate a different deal in Europe? Well there’s no time for that. Do they hold a general election?”Labour has not formally addressed the question of what should happen if the deal is unacceptable to the Commons.Corbyn sacked Owen Smith as shadow Northern Ireland secretary last month after he publicly broke with Labour’s policy to advocate a referendum on the final Brexit deal.Smith said, “Barry’s not talking bollocks when he says that Brexit cannot deliver the exact same benefits as we currently enioy. Of course it can’t. That’s why it’s so wrong for Labour to merely try and water down Brexit. It will make our country and our constituents worse off and it will jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland.”Earlier on Tuesday, as dignitaries gathered in Northern Ireland on Tuesday to mark the peace deal’s 20th anniversary, Gardiner apologised for remarks that emerged earlier, about the “shibboleth” of the Good Friday agreement, saying, “I am deeply sorry that my informal remarks in a meeting last month have led to misunderstanding.”He apologised in particular for the use of the word “shibboleth”, which he acknowledged “gave the impression that I thought the Good Friday agreement was in any way outdated or unimportant. I absolutely do not.”Corbyn was also forced to repeat his commitment to ensuring there was no hard border. “There must be no return to a hard border between north and south, and no return to the horrors of the Troubles. All of us on both sides of the Irish Sea have a responsibility to maintain hope for the future.”Marking the anniversary, Corbyn paid tribute to the architects of the agreement, which he called “a defining moment in Irish history, which allowed peace to prevail”.Labour MP Chris Leslie, who supports the Open Britain campaign against Brexit, said Gardiner had “trashed the central point of Keir Starmer’s Brexit policy – the pledge to vote against any final Brexit deal that didn’t offer ‘the exact same benefits’”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fd20cf6810e9f13284cd8e0853b6e451b136396/0_0_5854_3513/master/5854.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=13dacaadca99cd9567fa796de101a078 1240w","title":"save the children inquiry staff misconduct brendan cox","story":"Move follows complaints about employees’ behaviour in Haiti and exit of senior staff membersSave the Children, the global charity mired in allegations that it failed to investigate sexual abuse and inappropriate behaviour by staff, is to be formally investigated by the Charity Commission. In a statement announcing a statutory inquiry, the commission said it had been prompted by “concerns about the charity’s handling, reporting and response to serious allegations of misconduct and harassment against senior staff members in 2012 and 2015”.The commission describes a statutory inquiry as its “most serious form of engagement” with a charity. The news, announced on Tuesday night, will be another blow for the charity two months after it emerged that both Justin Forsyth, its former chief executive, and Brendan Cox, the former policy director and widower of the MP Jo Cox, left the charity in 2015 following allegations of misconduct. The two men knew each other from their years working for Gordon Brown and the Labour party.After he left Save the Children, Forsyth went on to a senior role at Unicef. He resigned in February after the reports of inappropriate behaviour emerged. Cox also resigned from the charities More in Common and the Jo Cox Foundation, set up in the aftermath of his wife’s murder.The commission, which itself has been criticised for failing to follow up allegations involving the charities it polices, has been working with Save the Children since the facts about Forsyth and Cox emerged in the wake of the scandal involving Oxfam workers in Haiti.Save the Children is already reviewing its workplace culture and the implementation of recommendations made by a previous review. But the Charity Commission said its recent work with it, and new information from other sources that has recently come into the regulator’s possession, meant that the commission wanted to make further inquiries.It says it is concerned about how the 2015 allegations were reported to the commission, and how other complaints were handled and reviewed. It also questions “the charity’s decision-making since February 2018 on its public position regarding these allegations”.In wording that suggests that new witnesses may have come forward, the statement says the investigation will look at the frankness of the charity’s disclosure to the commission of “serious incidents relating to staffing matters”. However, the investigation is only into the management of the charity itself, not its charitable work. It will take place in private, hearing evidence from staff, past and present and any other witnesses, and examining documentation. It will be conducted by the commission’s investigations and enforcement unit, headed by Michelle Russell. But charity law is intended to ensure that charities serve their beneficiaries, and although the report will be published, the commission has no power of sanction. A spokesman emphasised that the decision to open a statutory investigation did not mean it had established any evidence of wrongdoing. It carried out more than 100 such inquiries last year. In February, Save the Children’s current chief executive, Kevin Watkins, announced a “root and branch review” of the charity’s organisational culture, including measures to preserve staff safety and “any behavioural challenges among senior leadership”. The charity said the review would commence by the end of this week and that it would report its findings in June. The final report will be “published, shared with the Charity Commission and made available to government and every single member of staff”.In evidence to a House of Commons committee at the time, Watkins said Save the Children dealt with 193 child protection and 35 sexual harassment cases involving allegations against its staff around the world last year. He told the international development select committee that the misconduct cases in 120 countries led to 30 dismissals.A Save the Children spokesman said: “We apologise for any pain these matters have caused and sincerely hope that the complainants feel able to help us with the review in the coming weeks. “This is so that we can better support our skilled and highly valued staff as they help change the lives of millions of children around the world every day.” As the scandal threatened the vital work of numerous charities, the heads of 22 aid organisations took the unprecedented step of apologising for the sector’s failure to tackle sexual abuse. They vowed to toughen safeguards against misconduct.The letter, signed by the heads of ActionAid UK, Christian Aid, Cafod, Care International UK, as well as Oxfam, Save the Children and others, said: “We are truly sorry.”The scandal has been blamed for last month’s Sport Relief event raising a third less than expected on the night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ce3d261e4aa79df29658e0b3518ac6c97dc00b/108_308_4746_2847/master/4746.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0b628563168bfa706c347946099f3921 1240w","title":"caster semenya 1500m gold commonwealth games gold coast","story":"• Brittany McGowan: ‘It’s tough for a lot of women in the 1500m’• Isaac Makwala blitzes the field to win gold in men’s 400mCaster Semenya’s strongest opposition on the way to winning Commonwealth gold came from a faulty starter’s gun which left the women contesting the 1500m final struggling to stay warm on the start line.A deluge of rain before the race soaked the track at the Carrara Stadium and flooded the timing equipment. As organisers struggled to repair the clock and gun, the South African bounced on the spot in an effort to keep her muscles warm.The 1500m, the final event of the day’s athletics, eventually got under way 10 minutes behind schedule and Semenya was utterly dominant. She assumed a commanding position in the pack before executing her break with 300m to race, overtaking Kenya’s Beatrice Chepkoech, who finished second, with 150m left. Wales’s Melissa Courtney came third in 4min 03.44sec. Already double Olympic 800m champion, it is the first time Semenya has been to a Commonwealth Games and she performed a swan-like celebration after crossing the line in a Games record of 4:00.71.“As a middle-distance runner I have done enough for my collection but this is for me, country and for the youth, we are inspiring the youth, we just want to show them they can do it,” Semenya said. “It rained so it messed up the clocks so they had to make sure the clock was running. It wasn’t bad for me.”The 27-year-old will attempt to add the 800m title later this week but is running in the knowledge that a proposed change in rules concerning hyperandrogenic athletes may spell the end of her career.Semenya has hyperandrogenism, a medical condition most commonly affecting women that is characterised by heightened levels of male sex hormones, including testosterone. The IAAF, athletics’ world governing body, has stated it hopes to have revised rules in place by November which will restrict testosterone levels in female athletes. It could mean Semenya will face a decision on whether to take medication to inhibit her testosterone levels or stop competing at elite level.The Australian 800m runner Brittany McGowan added fuel to the debate around Semenya’s inclusion by suggesting her times and those of others competing in the same races as the South African should not be compared. “It’s a tough one,” McGowan said. “It’s tough for a lot of women in the 800m, 400m and 1500m at the moment to compare ourselves and be judged by our governing bodies on those times.”Scotland’s Eilish McColgan, coached by her mother Liz McColgan, who won gold at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland in 1990, could manage only sixth. “My mum said to me at 600, you need to be going. But the pace was so fast, I was already going,” she said. “I don’t know what more I could have done. I maybe waited too long because those girls are specialists and over the last 100 it takes me longer to get my legs going. I’m gutted because I was so close and it was there.”Isaac Makwala, the Botswana sprinter who kept the London world championships entertained last summer with a saga around his inclusion, won gold in the 400m. Makwala was barred from competing in the 400m final in London after complaining of an illness but later claimed he had been well enough to compete. The 31-year-old crossed the line in 44.35sec open-mouthed and arms spread in a crucifix position, finishing well clear of his compatriot Baboloki Thebe, who took silver in 45.09, and Jamaica’s Javon Francis in third.He claimed the Commonwealth title made up for the disappointment of not being allowed to compete in London. “I came here ready for this and everything has been going well since the world championships,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8813d562fb0761a4cd3a8522467584fe5b7d081/466_0_3249_1949/master/3249.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=797013dc488a89a275659f39898ec14b 1240w","title":"commonwealth games england not doing so good largest team 5m","story":"Largest ever team to leave these shores is trailing Australia by a distance and the administrative backup has missed a trick tooTeam England ticked very few boxes at the Commonwealth Games on Tuesday, from the support officials who incomprehensibly botched the entry form for the cyclist Melissa Lowther to the athletes who became the latest high-profile names to fail to win medals.With 390 athletes and 198 support staff, the England party is the largest ever sent from home shores to a sporting event, comfortably eclipsing the Great Britain team which travelled to the 2016 Olympics. At a cost of £5m of taxpayers’ and national lottery money to cover a preparation camp in Brisbane, flights, kit and other expenses, it has not come cheap. As the established names, arguably those most likely to inspire the future generation, continued to fall by the wayside on Tuesday through injury or lack of performance, it became increasingly difficult to defend that sum.Tom Daley, one of a handful of household names here, announced he was withdrawing from the 10m platform inidual event because of a hip injury. By nightfall on Australia’s east coast the weather had turned grisly, thrashing rain soaking spectators at the Carrara Stadium and English athletes producing performances to match.Andrew Pozzi, a world champion with every opportunity to win, finished joint sixth in the 110m hurdles final, beating only one man. Ahead of him were Cyprus’s Milan Trajkovic, whose only senior titles are a pair of golds at the Games of the Small States of Europe, and the Australian bronze medallist Nicholas Hough, ranked 43rd in the world last year. “It doesn’t take a brain surgeon to see I should have been fighting for the medals,” Pozzi said. “I was in good enough shape to win a medal. These opportunities don’t come up often, so I have to wait another four years.”In the hammer the Olympic bronze medallist Sophie Hitchon conceded she might need to fine-tune a new technique she is experimenting with after three foul throws left her in last place. The 26-year-old had entered the contest as favourite, expected at the very least to improve on the Commonwealth bronze medal she won at Glasgow in 2014. Her capitulation encapsulated a miserable Games for England’s most well-known performers.There have been notable exceptions, particularly at the Aquatics Centre, where Ben Proud defended his 50m freestyle title, but even he was making amends for disqualification in the 50m butterfly, an event in which he was also reigning champion, earlier in the week. “When I lost the opportunity to retain my 50m fly title I really was clinging on to what I had left,” Proud said after winning in 21.35sec, half a second ahead of South Africa’s Bradley Tandy and Cameron McEvoy of Australia.Despite a slew of medals in the pool and at the gymnastics, where Nile Wilson has repeatedly performed, the gap to the home nation in the overall standings is growing. With 130 medals, including 50 golds, Australia are not going to be caught by England, who have 74, including 24 gold. “The tiny island nation of England are not doing so good,” cackled a DJ on a local radio station.The Brownlee brothers had set the tone in the triathlon on the opening morning of competition. Alistair, a double Olympic champion, trailed home in 10th while Jonny, who has claimed silver and bronze medals behind his sibling, was seventh. Both cited injury but neither seemed particularly cut by the defeat.Max Whitlock is Olympic champion on the floor but could finish only seventh, beaten by the Cypriot Marios Georgiou, a part-time dancer who goes by the name “street boy killer”. To his credit Whitlock fronted up after his defeat and said he was still getting used to a new routine but it did call into question how important the Commonwealth Games is to athletes who know there are bigger tests round the corner.The curse of the champions continued as Adam Peaty, fresh from winning the 100m breaststroke, was also defeated for the first time in four years in the 50m breaststroke at a Games which is showing little regard for bookmakers’ odds. Peaty reasoned that swimmers typically peak in the summer months, not in April when they would usually be in heavy training.The same is true in athletics but Adam Gemili, another name who withdrew with injury, said he felt the time of year is irrelevant. “We all knew it was going to be in April and had plenty of time to prepare for that,” he said. “It shouldn’t really be an excuse for anyone. It’s more just unfortunate circumstances and a bit of bad luck.”The chef de mission, Sarah Winckless, might have been tempted to implore the team’s big names to raise their game but she is occupying shaky ground when it comes to performance. The team’s leader was forced to apologise to the 21-year-old Lowther after she was unable to compete in the cycling because an official failed to tick a box on an entry form for the time trial.The extraordinary administrative error was not spotted until it was too late, despite “seven or eight” layers of checks when the mistake could have been identified. Despite the reputation of the Commonwealth Games as the “friendly games”, the organisers refused to bend the rules to allow her to race. It is understood she is devastated and her family, who were hoping to watch her on the TV from their home in Wakefield, are furious.Winckless, a world champion rower in 2005 and 2006, offered a personal apology to Lowther. “No athlete should suffer because of an administrative error by my group,” she said. “As soon as we knew of the error we did everything to rectify it and it went to the Commonwealth Games Federation re-allocation committee – unfortunately they were not minded to add her into the draw.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e84e70e20cfa198d5b02fa2348df3c456e2c71/9_78_2028_1216/master/2028.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8d9714429f0ef00ef4d6002da0e9cf34 1240w","title":"grand national aintree course heavy red marauder 2001","story":"• Bad weather leaves Aintree ‘heavy in places’, says course clerk• Only four horses finished almost unraceable National 17 years agoThe going on the Grand National course at Aintree was “heavy in places” on Tuesday evening after 8mm of rain fell at the track in 24 hours, raising the possibility the conditions on Saturday will be the most demanding since Red Marauder’s 33-1 success in 2001.“We were due a couple of millimetres on Monday night and a couple more early morning,” Andrew Tulloch, Aintree’s clerk of the course, said. “But unfortunately we got a lot more than that. Hopefully it will dry a bit before Thursday and it looks like we’ve had most of the rain.“But having said that, temperatures haven’t really got up much. It feels more like autumn than spring, it’s significantly colder than yesterday and, if it had just gone up a couple of degrees with a bit of sunshine, that would have helped. But that’s Mother Nature for you.”The ground was close to unraceable 17 years ago, when the four finishers from 40 starters included two horses that had been remounted by their jockeys, a practice now banned. The race was the second to be run on heavy ground in a four-year period, following Earth Summit’s win in 1998 when six of 37 starters completed, including one that had been remounted.Only two Grand Nationals since 2001 have been run on going any slower than good-to-soft but with some rain in the forecast for Aintree on Thursday and Friday, the ground seems likely to be soft at best. As a result, the betting could change significantly as punters latch on to runners with low weights and proven form on heavy ground.The first major gamble of the week arrived on Tuesday, as Ross O’Sullivan’s mare Baie Des Iles was backed down to a top price of 20-1 having been available at 66-1 last week. Katie Walsh, O’Sullivan’s wife, will be in the grey’s saddle as she bids to become the first female jockey to win the National, and Baie Des Iles not only has form at extreme distances and on soft ground but is also set to carry only 10st 7lb this weekend.“Baie Des Iles could end up being our worst result,” Rupert Adams, a spokesman for William Hill, said on Tuesday. “She will love the ground, is a grey and most importantly has Katie Walsh on board. It is a possible perfect storm.”Walsh is one of three female jockeys expected to line up for Saturday’s race, and Milansbar, the mount of Bryony Frost, is another soft-ground specialist that could attract support if the ground remains slow.“When he won at Warwick, Bryony had never sat on him before and she just gelled with him straight away,” Robert Bothway, Milansbar’s owner, said on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27dd3f8e30a7daa658b96d250cda81247f49d297/152_81_2371_1422/master/2371.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3c2d05bad64789f8548bce40c86806ec 1240w","title":"leicester ben youngs dodged bullet northampton comeback","story":"If the enduring image of England’s opening Six Nations victory in Italy was a quartet of Exeter players deep in celebration, oblivious to the downward spiral that was to follow, then the lingering sound was unmistakably that of Ben Youngs crying out in pain.Youngs’ tournament lasted only 10 minutes before suffering a knee injury which at the time looked likely to end his season, possibly even his chances of touring South Africa. The shriek of agony said as much and Eddie Jones knew only too well that the prognosis was not good, seconding Richard Wigglesworth within minutes of the final whistle.“I got a bit of stick for the yelp,” says Youngs. “Sometimes it is the fear of what it might be, especially when it is your knee. When something like that happens you fear the worst. But I certainly feel like I dodged a bullet. The results of the scan showed that I didn’t need an operation and that ice and corrective rehab would get me right, and I knew that I would still be able to play at the back-end of the season.”It is too simplistic to pin England’s subsequent stumbles on one single factor – the breakdown, Billy Vunipola’s absence or fatigue, for example – but of all the excuses offered up, Youngs’ injury seems as valid as any. Danny Care had nowhere near the impact he tends to when habitually replacing Youngs after an hour and Wigglesworth, truth be told, toiled on his international comeback. Leicester’s head coach, Matt O’Connor, was not exaggerating when he remarked that Youngs had been “drastically missed”.Youngs chose to keep his distance from the England squad during his lay-off, opting against fulfilling any commercial duties at Twickenham or offering any advice in the WhatsApp group, instead watching from the sofa with the knee in a brace. The road to recovery has been a smooth one – surgery was avoided – and he is ready to make his comeback against Northampton on Saturday with Leicester currently third and, as they always tend to do, timing their play-off push perfectly.“I was in a brace, sleeping in it, in it 24-7. I was on crutches, I couldn’t really do a lot so I would have been completely in the way. It was my decision to watch from home – you see a lot more on the TV. I’m not one that gets up and down and starts throwing things but I get a little bit animated. I care about that group.”If England have keenly felt Youngs’ absence, however, Leicester have not. The Tigers have won their last five in the Premiership, having ended 2017 with a run of six straight defeats. Indeed, it was not so long ago that O’Connor’s position was under threat but Youngs pinpoints the victory at Saracens in February as the seminal moment of the season. Furthermore Leicester have a habit of improving as winter turns to spring – since the Premiership adopted a four-team format for the 2005-06 season the Tigers have been ever-present. And victory over their east Midlands rival Northampton would go a long way to securing their place this season.“We just seem to start randomly at the beginning of the year, then we get our act together,” says Youngs. “I think the pride that we’ve always made the top four helps.

About £9m has been set aside by the Home Office in a push to try to clean up the dark web, a largely hidden part of the internet whose users can operate with relative anonymity.Rudd is to make the announcement on Wednesday afternoon at a conference in Manchester organised by the National Cyber Security Centre, the front window for the government surveillance agency GCHQ.In other measures, more than £5m is to be spent on establishing police units at regional and local level dedicated to help fight cyber crime. Until recently, cyber-crime has not been a priority for police forces, with most under-resourced. An excerpt from Rudd’s speech released in advance pinpoints the dark web as a target. “A dark and dangerous place where anonymity emboldens people to break the law in the most horrifying of ways. A platform of dangerous crimes and horrific abuse. A sickening shopping list of services and products are available.“So today I’m pleased to announce that we will be giving over £9m to enhance the UK’s specialist law enforcement response. They will use this money to help combat the criminals who continually exploit the anonymity of the dark web.”Earlier this year, Matthew Falder, a paedophile operating on the dark web, admitted 137 charges and was sentenced to 32 years. The Home Office funding is part of £1.9bn pledged by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in 2016 to improve the UK’s defences against cyber-attacks, including those on business and infrastructure. The £1.9bn was to cover spending through to 2021. The Home Office is to spend about £50m, including the crackdown on the dark web and cyber capability for the police at regional and local level, during 2018-2019.Rudd will say: “The world of cyber is fast developing and we need a fast-developing response to match, one that recognises that it is the responsibility of everyone in the UK to fight the evolving threat.”More police are to be trained to help them develop the skills needed to investigate cases of cyber-crime.“My own father was the victim of fraud and I know from personal experience the importance of supporting those who have been victimised through no fault of their own. And now that it’s happening online, it’s happening to even more people.”She will add: “But business owners, cyber-security experts and iniduals can do a lot to help too. Because in the same way that shops protect themselves from burglary with locks, alarms and security guards, I expect businesses to take equivalent precautions digitally.”In a separate development, Donald Toon, director for economic and cyber-crime at the National Crime Agency, one of the co-sponsors of the Manchester conference, said the UK is to secure a handful of unexplained wealth orders (UWOs) in the next few months as part of an effort to target assets they suspect are part of money-laundering or other illicit operations.Billions have poured into the UK from Russia, China and the Middle East to buy up property, companies and other investments. UWOs have only been used twice so far, both times on the same inidual. Toon said his officers were working on about 100 cases and he expected about five more UWOs to be issued in the next three months."},{"url":null,"title":"mark zuckerberg testimony live congress facebook cambridge analytica","story":"Mark Zuckerberg gives testimony to Senate committees in light of revelations that Cambridge Analytica used Facebook data to influence US votersThanks for following along with our live coverage of Zuckerberg’s trip to Congress. If today’s five hours of Zuck weren’t enough for you, tune in tomorrow morning for Round Two: The House of Representatives. In the meantime, you can read my colleague David Smith’s full report on the day here. Thune is closing things up by again bringing up concerns about conservative bias, and asks Facebook to err on the side of allowing speech.Grassley jumps in to say that he spoke with another CEO of another platform yesterday who admitted to him that he was a liberal. Grassley is kind of rambling about media bias and partisanship. It seems that Grassley is calling on Zuckerberg to reduce cynicism about government institutions in his spare time. “I hope that everyone will do whatever they can to help increase respect for government.” “I’m sorry you had to listen to me,” Grassley adds. The hearing is adjourned. Young: If we created a stronger property right that states users own their data – or a stronger opt-in rule – would you have to change Facebook fundamentally?Zuck: It depends on the details. Zuck says that Verizon or other ISPs should not be able to have knowledge of content, but Facebook and other platforms can and should.False alarm on the final questioner: We now have Senator Todd Young, who notes that there isn’t a single senator who doesn’t use Facebook to communicate with constituents.Tester: You said multiple times during this hearing that I own the data. I’m going to tell you that I think that sounds good, but in practice you’re making $40bn a year, I’m not making money on it. It feels like you own the data... Could you give me some idea on how you can honestly say it’s my data? Zuck: When I say it’s your data, what we mean is that you have control over how it’s used on Facebook. You clearly need to give Facebook a license to use it otherwise the system doesn’t work.Tester: The fact is the license is very thick, maybe intentionally so. We’re getting close to the end, with the final round of questions from Senator Jon Tester. Zuckerberg: Yes, but not that seriously. He says there was a malware attack in 2013. Garder is now asking about Facebook’s ability to track the articles people read on non-Facebook sites (such as this one!). Garder asks whether users understand what is happening, and Zuck stumbles toward saying yes, which is a tough claim to make. Zuck says the social context of having the “Like” button is a clue, but I would guess that most users don’t know exactly how Facebook uses those ubiquitous Like buttons.Here’s a ProPublica explainer of how that works. Senator Cory Gardner is now reading parts of the terms of service related to account deletion, which mentions that backup copies may persist after an account is deleted for some amount of time. Zuckerberg says he doesn’t really know how long those backup copies stick around, but seems confident that they are actually deleted. Cortez Masto is reading out various aspects of the 2011 FTC consent decree. What did you actually do in response to the decree?Cortez Masto: Had you addressed the issues then, had you done an audit, you would have known that this type of data was being shared. That’s what I’m saying it’s time for the change. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto: “Stop apologizing and let’s make the change. It’s time to really change the conduct.”Senator Shelley Moore Capito: Does Facebook get a cut of advertisers’ sales?Now Zuck is kind of explaining the ad auction, which is very confusing territory. “We get paid when the action the advertiser wants to happen happens.” Hassan: Will you commit to working with congress to develop ways to ways of protecting constituents, even if it means laws that adjust your business model?Zuck: Yes. Our position is not that regulation is wrong. Says that they just want to make sure it’s the “right” regulation. Zuck: This episode has clearly hurt us and has made it a lot harder for us to achieve our social mission. Senator Maggie Hassan: “There’s clearly tension between your bottom line and what’s good for your users.” Hassan says that she believes that Zuckerberg believes that he will never prioritize advertisers over users, but it’s a for profit company, and he has an obligation to his shareholders. Senator Ron Johnson: Do you have any idea how many users actually read the terms of service? Zuck says probably not a lot of people, but he doesn’t know. Says that everyone has the “opportunity” to read them, and that it doesn’t change the fact that they’ve consented to it. Considering that Facebook (and any other publisher) can tell how many seconds a user stays on any inidual webpage, I see no reason why Facebook couldn’t provide precise analytics of how many people have read the terms of service and how deep into the document they got.Senator Tammy Baldwin asks whether Kogan sold the Facebook data to anyone besides Cambridge Analytica?Zuckerberg: Yes, he did. Zuck mentions Eunoia as one of the companies, but says there may be others. John Kennedy: Can somebody call you up and say I want to see John Kennedy’s file?Kennedy: Not can you do it. Could you do it?Zuck: Technically someone could do that but it would be a massive breach. Senator John Kennedy: I don’t want to regulate Facebook but god help you I will... I say this gently: your user agreement sucks. You can spot me 75 IQ points. The purpose of that user agreement is to cover Facebook’s rear end, it’s not to inform your users about their rights. You know that and I know that. I’m going to suggest that you go home and rewrite it."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

My younger son hasn’t started yet he’ll go in September. The older one is in year 1. Their mum is a trainee teacher, at a different primary school in the area. I have very little idea what goes on there, though. She is too exhausted when she gets home, physically and emotionally drained, and busy preparing for the next day, to talk about it much. Ask my boy what he has done at school that day and the reply is generally, “I can’t remember” or “Nothing much”.So this will be an interesting eye-opener for me, as well as for the people taking part. Blackrod primary school, outside Bolton in north-west England, has some new pupils. “Oh my God,” say the assembled children collectively when Class 6M comes in and turns out to be some of their parents, in school uniform. They’re here to find out what it’s like to go to primary school today.The kids and their parents in Blackrod are a bit different from the ones in our neighbourhood in Brent, north-west London. The Blackrock pupils are mainly white British and have English as a first language, even if it sounds different. The curriculum is the same, however, all about the three Ts: testing, testing and testing.And 6M aren’t being let off they’ll be doing Sats at the end of the process and are straight in with a maths test – bad news for legal secretary Julia, 47, who was never much good at maths. Soon her hand is up and she’s asking: “Can I go to the toilet?” I’d give her a sticker for the “to the” instead of just asking to go toilet but it’s soon clear it’s not about going toilet she’s gone for a cry. “I feel so stupid,” she sobs.“Don’t be daft,” says Mrs Mead, the teacher assigned to 6M. “This is part of the journey for us.”Mrs Mead is lovely, warm and strong. In fact, everything about Blackrod seems nice. The head has been there for more than 30 years, but he’s open to new ideas, as well as to letting the cameras in. “If you don’t take risks with anything, men would still be in a cave,” he says. Very true, Mr Flintstone … only messing, Mr Dryburgh. And he stresses the importance of music, drama and art.The grounds look lovely, there’s a horse in the field (not many of them where we are, and if there was, nobody would know what it was) and the sun is always shining – in Greater Manchester! I’d say Blackrod was an outstanding school and Ofsted agrees. (Obviously, being a parent in 2018, I can’t just look at a school and make up my own mind I have to look at the bloody Ofsted report). Would this programme maybe have been more interesting in a more challenging environment?Even the kids at Blackrod are pleasant, or else have been well trained for media. It’s not important to fit in, says one, you can just be yourself. They look out for each other, don’t even mind having their parents around.Apart from all the testing, primary school seems nicer now than it was, certainly for Julia. Turns out maths wasn’t the only issue for her. “I was scared to go to school,” she says. “Because I knew that my whole day would be hell.” There’s some of that going on, dredging up demons from the past it’s therapy, as well as finding out what her daughter Asha gets up to during the day.For Mark, 53, an engineer, the demons are PE demons. He didn’t like it then he doesn’t like it now. Nor does his son, Robert. Impending sports day is giving them the cold sweats, but they’re going to give it a go, for the team. Blackrod seems to me to be about right on competition as well – it doesn’t deny it, encourages it even, but winning isn’t everything there are points for taking part as well.Mark is good at maths he gets into the spirit of the place by helping Julia out. Rubbish at running, maybe, but he’s caring, patient and protective. Certainly protective of his two sons, both of whom are autistic.There’s always one to spoil everything – or to make it, from a television point of view. We have had the good news, the journeys, the tears. But every school drama – every school documentary, even – needs a bad boy, too.Stand up Jonny. A 36-year-old decorator, Jonny is soon sneaking off for a crafty cigarette, swearing, and he’s not happy about all the rules and regulations. “There’s less rules in prison,” he moans, and he may well know. Send him to Mr Dryburgh. Also required: a little extra English."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb9508ac2b33c0651303a3491a1c2e7cc9d0d2d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=448defb9a1cf031fe89f2ca885e3b402 1240w","title":"saturday night live how the show has been exported around the world","story":"The long-running comedy series will receive a regionally specific version in Italy and it joins a long line of international takes on the classic formatHow do you say “more cowbell” in Italian? Last week, NBCUniversal signed a transatlantic deal with European media titan Sky to produce a regionally specific version of Saturday Night Live in Italy, expanding an already global network of sister shows. Though the past few years have seen the stateside SNL steep itself in the particulars of national politics more aggressively than ever before, the show’s format has proven malleable and lucrative in lands abroad.From Asia to Africa and beyond, the appeal of short-form scenes featuring celebrities and musical guests has struck a universal chord with viewers. This new Italian spinoff won’t even be the first to grace the country’s airwaves – an earlier effort titled Saturday Night Live From Milan ran for four seasons to roundly positive notices.In anticipation of the upcoming Sabato Notte Vivo (or whatever they end up deciding to call it), take a tour around the world with SNL’s international nephews and nieces, from Spain’s short-lived non-starter to the surreal celebrity cameos of Korea.Germany may not be known for its zany sense of humor, but during the better part of the 90s, RTL Samstag Nacht brought a dose of levity to the national television climate. However, the jokes were often dry to grim: the show’s breakout character was Karl Ranseier, an unlucky fellow whose increasingly improbable death scenarios would often be announced via a faux news report as an end-of-show gag. The Ranseier joke grew into a phenomenon all of its own, the German response to the proliferation of “that’s what she said” from the American remake of The Office.You can’t spell “Español” without SNL, and yet this explicit remake failed to gain a foothold in its market. That the show only lasted through a brief 12-episode run in 2009 could be attributed to several factors, most glaring among them the show’s title of Saturday Night Live, despite running during primetime on Thursdays. Moreover, audiences bristled at the lazy recycling of well-known sketches and dearth of original, culturally customized material. (The Spanish-language rework of the beloved Behind the Music bit does not pack the original’s comedic wallop.)South Korea has forged one of the strongest successes, a popular direct adaptation of the American program complete with Weekend Update and Digital Short segments. The similarities have their limits, however, and what lies beyond is can be wondrous and bizarre. Never is the difference in styles and tastes between the US and Korea more pronounced than when a Hollywood star with overseas appeal stops by. Model Miranda Kerr, MMA fighter Bob Sapp, part-time Asgardian trickster Tom Hiddleston, and most memorably, Korean favorite Chloe Grace Moretz have all made appearances to try their hand at phonetic pronunciation. One sketch, in which Moretz plays a young woman whose understanding of Korea is based entirely on soap operas, plays like a fever dream of unlikely cultural interchange.Saturday Night Live bil Arabi is recorded in Egypt – true to form, each program’s cold open concludes with an actor breaking the fourth wall to shout “From Cairo, it’s Saturday Night Live in Arabic!” – but caters to a massive area. Due to the erse array of cultures within its reach, this ranks as perhaps the most anodyne iteration of the program, keeping the humor steeped in the silly and safe from taboos. Nevertheless, the censors of Egypt’s media board suspended the program in February of this year due to accusations of “sexual implications” in the writing. A rich, detailed history of Japanese comedy made the nation a natural home for another SNL in 2011, drawing on the traditional konto style of slapstick rather than high-concept character-driven sketches. While the theme sequence uses identical music and the usual oh-I-didn’t-see-you-there cast introductions from the US version (along with the usual guest hostmusical break format, including the Weekend Update segment), the content itself would be somewhat unfamiliar to the western humor palate. Konto works in shorter bursts, and bears a strong resemblance to standup as opposed to sketch comedy.In France, the Big Mac is le Big Mac, and Saturday Night Live is Le Saturday Night Live. This spinoff has only been on the air for a little over a year, but has already made itself known to American audiences. Crossover comedian Gad Elmaleh hosted the series’ pilot episode and recently stopped by Conan O’Brien’s show to dish about his experiences, which included yet another parody of the “more cowbell!” sketch. Truly, nothing bridges the cultural gap quite like a paunchy man pelvic thrusting while banging on a cowbell at an ear-splitting volume. (Also in French: SNL Québec, a spinoff for Lorne Michaels’ compatriots.)Nothing like a little laughter to warm up the forbidding cold of Scandinavia, and in 2016, this program tried to bring some heat to the Finnish comedy world. With an odd lineup of stars to host – A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master director Renny Harlin graced the show in 2016, this time in front of the camera — and a reliance on bits purloined wholesale from the American original, it lasted all of one season. (Brazil produced another one-season wonder back in 2012, similarly failing to gain a foothold due to an inability to develop its own identity.)SNL Polska has been going strong since late 2017, bringing the energy of Warsaw – the New York City of Poland! – to a close adaptation of the original. Check the boxes: Weekend Update (complete with Drunk Uncle), political satire goofing on the prime minister, even the pop-culture parodies that mostly serve as an occasion for the cast to go around the horn with recognizable impressions. They even did the Star Wars Auditions sketch!

A monument in Belgrade to the first person in space did not last much longer, being swiftly dismantled after causing online hilarity owing to its curiously small head. On Sunday, a number of Serbian websites noticed that a monument to the cosmonaut had appeared on a street in the Serbian capital that beared his name. The large plinth and the small bust of Gagarin’s head prompted the website Noizz to quip: “The only way you can see it clearly is to launch yourself into the sky.”The monument’s unfortunate proportions prompted a barrage of online sarcasm and inspired an array of parodies, including the following tweet.The official unveiling was to take place on Thursday, Serbian media reported, but on Tuesday the monument was dismantled. A video published online showed a man climbing up a ladder and unceremoniously wrenching the undersized head from its plinth. Goran Vesic, a city official, said a new monument would be commissioned and would be vetted by all relevant institutions before installation. “Gagarin will have a memorial in Belgrade worthy of the contribution that he has made to humanity,” he said in a statement reported by the wesbite B92.net.There are dozens of monuments to Gagarin across the former Soviet Union. A town in western Russia close to his birthplace was renamed Gagarin in 1968 after the cosmonaut’s death in a plane crash.

And this goes on today. We need to do better.”The church needed to “love people as God made them”, he said. “That will have implications for our policies and stances as churches. If we are to do better, we need to change.”There had been “other times in the history of communities of faith when people have found it difficult to accept change, and sometimes difficult to see God’s hand in it”, Bayes said.“A classic example is the struggle for the abolition of slavery, and the ceaseless advocacy that was needed on the part of Christians to persuade their friends that God’s love for all human beings had social consequences which demanded justice.”The Ozanne Foundation, which Bayes is chairing, would advocate courteously but “consistently and without apology” for change in C of E policy and culture, he said. “It’s work which demands patience, but which also calls for a holy impatience … While we are talking, people are suffering.”Bayes is the most senior member of the C of E hierarchy to press publicly for far-reaching change in the church’s attitudes to LGBT people and a meaningful welcome to Christians in same-sex relationships.As a senior bishop associated with the church’s evangelical wing, he has previously acknowledged that he has been “profoundly changed” by encounters with lesbian and gay Christians, including within his own family.The C of E is moving “glacially slowly” on changing its attitudes, he said.The church has been wrestling with attitudes to gay clergy and congregants in same-sex relationships for at least two decades, but campaigners for LGBT equality believe the current of opinion is in their favour.Although the church still formally adheres to traditional biblical teaching that marriage can only be a union between a man and a woman, in practice many churches offer informal blessings to gay couples who have gone through civil wedding ceremonies.The Ozanne Foundation is named after Jayne Ozanne, a prominent campaigner for equality within the church. Its three-pronged strategy is to “encounter, educate and empower”, and it will work with organisations around the world to advocate for equality and ersity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f881d3c8ee5b507c5ac56e3da1a1f366c351e922/0_33_750_450/master/750.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8c3b03d181fe238134cbf9483931a75f 1240w","title":"europes longest heated cycle path to connect dutch cities","story":"1.7km Wageningen to Arnhem link set to be kept snow-free by energy from local paper plantThe longest heated cycle path in western Europe, and possibly the world, is set to be built in a Dutch beauty spot to cut the commuting time between two of the country’s cities all year round.The new 1.7km “cycle highway”, which forms part of the route linking Wageningen and Arnhem in the east of the Netherlands, will be kept warm by residual heat from a local paper plant.Concerns have been raised that frogs might find the warm path a little too comfortable, putting them and cyclists in danger. But Gelderland council has promised to monitor the impact on the local wildlife, which includes many water birds and beavers.Towns across the Netherlands have been investing in heating stretches of cycle paths, but nothing on the scale proposed in Gelderland has been constructed.Cutting through the Jufferswaard, a nature reserve near the Nederrijn in Renkum, the two-way cycle path is also likely to be one of the most idyllic, and is due to be completed in time for the winter of 2019. De Jufferswaard, a nature area of 31 hectares (77 acres), is located in the floodplain along the Nederrijn river, between the factory site of the paper mill Parenco, one of the area’s biggest employers, and the Rhine bridge at Heteren village, 7.5 miles (12km) south-west of Arnhem.Petra Borsboom, a spokeswoman for Gelderland council, said they believed the path would be the longest of its type in western Europe. “We don’t want to make the claim that it is the longest in the world because there might be one in China we don’t know about,” she said.The cycle route will shorten the riding distance between Wageningen and Arnhem by 600 metres. The biggest gain of the route would be “time, safety and experience”, the council said.She added: “This path is mainly for commuters. It is a beautiful protected area and that is the reason we wanted to do this.

My mother sat down with me and proclaimed that it was the most important decision that would bring about peace for my generation and that for once we would all be equal. I remember watching both our local and the national TV coverage as I was so engrossed in the story of people putting aside differences and working towards peace. The peace process is a shining example of the good that politics and democracy can bring. It makes me proud to say that I’m from Northern Ireland due to its legacy and how that can inspire other nations also experiencing internal conflicts.Brexit poses a grave risk to the positives of the Good Friday agreement. Although I grew up in a RepublicanNationalist household I would have self-identified as a Unionist, as I felt Northern Ireland was better off as part of the UK and the EU. After the EU referendum results, my ideological views completely shifted and I wanted a united Ireland instead. I travel on the Enterprise train from Belfast to Dublin. Will a hard border force us to stop for a customs search? My boyfriend lives in Dublin and the thought that there will be added unnecessary delays when we come to be together feels so foreign and illogical to comprehend. To disregard the Good Friday agreement and its importance is to disregard the unique and special relationship Northern Ireland has with the Republic of Ireland. In doing so, Brexit risks not only the agreement but also the very nature of the United Kingdom.I grew up in suburban Dublin and my parents were from border areas (one north, one south). We visited my grandparents north of the border on a regular basis and spent a lot of time with my cousins, aunts and uncles there. It didn’t matter to me that helicopters flew overhead every day or that there were armed soldiers patrolling the streets of the quiet countryside town.  In 1992 I turned seven. My sister and I were staying with our grandparents for a few days and I was let out on my bike as long as I didn’t cross any roads. Around one corner there was a soldier holding a rifle. I was probably only a few metres past him when a huge bang went off. I was terrified and raced down the road and hit straight into my grandparents’ door. I found out later that the soldier was shot by a sniper.  Six years later and with the Good Friday agreement the lookout towers started to be dismantled and there were barely any street patrols. People were happier and free to come and go as they pleased, play sports, walk the hills and enjoy the magnificent countryside. Life was better. It got rid of the bad from both sides and I want neither to return, nor do I want anybody to relive what I’ve experienced - but I want them to remember.On the day of the agreement I remember my parents watching in the afternoon on the small TV in the living room and telling me to watch it as it was history in the making. I wasn’t really that interested though. It was lovely and sunny and the first day of the Easter holidays so I took my younger sister up to a building site to explore instead! In the run up to the election however I was engrossed. I asked my father why all these yes and no signs were up everywhere and he explained the terms of the agreement. I read the booklet and remember saying quite clearly that I would vote yes.I’m very disappointed in the current state of affairs in Northern Ireland. The political parties seem more concerned about getting one over each other rather than focusing on changing issues that affect us all, such as the economy. I really hope Brexit has as little effect as possible as a hard border would be a nightmare situation. If the UK economy slows as a result Northern Ireland will be hit the worst.My employers in Dublin gave me the day off to travel north to vote. I cried for most of the journey as I remembered the last time we dared to hope. I had grudgingly accepted failure and chaos, not due to the people of the island of Ireland - whether they were green or orange, but the history of Britain’s politics in Ireland did not stand up well to scrutiny. After the results were announced I still expected to be disappointed it took me years to fully accept it could work. But no matter what we think of modern day politicians they stood tall. Some thought it a victory whereas I thought it was a wasted life and 30 years. We had just been permitted to compete but had yet to start running. I had fully accepted that I wouldn’t live to reap the true rewards nor perhaps would my 10-year-old son. It will be a long slow road but at least there is a road. However Brexit will be nothing but negative for all concerned.I am embarrassed to say that I voted against the Good Friday agreement. At the time, I felt that the prisoner release scheme was a step too far and that it was difficult for people to forgive the violence and death that was part of the Troubles for so many years. I was 18 and I had always lived in Belfast and I think I found it difficult to see the broader picture. Within a very short time I was able to see the value of it ending violence and enabling politicians to engage with each other across the sectarian ide. I feel that all the politicians involved worked hard to secure the agreement and, despite some terrible atrocities in the weeks and months after, it has been successful in ending violence. I am happy that my children can now enjoy their lives without the knowledge or the threat of paramilitary violence. There continues to be ision and political uncertainty in Northern Ireland and the peace process is still very much a ‘process’, however the achievements of the Good Friday agreement mean that, eventually, we will have a stable and more progressive country. I was nearly 12, and remember the vote no graffiti going up in various places along the way from Belfast to Armagh. I was quite apathetic to the whole thing. Thankfully the Good Friday agreement seemed to have a pretty decent impact, especially after the Omagh bombing. Industry in Northern Ireland is now on the wane, and the political vacuum that exists now is really worrying. It’s really sad that the schools and residential areas are still segregated and I genuinely believe that no real difference can be made unless children realise from the earliest possible age that their neighbours from a different religion are just as benign and boring as they are. It looks as if Brexit will be wholly negative and that is because the political powers have been largely irresponsible to date. The role of Northern Ireland has straddled the odd position of being completely ignored by one side (UK) and being used as a pawn to benefit a party and leader’s status in another jurisdiction (RoI and EU negotiations). I wouldn’t be very optimistic if the changes heralded by Brexit are as drastic as some Tories and others are pushing for. Some names have been changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00f5d36a74019233cd187fd754b53e68b23ae1f/0_173_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=eb4c276496ef6e8aa1fefebd7eb172d4 1240w","title":"mexico to include former cowboy el bronco on presidential ballot","story":"In a midnight ruling on Monday, the tribunal found in favour of Jaime Rodríguez, a cowboy turned state governor better known as “El Bronco”, allowing him to become the fifth candidate in the election. Analysts said that his inclusion in the race, potentially pulls votes from the current frontrunner, Andrés Manuel López Obrador – a leftwing populist who courts the same anti-system voters as Rodríguez.This year’s election will be the first in which independent candidates are allowed to run for the presidency, but the process has already caused yet more disenchantment with Mexico’s young democracy.The contrast between Rodríguez and Patricio’s attempts to get on the ballot “is one of the clearest expressions of the inequality that exists in our country in access to the law: high requirements for all, but only the weakest are obliged to comply with it”, tweeted Andrés Lajous, an academic.The ruling caused disquiet in Mexico, where the incumbent Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) trails by double digits – but could benefit from Rodríguez’s inclusion in the race as PRI voters are considered the least likely to opt for an independent candidate.Mexico’s electoral tribunal acts as a final arbiter for election matters but is widely perceived as having ruled in the PRI’s favour in a series of controversial cases.“It’s an ace up the PRI’s sleeve,” said Federico Estévez, political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.Rodríguez, from the northern state of Nuevo Leon, made history in 2015 as the first candidate without a political party to win a gubernatorial contest.Since then, his political star has dimmed and has drawn scorn for controversial comments such as saying two earthquakes which rocked Mexico last year were the result of a population being “too liberal in the topic of faith”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish-news","story":"GPs likely to resist plan to make State-funded medication available without prescriptionCouple from US fatally injured when thrown 15ft into ravine from pony and trapUK Brexit secretary David Davis claims Government\u0026rsquos stance influenced by Sinn F\u0026eacutein\u0026lsquoThe parties basically don\u0026rsquot like each other, and they\u0026rsquore putting that above us as people\u0026rsquoAndanappa Yalagi happy for pro-choice campaigners to use daughter\u0026rsquos imageFionola Bruton says adoption is a \u0026lsquochild-centred\u0026rsquo solution to unwanted pregnancyProtection of sports grounds \u0026lsquocritical for future of community\u0026rsquo, says chairmanEfrem Gidey wins senior schools title just months after arriving in Ireland from Calais\u0026lsquoDo not give up the freedom\u0026rsquo Belfast Agreement has brought, former US president saysLongford meeting told it is a myth that homelessness is confined to citiesMinister Joe McHugh announces funding for summer colleges and island communitiesMan has claimed he was physically and sexually abused while in foster careRedevelopment of site will include cafe and jetty but will not retain swimming facilityEvent commemorating deal hears repeated calls for North\u0026rsquos leaders to re-establish executiveAccused using his hearing difficulties to \u0026lsquoavoid dealing with sentencing\u0026rsquo, says judgeEuropean Council president given honorary life membership of UCD Law SocietyPathologists unable to determine cause of death of Patrick Dennison, inquest hearsComplainant tells Central Criminal Court man was \u0026lsquofather figure\u0026rsquoThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3456739.1523351964!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gardiner-apologises-for-remarks-on-belfast-agreement-1.3456740","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner described the agreement as a shibboleth. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty ImagesUK Labour politician Barry Gardiner has insisted he “absolutely” does not believe the Good Friday Agreement is outdated and said he was “deeply sorry” that remarks he made about the deal had led to a “misunderstanding”.Gardiner, Britain’s shadow international trade secretary, told a conference in Brussels last month that the Irish Government was playing up the issue of the Border in Brexit negotiations for economic reasons and described the Good Friday Agreement as a “shibboleth”.In a recording of his remarks, which The Irish Times has heard, he said:“I think we must also recognise that there are real economic reasons why people have played up the issue of the Irish border and the need to have the shibboleth of the Good Friday agreement. And that is because it is hugely in the Republic of Ireland’s economic interest to make sure that there is no tariff and no external border there”.In a statement released on Tuesday, Mr Gardiner apologised for the remarks, saying: “The Good Friday Agreement is a vital and essential part of the relationship between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and has been central to the two decades of peace it has brought about.“Labour is completely committed to the agreement and opposed to any return of a hard border between North and South.“We are committed to negotiating a new customs union between the UK and Ireland as part of a final Brexit settlement, which would play a key role in ensuring there is no hard border.“I am deeply sorry that my informal remarks in a meeting last month have led to misunderstanding on that point — in particular, that my use of the word ‘shibboleth’ in its sense of ‘pass word’ or ‘test of membership’ gave the impression that I thought the Good Friday Agreement was in any way outdated or unimportant.

But the proposals in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, go much further, and call for a complete ban.“More and more primary school teachers are reporting than girls as young as seven are coming to class with headscarves,” Serap Güler, integration minister in the regional government said. “Putting a headscarf on a child is perverse. It’s sexualising the child.”Ms Güler, who is of Turkish heritage, said her own mother wears a headscarf. “But she made that choice as an adult woman.”Angela Merkel’s government weighed in on the debate on Tuesday as Annette Widmann-Mauz, the national integration minister, warned a ban could be counter-productive. I completely understand where this is coming from,” Ms Widmann-Mauz said.“But a ban does not solve the underlying problem behind it. We have to reach out to parents and make sure girls are empowered to make their own choices. At the same time, women who voluntarily choose to wear a headscarf should not be disadvantaged.”Julia Klöckner, one of Mrs Merkel’s key allies, gave qualified support to the proposal this week, saying: “Children need a safe space free from crude gender images, and that space should be school”.“From a religious Islamic perspective, there is no reason to wear a headscarf before reaching sexual maturity,” Haci Halil Uslucan of the German Advisory Council on Integration and Migration said.But Burhan Kesici of the Islamic Council of Germany spoke out against the proposals, saying: “Forcing people to wear headscarves and banning headscarves are two sides of the same coin. They are both hurtful to Muslims.” The dispute comes as the government of Austria announced it will introduce a ban on headscarves at primary schools and kindergartens this summer.“We want all girls in Austria to have the same opportunities,” Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor said, adding that he wanted to avoid the development of “parallel societies”.The ban is backed by Mr Kurz’s coalition partners in the far-Right Freedom Party (FPÖ). “Girls under the age of ten must be protected and enabled to integrate and develop freely,” Heinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party leader and vice-chancellor said.Please review our commenting policyRobbers pick fight with wheelchair-bound man who turned out to be a 6ft 7in tall Afghanistan veteranNHS returns to china cups and saucers in war on disposable cupsTheresa May among world\u0026#39s most admired women for first time... but she is still below Taylor Swift and the Queen Protests banned outside abortion clinic in landmark vote by London council Concussion in 20s could increase the risk of dementia by 60 per cent, Lancet study finds  Macron warned \u0026#39France beheads its king\u0026#39 in new Hollande bookTen-day hospital stay is enough to make pensioners age 10 years, new NHS medical chief warns Car thieves target middle-class areas, data reveals, as police warn drivers to invest in a steering wheel lockComment: An 80 year-old trapped in hospital loses body mass equivalent to 10 years of ageing.

However, it turned out to be a determined seal, which swam 50 miles through Britain’s river network from the North Sea in pursuit of fish.The long-distance swimmer had most likely become lost and disorientated after chasing a salmon or sea trout upstream, according to experts.The seal is thought to have swum through York on its way to the Dales, in pursuit of fresh Spring salmon.Seals are mammals which usually prefer a salt water marine environment, as this is where most of the fish they can eat are found, but can also swim in fresh water, and do this when they chase their food sources up rivers.Anthony Hurd, the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust’s Living Seas Centre Manager in Flamborough, said it is not rare for seals to travel upstream in search of food, but that it is “surprising” the animal was spotted so far inland. It is thought by the Trust that the animal became lost while on its journey to catch fish.Bex Lynam, The Trust’s North Sea Marine Advocacy Officer, told The Telegraph: “Seals are known to use a number of the UK’s rivers and on occasions will swim upriver for quite some distance. “It’s thought that they are simply following their food source which would include salmon or sea trout making their way up the river at particular times of the year. “They may then become disorientated, especially younger seals, which is why they have been reported found in fields and similar unusual locations, having hauled themselves out of the river and on to dry land.”Seals are mammals which usually prefer a salt water marine environment, as this is where most of the fish they can eat are found, but can also swim in fresh water, and do this when they chase their food sources up rivers.Walkers were stunned to see the large grey male seal near Thirsk, at a spot near Topcliffe Weir.He was pictured by amateur photographer Karen Hargreave, from the area, who said she had never seen anything like it before.She said: \u0026quotSome friends of ours went for a walk, and saw something large in the river. \u0026quotOn closer inspection they realised it was a seal and as I am interested in wildlife they messaged me. \u0026quotApparently the seal had turned up last Thursday morning. Locals from the mill spoke to various experts, some I think may have visited the site, and confirmed it was a large healthy male. \u0026quotHe had probably swum up from the Humber estuary following salmon. \u0026quotWhen I saw the message, I rang my friend as I couldn\u0027t quite believe it. She confirmed the sighting .but also said that it had since disappeared. \u0026quotMy husband and I decided to try our luck on Friday morning, and sure enough he was still there,  out on the bank. He was an amazing sight.\u0026quotThe seal was seen swimming in a wierHe was also spotted by walker Tony Wilson, 48, who thought the animal was a sheep.Mr Wilson said: \u0026quotIt looked so bizarre. At first I thought it was a sheep but as I got closer I saw he was a great big grey seal. I couldn\u0027t figure out how he\u0027d arrived there but speaking to people in the village later it seems he\u0027d swam all the way from the sea up the river.\u0026quotSea life experts were impressed by the \u0026quotincredible\u0026quot journey the seal made. Head Curator at Sea Life Manchester, Alan Kwan told The Telegraph: \u0026quotIt\u0027s true what they say, there\u0027s no such thing as a free dinner, even in the animal world!
