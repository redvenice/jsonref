He was last spotted exercising at the Meadows Rehab Centre in Wickenburg, Arizona, last yearBut the real drama lies elsewhere. For despite being one of Hollywood’s most recognisable stars, Spacey has apparently disappeared off-screen as well as on it.Nothing has been seen or heard of the double Oscar-winning actor since the first allegations emerged over a year ago in October 2017.On both sides of the Atlantic, where Spacey owns multi-million-pound homes, the question is being asked with growing urgency: where is Kevin Spacey? ‘He’s become a total recluse,’ one friend told The Mail on Sunday.‘No one has heard from him. He’s vanished. It’s almost unbelievable that someone of his stature can pull it off in a world where everyone has a cell phone.’One producer described Spacey as having ‘one of the most recognisable faces on the planet’ and added: ‘I was with him when he walked into a restaurant in Beverly Hills and the whole place applauded.’It may be a long time before he garners applause again.His downfall began on October 29, 2017, when Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of sexually assaulting him in the star’s New York apartment in 1986 when Rapp was just 14, triggering a string of similar complaints.          As the new series of the US political drama House Of Cards was screened earlier this month there was a gaping hole. President Frank Underwood, portrayed  by actor Kevin Spacey was killed off by uneasy producers and script writers following sexual assault and harassment allegations made against the actor  last yearTo date, 30 men have made public allegations about the actor. While no formal charges have been filed, police in LA and London are investigating allegations of sexual assault, including rape. In the UK, there are six active investigations. The Old Vic theatre in London, where Spacey was artistic director for 11 years until 2015, said it had received 20 complaints of inappropriate behaviour during his tenure.Spacey issued a swift and contrite apology, ended years of rumours about his sexuality by ‘coming out’ as gay and checked into sex rehab clinic The Meadows in Arizona alongside disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.But unlike Weinstein – who has been photographed going about his daily business, visiting his lawyers’ offices and picking his children up from school – there has been no sign of Spacey anywhere.The Mail on Sunday has spoken to – or attempted to speak to – dozens of Spacey’s friends, colleagues and acquaintances in the UK and the US in an attempt to piece together his movements.Final season of House of Cards gets middling reviews as...\u0027It brought the #MeToo movement very close to home\u0027: Tom...Share this articleBut it is clear that Spacey’s vanishing act may be his best coup de théâtre so far.The last known pictures of the actor are fuzzy paparazzi shots taken at the £25,000-a-month rehab facility in November last year.There, Spacey was supposed to undergo a 45-day sex addiction ‘detox’ but, we can reveal, checked out after only 21 days.‘He left early,’ said one friend, on condition of anonymity. ‘He only stuck it out for three weeks.’Where he went after that remains unclear – although there are plenty of associates who claim to know where he is.One well-connected British socialite who knew Spacey during his Old Vic days insists that he is living in seclusion in the Cook Islands, a string of 15 tiny islands in the middle of the South Pacific.‘He’s living as a hermit in the Cook Islands,’ she said authoritatively. ‘He’s keeping his head down until this blows over.     One well-connected British socialite who knew Spacey during his Old Vic days said he is living in seclusion in the Cook IslandsHe still has a lot of rich friends from his Old Vic days. He has enough money to stay hidden.’But a source who worked on House Of Cards insists that the actor, whose real name is Kevin Spacey Fowler, is in hiding in France.‘He’s been in the South of France living on a big estate,’ the man said. ‘He’s been working out like crazy, doing massive oil paintings and keeping a low profile.’It may well be, sources say, that he has put his formidable acting prowess to good use in order to avoid detection.One source said: ‘Kevin is travelling under his real name of Kevin Fowler.’ Intriguingly, the source added: ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s not been seen because he is going out in public wearing a disguise. He’s spent his life transforming himself into other characters – why not now?’Certainly, the star has not been seen at any of the homes in his international property portfolio.Spacey is said to have visited New York since the scandal broke but stayed with a ‘wealthy friend’ connected with the theatre world.A doorman at Spacey’s former Manhattan home – now sold – said: ‘We’ve not seen him here for a long time, well before the scandal.’Another former associate suggested he is ‘hiding in plain sight’ in a rented ranch in Thousand Oaks, a suburb of Los Angeles which recently suffered a double tragedy of a mass shooting and a wildfire.‘Kevin’s been staying at a friend’s place in Thousand Oaks,’ the associate said. ‘He’s become a hermit and never goes out.’The actor has also not been seen at his £2.3 million London flat.With the exception of Spacey’s estranged brother Randy, not one person was prepared to go on the record to discuss the star.One person who worked closely with Spacey claims to have received a call from the actor in which he was ‘genuinely baffled that everyone has turned their backs on him’.‘He doesn’t understand why no one has stuck up for him,’ the colleague said. ‘He sounded quite indignant.’But no one else, it seems, is surprised. ‘It’s typical Hollywood, no one will say a word about him because he’s just too toxic,’ his elder brother Randy, 62, said yesterday. ‘My brother was always an arrogant p**** and now karma has come round to bite him in the butt.‘He was the goose who kept laying the golden eggs, so people protected him. Of course people close to him knew about his extra-curricular activities, but while he was making money they turned a blind eye.’Randy has had no contact with his famous sibling for 15 years after giving an interview about their childhood which he says sent his ‘control freak’ brother ‘ballistic’. But he says he believes that Spacey is ‘lying low’ in the belief the ‘water will cool’.

No one at the General Medical Council, the watchdog responsible for vetting the background of medics, checked whether her documentation was genuineIt meant that for more than two decades from 1995, Alemi was free to treat thousands of mental health patients in the NHS, apparently prescribing medicine, making assessments and even sectioning some of the most vulnerable in society.The deception by Alemi, thought to be of Iranian extraction, was only discovered after she was convicted of trying to fake the will of an elderly woman to steal her £1.3 million fortune. A judge described her as \u0027despicable\u0027 and jailed her for five years last month.The Daily Mail learned about the GMC\u0027s review after being alerted by an investigation into Alemi\u0027s background by Carlisle\u0027s News and Star newspaper.Children as young as TEN are having hip and knee...NHS \u0027let down\u0027 aristocrat Lady Beth Douglas, 18, who died of...Share this articleThe fraudster, who could have earned up to £100,000 a year working as an NHS psychiatrist, enjoyed the trappings of wealth – buying bottles of expensive champagne as investments and driving a red Lotus Elise sports car.It is understood that when she came here, Alemi showed officials a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery certificate.In reality, her only qualification was a degree in human biology.Last night patients\u0027 groups called for a public inquiry as police confirmed their investigation into Alemi was ongoing. John Woodcock, independent MP for Barrow and Furness, in the Lake District, where Alemi was most recently working, said the case was \u0027hugely alarming\u0027.           Alemi, who could have earned up to £100,000 a year working as an NHS psychiatrist, had also been investigated in 2012 after failing to disclose a conviction for careless driving\u0027If this had been one inidual that had slipped through the net it would have been concerning, but the idea that it could be a systemic loophole that has been exploited is hugely alarming,\u0027 he said. \u0027It is understandable that patients are calling for an inquiry – this is of sufficient magnitude that that may well be necessary.\u0027The GMC admitted its checks had been inadequate and confirmed an \u0027urgent investigation\u0027 was looking into the backgrounds of 3,000 doctors who came to work from Commonwealth countries, before 2003, in the same way.Incredibly, Alemi had been investigated and given an official warning by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in 2012 after failing to disclose a conviction for careless driving.She also sectioned psychiatric patients for treatment without the authority to do so, and was banned from working for 12 months as a consequence. Despite this, no one thought to examine her background or the reliability of her qualifications.One woman, who claimed one of her relatives had been poorly treated by the fake psychiatrist, wrote on Facebook: \u0027The way she (Alemi) treated my relative was appalling and now that I find she was not a qualified psychiatrist, and was allowed to treat patients for 22 years, I am beyond livid.\u0027Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said it seemed \u0027incredible\u0027 that someone could slip through the net in such a fashion. She added: \u0027There definitely needs to be a public inquiry – how many patients will she have come into contact with? Patients will be horrified that the proper checks weren\u0027t in place.\u0027GMC chief executive Charlie Massey said the doctors being checked represented just 1 per cent of the 300,000 medics on the register and that vetting was much more rigorous today than it was in the 1990s.But he admitted: \u0027It is extremely concerning that a person used a fraudulent qualification to join the register.\u0027 Last night, the GMC could not say exactly where Alemi had worked during her career, although she is understood to have had links to West Yorkshire, Lancashire and Scotland.She was working as a locum old-age psychiatrist at Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust in 2016 when she met 84-year-old Gillian Belham.Alemi befriended Mrs Belham, but when she was accused of stealing watches from the pensioner, police discovered she had been working to take control of her finances – even deceiving some of her friends into being signatories on a new will. The Cumbria trust said it had launched a review.The Department of Health said: \u0027We expect the GMC to investigate how this criminal was able to register as a doctor and put measures in place to make sure it can\u0027t happen again.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"The law change make marriages legal says polyamorous woman","story":"    Mary Crumpton is polyamorous - meaning she believes in having more than one partner. Mary  made a lifetime commitment to John Hulls (left) earlier this year despite being married to Tim Crumpton (right) People who are polyamorous consent to their partner\u0027s being in a relationship with somebody else.Naturally Mary\u0027s husband Tim Crumpton gave her his blessing to be married and even walked Mary down the aisle of the special blessing ceremony. Mary lives with Tim and John under the same roof in Chorlton, Manchester and is in equally committed and loving relationships with both of them.What\u0027s more Mary also has two boyfriends who live nearby and if any of her partners wanted to start seeing another woman at the same time, she\u0027d be happy for them.Although Mary is married to both Tim and John, it\u0027s only her commitment to Tim which is legally recognised. Mary\u0027s situation has spurred her to try and change the law and she it now is getting ready to lobby for new marriage rules. \u0027John was already living with me and Tim before John and I had our ceremony,\u0027 explains Mary, 45.\u0027He moved in with us in 2015 so we\u0027d already got into a stable and happy domestic situation, so it\u0027s not changed anything practically, but it has changed things emotionally for me.\u0027It\u0027s lovely to be able to feel that I\u0027ve made that commitment to John, so that he\u0027s not \u0027in second place\u0027 any more.\u0027We got to the point where John and I both felt that we wanted to make that lifetime commitment, but obviously in this country you can\u0027t marry more than one person.\u0027Tim was fully supportive of mine and John\u0027s commitment to one another.\u0027 Mary and John\u0027s ceremony took place at Chorlton Unitarian Church. They made vows to each other, and Tim and John made extra vows, promising to honour and respect Mary\u0027s commitment to the other man.\u0027The church is very forward thinking, they were the first to do homosexual marriages and civil partnerships so they are very inclusive and respectful of ersity,\u0027 says Mary.\u0027I went to the church and said that I\u0027d like to have a wedding with John. I told them I knew it wouldn\u0027t be a legal wedding, but I wanted it to be a wedding in every other respect.\u0027They ran it by the committee and everyone was fully supportive.\u0027That\u0027s quite an amazing thing because as far as I know, it\u0027s the first polyamorous wedding ceremony that\u0027s happened in a church in the UK.\u0027People have had handfastings in fields, but an actual church saying yes we will do this for the first time, we\u0027ve made history and I\u0027m proud of that.I hope that other churches will follow on.\u0027The way we did it, with the help of a minister, Laura Dobson, we structured a service, with a walk down the aisle, the white dress.\u0027There wasn\u0027t a dry eye in the house! Everyone was really moved by the whole thing.\u0027We kept a lot of the things that are in a normal service, we kept all those normal wordings in - we promised lifetime commitment. Clearly we weren\u0027t going to say excluding others because I\u0027m married to Tim as well!\u0027It was lovely, having all the family there and everybody being so supportive. There were lots of people who\u0027d never seen anything like this before and got used to it through seeing it happen, coming up afterwards saying: \u0027Mary that was amazing, I didn\u0027t get it before but I can see that it\u0027s really working for you\u0027 so that was lovely.\u0027Since then everything has been great. Tim and John get on great, they\u0027ll go off on bicycle rides together - they joke that I\u0027m a bit of a wild one and it takes two of them to keep me in line!\u0027          Mary at her wedding to second husband John earlier this year          Mary\u0027s two wedding rings. Mary is lobbying for a law change that allows people to be married to more than one personMary is keen to push for change to marriage laws so John has the same legal rights as Tim, who she married in 2013.\u0027In our hearts, he is my second husband, I have two husbands, but clearly legally, Tim\u0027s the only one,\u0027 says Mary.\u0027There are plenty of people in my situation who have more than one partner they would like to commit to for life, be it same sex or different sex, and we\u0027ve got a lot of Muslims in our country now and I don\u0027t quite know how it works if they bring their wives here, maybe they have to pick one to be their legal wife, and I don\u0027t think that\u0027s fair.\u0027I think that I want to have a country where we respect people\u0027s choices, in terms of their relationships and if that means that a Muslim man wants to marry three women and have those women respected in law as his wives, he should be able to do so.\u0027And if I want to have two husbands, then I\u0027d like that to be respected in law as well, and I don\u0027t see any reason why it shouldn\u0027t be.\u0027At the moment, because I\u0027m not legally married to John as well as to Tim, if I was knocked down by a bus tomorrow and was in hospital, Tim would be my next of kin and gets to make all the decisions and John would not be recognised.\u0027Clearly Tim and John are close and therefore of course Tim would consult John, but if they disagreed about a decision, what would happen then?Google executive leaves the company with no severance after...Me, my husband and my boyfriend: Woman, 34, shares her bed...Share this articleJohn\u0027s rights are not respected. \u0027Other things like, if I die and I haven\u0027t made a will, everything would go to Tim and John would get nothing. I have to make a will to make sure everything gets split between them.\u0027But if I\u0027d been able to legally marry John as well as Tim, then I wouldn\u0027t have to go that extra mile, it would just be automatic.\u0027There\u0027s things like that, where John has no legal rights because I can\u0027t marry him legally and that upsets me, and there are a lot of people in the country that this affects, who are in a similar situation, who are having to do work-arounds to make sure that any partner they are not married to get fully respected.\u0027I would really like to see a change in the law. We\u0027ve done marriage for people in homosexual relationships, this is the next thing that needs to happen.\u0027I think there needs to be a big campaign, people need to write to their          Mary and Timothy Crumpton who walked her down the aisle at her second marriageMPs, get the issue raised in parliament and go from there really.\u0027That\u0027s my target for next year, do some research and get as many people on board as possible to make it happen.\u0027There\u0027s lots of people who aren\u0027t polyamorous but know people who are, and I\u0027ve said this to them and they say absolutely, quite right, you should have your other relationship respected and legalised, that\u0027s perfectly reasonable.\u0027I think there\u0027s lots of people from the Muslim community who would be in favour as well. I think the next thing is put together a team of people and try to take the campaign forward.\u0027The first thing was lets talk about it, lets get other people talking about it and get it more accepted and less judged, and go from there. So watch this space.\u0027Mary says there are more people living in polyamorous relationships in the UK than people might realise.\u0027There are lots of people living like this, there\u0027s a UK poly group, there\u0027s a Manchester poly meet-up group, people get together. They have confidentiality rules because a lot of people haven\u0027t told their families or workplaces.\u0027When I first started looking into it I thought there wouldn\u0027t be anybody, but there\u0027s loads of people.\u0027The Manchester polyamorous community is quite big, they have meet ups a couple of times a month, there\u0027s a lot more people living this way than you would imagine.\u0027You could have a married couple next door, and you think they are going out with a friend but actually it\u0027s their partner, because they are discreet about it.\u0027Since Mary last spoke out about polyamory, Tim has started seeing someone, but far from being jealous, Mary says she is pleased that her husband is happy, and would give her blessing to any of her partners if they wanted to pursue relationships with more women.\u0027They are very welcome to (have other relationships). My husband Tim has recently started seeing a new lady, and that\u0027s going really well,\u0027 says Mary.\u0027They\u0027ve all been on dates occasionally but not really developed any relationships particularly.\u0027This is the first time Tim has formed a bond with someone, so hopefully this one will pan out. I\u0027m very, very pleased for him. It\u0027s very exciting.\u0027I think jealousy arises because of fear of losing somebody.\u0027My relationship with Tim is so good, and I know that we love each other so much that I don\u0027t feel in the slightest bit threatened by him falling in love with someone else.\u0027I know it\u0027s not going to affect him and me at all. Knowing that, I can just sit back and be really pleased for him that he has some extra happiness in his life.\u0027It\u0027s no different to if he\u0027d joined a darts team and was suddenly going out every week to play darts, I\u0027d be pleased he had a new interest.\u0027I see him having a new partner as the same thing, I\u0027m pleased he\u0027s got something new in his life, bringing him some joy.\u0027I know the person and she\u0027s lovely so I could not be happier, I\u0027m really happy to finally see him having that as well.\u0027I\u0027ve had the joy of being in love with more than one person and he\u0027d been open to it but it hadn\u0027t really happened, so to see him exploring that is just great.\u0027People are used to the idea of you having a second child, if you have a second child it doesn\u0027t mean you love the first one any less so people understand that love is not a limited resource.\u0027I just say, romantic love works the same way as that kind of love, I can love more than one person at the same time, actually, a lot of people can.          Mary lives with Tim and John under the same roof in Chorlton, Manchester and is in equally committed and loving relationships with both of them\u0027A lot of people have been in that situation of being in a relationship with one partner and loving someone else, and they either pretend that they haven\u0027t got those feelings, or they have an affair, neither of which are great outcomes.\u0027A lot of people do understand is that it is possible to love more than one person, the only difference is people in my situation talk about it and find a way to make it work.\u0027As for whether or not she\u0027d consider another relationship herself in future, Mary is thinking practically.\u0027Even though I say love is not a limited resource, time is. There are only seven days in a week, to try to have more partners than that would be a challenge,\u0027 she says.\u0027I suppose if you had a partner who was long distance, who you only saw once a month then maybe.\u0027I always say never say never. If Prince Charming walks in tomorrow and I fall in love with him I\u0027ll just have to find a way round that.\u0027I do know people who are in polyamorous relationships who have six or seven partners, but that\u0027s generally partners who are not all living together, because time is an issue.\u0027For me it\u0027s really important that I am giving quality time to everybody I\u0027m involved with.\u0027If you have too many partners, to my mind, for me, I would find it difficult to do justice to the relationships so it\u0027s about having that balance of allowing love to blossom and flourish where you find it, but equally being sensible about how much time you have got, how much you can commit to.\u0027Mary wants to carry on being open about polyamory, as she feels many people still don\u0027t really understand what it\u0027s all about.\u0027I\u0027ve been called a slag. People would find out and say: \u0027Oh, you\u0027ve got two men, that\u0027s disgusting and perverted\u0027 so I can understand why people feel they have to hide it,\u0027 says Mary.\u0027I thought someone needs to stand up and say \u0027this is how some of us live, and it\u0027s okay\u0027.\u0027I knew there would be some backlash, it has in some ways been a challenging thing to do but I felt someone had to do it.\u0027A lot of people have the wrong idea about it, they think it\u0027s all leaping into bed with people, sleeping around.\u0027There are some people who do that, there\u0027s a whole community of swingers, and that\u0027s what some people do and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that. That\u0027s fine, it\u0027s just not me.\u0027It\u0027s about love. Although I have more than one partner, I am quite old fashioned, I don\u0027t just go straight in with people, I have to know that I am in love with someone before I am fully intimate.\u0027That\u0027s something people didn\u0027t understand, they thought: \u0027Oh you just want to s**g around\u0027. There\u0027s nothing wrong with that, it\u0027s just not me.\u0027I want genuine love and relationships with more than one person at a time.\u0027          After she first spoke to the M.E.N about her lifestyle, Mary was overwhelmed by messages from people from the UK and beyond, after the story was picked up by the international media.Most of them thanked her for speaking out, as it enabled them to tell their families and friends that they are also polyamorous.But it did not come without its downsides, with Mary even receiving death threats from people who did not agree with her lifestyle.\u0027It was a bit mad, I got so many messages, literally hundreds of private messages on Facebook from people tracking me down,\u0027 says Mary.\u0027It was overwhelmingly positive, but there were some negative. I had death threats: \u0027What you are doing is immoral and against God\u0027s law, I\u0027m going to come to your house and kill you.\u0027\u0027One guy even found out where I live, took a photo of my front door and sent it to me with a message saying: \u0027I wasn\u0027t joking, I\u0027m going to kill you tonight.\u0027\u0027Before I had a chance to do anything about it, he deleted the account so it was untraceable. So yeah I put the chain on that night!\u0027That\u0027s one of the reasons I chose to speak out about it, because we live in a world where if someone is doing something a bit different, people are very judgemental.\u0027But people used to be very judgemental about being homosexual, but now it\u0027s so much accepted - people know that people fancy people of the same sex- and I think that\u0027s where we need to get to with different relationship styles.\u0027We need to get to a point where people just say: \u0027Okay, you happen to be polyamorous, you\u0027re monogamous, we\u0027re all just living our lives and if people understand how it works, that\u0027s the first step.\u0027I got people from all over the world messaging saying thank you for speaking out, saying: \u0027I showed this article to my dad then told him I was the same way.\u0027\u0027I think I managed to explain it quite well so people could see it\u0027s not some weird, perverted cult. It just so happens that I love more than one person, and that\u0027s okay.\u0027]  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/16/4DE1F7CB00000578-0-image-a-149_1530633320806.jpg","title":"Lingerie tycoon Tory peer spoken just THREE TIMES three years House Lords","story":"    June 17: At a yacht race with boyfriend Doug Barrowman, in white T-shirt, three days before missing a vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill          January 10: With fighter Conor McGregor while the Lords debated the Data Protection Bill and domestic abuse legislation          Wimbledon: July 15 -  Enjoying the tennis in a month when she did not attend the Lords once out of 15 days when the chamber was sittingOut of a total of 457 sitting days in the House of Lords since she entered the House, she has attended just 89 – less than two every ten working days.From June to December last year, she attended five days out of a possible 74, and has only ever spoken in the Lords three times, including her maiden speech.But she regularly travels the world to make paid speeches at business summits, occasionally using a backdrop featuring her title, Baroness Mone of Mayfair OBE.Her title has also appeared on literature for a venture capital firm she set up with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.Last week, she jetted off to the Males and promoted a luxury villa to her Twitter and Instagram followers, missing key debates on Monday and Wednesday on counter terrorism and border security.After being contacted by the Daily Mail, on Saturday she posted pictures from her ‘long-deserved romantic’ Males break, but said she would be in the Lords today.Police say woman, 82, found dead in her flat may have fled...Mother who was told by her doctor she would miscarry says a...Bomb scare at Houston airport after Boy Scout, 17, packs...Share this article    November 16: Topping up her tan just days after missing Lords debates on counter terrorism and border securityBaroness Mone, who lives with billionaire businessman Doug Barrowman on the Isle of Man, is also under fire for claiming the maximum £300-a-day Lords attendance allowance.

He took the pragmatic path of becoming an envoy for the Gadigal of Sydney to the invaders.He was a husband and a father, a man who clung to his culture despite the ravages of colonialism and a diplomat of sorts who, with another Indigenous man, became the first of this continent’s Aboriginal people to travel to England. He developed friendships – out of necessity, certainly, but they apparently came to be infused by genuine warmth – with Europeans on his country, not least the first governor, Arthur Phillip, and the former soldier, convict and brewer James Squire. He was complex, articulate and politically savvy.Yet for more than two centuries the grave he shares with his second wife, Booring, and probably another man, Nanbaree, had lain unmarked, largely forgotten, at Putney in Sydney’s north-west, on land once the orchard of his friend, the equally enigmatic Squire. Indeed, for almost a century until 2011, its precise location had eluded Australia – not unlike the true legacy of Bennelong, who has, in death, been straightjacketed as the subject of a black-white colonial morality tale: the Indigenous man straddling two worlds, inevitably toppling into the ide, dying as an obstreperous drunk having surrendered cultural agency.The truth, thanks to some contemporary historians and others affording long-overdue dimension to Bennelong’s life, is much more complex and nuanced.And so, while the commonwealth gears up to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the arrival in Botany Bay of James Cook’s HM Bark Endeavour, it transpires that the New South Wales government is also focusing on Bennelong, revealing on Sunday that it has spent almost $3m in a semi-secret off-market deal to buy the suburban house in whose front yard (or close to it) he and the others are buried. A project committee comprising state, federal and local MPs of varying political persuasion and, critically, Indigenous elders, wants to transform the home into a memorial to celebrate Bennelong for all his remarkable complexity, and a museumeducation centre to commemorate the impact of European invasion and frontier war on Sydney’s Indigenes. There is even a plan to regrow part of Squire’s orchard in the backyard. While the government has paid for the actual property, a community group comprising Aboriginal and non-Indigenous members has now set about raising $1.2m to transform it. It’s an ambitious project that aligns with a new momentum to re-examine elements of early invasion-frontier experience free from the colonial and racial binaries that have distracted generations of Australian historians, including the most eminent.The name Bennelong – like that of his first wife, Barangaroo – is familiar throughout Australia, especially in Sydney. It has been bestowed upon the finger of harbour on which the Sydney Opera House stands and where Bennelong once lived a federal electorate a small crustacean and a suburban park close to where the man is buried. For a while it was adopted by a now-defunct, ultra-conservative thinktank dedicated to Indigenous policy – a nod, perhaps, to the purported allegorical prescience Bennelong’s supposed tragedy might have augured for the later Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to which the group prescribed its often reactionary, top-down criticisms and remedies. Yes, Bennelong’s name is well known. But his “story”, as the hack workers of history – journalists – insist on calling a life’s experience, is little understood.Several times in the past year, I’ve caught the RiverCat ferry from my place up towards Parramatta and alighted at Kissing Point, searching for some sense of the place where Bennelong lived the last decade and more of his life. Kissing Point – so named, supposedly, because it’s where in the river at low tide the keels of the early, heavily laden boats would first kiss the bottom, or where the second colonial governor of NSW, John Hunter, might have kissed his wife – rises from a long gradual rock ledge upon which the snapper fed and where the Wallumedegal harvested them. It climbs into what was once fertile land, home to Indigenous flora and fauna for millennia before being tamed and carved into settlers’ farmlets and orchards. From the ferry pontoon it’s a short stroll to Watson Street, Putney – an early agricultural part of the Sydney settlement whose kerbs are today punctuated with leisure boats, its daytime symphony one of power saws and nail guns singing in a suburb transitioning to newer money, and castles of glass and steel.Watson Street ends in a cul-de-sac – Cleves Park – that is lush with lawn, under canopies of mature eucalypts. At its foot is a small concrete memorial dedicated to Bennelong, erected by the Bicentennial Authority in 1988. It’s a throwback to that isive Australian moment when Indigenous people protested in their thousands against the ostentatious 200th birthday celebration of British invasion and colonisation. The grave is actually about 100 metres west of the monument, near the intersection of Watson Street and Horden Avenue. It is partially on the corner of the front yard of 25 Mitchell Street, a private house passed in at auction some months ago, and the unpaved verge under the canopy of some gnarly mature conifers. While the residents of Putney – and many previous owners of the house – have known the grave’s whereabouts, Bennelong’s burial spot has (at least partially) served as a thoroughfare for most of the past century. I’ve unwittingly walked over it several times.The metaphoric resonance of this seems irresistible, not least in light of the plaque on the memorial at the end of Watson Street. It reads:Bennelong was an Aborigine who befriended the first colonists, lived for a while as Governor Phillip’s guest and visited England where he became the toast of society. Following his death, he was buried hereabouts beside his wife and Nanbaree another Aborigine.It defines Woollarawarre Bennelong (whose first name has its genesis in “wallumai”, the snapper fish of the Wallumedegal, on whose land he is buried – even though his own people, the Wangal, lived on the other, southern side of today’s Parramatta River) according to his relationship with the British empire. It also makes an assertion, pregnant with falsehood (though doubtless intentional and difficult to dismiss as being merely of its epoch given the Aboriginal land rights movement in the 1980s) about just who was host to whom.Anyway, this was the trope still assigned to Bennelong in 1988. It has evolved little in public consciousness since then. And to determine how we got here, it is helpful to start at the end of the life of Bennelong, who lived from about 1764 to 3 January 1813.A Sydney Gazette obituary for Bennelong, soon after his death, reads:Bennelong died on Sunday morning last at Kissing Point. Of this veteran champion of the native tribe little favourable can be said. His voyage to and benevolent treatment in Great Britain produced no change whatever in his manners and inclinations, which were naturally barbarous and ferocious. The principal officers of government had for many years endeavoured, by the kindest of usage, to wean him from his original habits and draw him into a relish for civilised life but every effort was in vain exerted and for the last few years he has been but little noticed. His propensity for drunkenness was inordinate and when in that state he was insolent, menacing and overbearing. In fact, he was a thorough savage, not to be warped from the form and character that nature gave him by all the efforts that mankind could use. In 2009 the Aboriginal heritage historian Emma Dortins, one of the contemporary historians at the vanguard of reassessing Bennelong’s experience, wrote of how the fabric of “Bennelong’s tragedy is a closely woven web of veracities historical, allegorical, literary and moral”: The threads are not easy to disentangle, but in the light of a body of evidence for the varied fortunes and strong relationships of Bennelong’s last 18 years, it is clear that we must reflect further on his story and on its uses. Tragedy is not life, or history, but a dramatic or literary genre with its own logic and genealogy. If Bennelong’s life is ‘tragic’, then it is storytellers who have made it so.Indeed, tragedy is not life – just as life equates to far more than story.But, for more than two centuries, Bennelong’s life has in history and literature, journalism, in stage and screen drama, and even dance, been captive to a trope that pretty much fits the paradigm of the Sydney Gazette’s obituary, unflattering and defined by tragedy. The novelist Eleanor Dark’s 1966 entry on Bennelong in the Australian Dictionary of Biography (he was a principal character in her  1941 novel, The Timeless Land) gives him short shrift, from his capture by Phillip’s soldiers in November 1789, his development of a taste for liquor, going with Phillip to England in 1792 “where he was presented to King George III”, to returning to Sydney in 1795. There is no evidence that the royal court received Bennelong. The ADB says Bennelong “could no longer find contentment or full acceptance either among his countrymen or the white men”.Two years later he had become ‘so fond of drinking that he lost no opportunity of being intoxicated, and in that state was so savage and violent as to be capable of any mischief’. In 1798 he was twice dangerously wounded in tribal battles. A censorious paragraph in the Sydney Gazette records his death at Kissing Point on 3 January 1813.The ADB is in the process of compiling a new volume of Indigenous biography that will do Bennelong greater justice.Dark certainly headed the Australian vanguard of her epoch when it came to shedding light on the colonial shadows. Her novel was remarkable in its literary elegance and for its groundbreaking historical research that promoted understanding of European invasion and the complex interracial relations that followed, among both regular readers and eminent historians including Manning Clark. It was most enlightened for its day. But ultimately it did Bennelong no great service. Clark’s own writings about Bennelong, informed in part by Dark, were no more progressive, at least in the context of what is now known about the Wangal man.Bennelong lived for 18 years after returning from England, most of them as the head of what was known as the Kissing Point tribe on Squire’s land at Putney. But those almost two decades have mostly been omitted from so many historical and dramatic versions of his life.Bennelong did not fade into obscurity in the second part of his life after his return from England in 1795. He resumed a traditional Aboriginal lifestyle, regained authority as a leader, remarried and had a son. He died at the age of 50 as a respected elder mourned by his people. The writing of Vincent Smith, together with that of the historians Dortins and Kate Fullager, has brought to Australian historiography a much fuller version of the life of Bennelong which will – now that the memorialmuseum at Watson St, Putney, is definitely proceeding – be shared with a broader Australian audience, black and non-Indigenous.Jody Orcher, a Barkindji woman, member of the project committee and cultural heritage expert, says: “We as Australians need to recognise our frontier Aboriginal warriors and heroes as of national significance. Bennelong was the first Aboriginal diplomat to work with British government providing cultural knowledge of country, culture and lifestyle. Governor Phillip did acknowledge the cultural practices demonstrated from Bennelong and the Cadigal traditional owners.”She says the foods identified by Bennelong for the Europeans ensured their survival in the earliest years of the colony.“What I see though, as an Aboriginal person, is no visual commemoration of any of our Aboriginal frontier warriors or heroes ... throughout Sydney. The Bennelong Putney Project is the journey towards a recognition of the truth of respecting Australian Aboriginal history and sovereignty, right here in Sydney acknowledging two histories as one story for Australia.” In the process of building the memorialmuseum, she says, Bennelong’s grave should neither be disturbed nor identified, to avoid vandalism.It is envisaged that items from public institutions and private collections throughout Australia would be loaned to the Bennelong facility. They would include one thing in the possession of the Sydney’s Waterhouse racing dynasty: a small metallic item that encapsulates so much of the critical early history involving Bennelong and Phillip.In December 1789 Phillip, under orders from the crown to “open dialogue with the natives”, sent his redcoats to capture some Aboriginal men. A previous captive, Arabanoo, had died in the smallpox epidemic that swept through the fledgling colony earlier that year. Phillip’s men took by force Bennelong and Colebee at Kai’ymay – today’s Manly Cove – chained them and transferred them back to the Sydney settlement. Colebee escaped but Bennelong stayed for several months, during which he and the governor became acquainted. They shared language and began to understand elements of their respective cultures. Bennelong rejoined his people (his abduction had separated him from his wife, Barangaroo) after a few months.While in Phillip’s company Bennelong had also befriended the first fleet officer Henry Waterhouse. Waterhouse gave Bennelong a small metal penknife, which he took back to his people. It was among the first metal objects the Cadigal around Manly owned. They turned it into a spearhead. In 1790 Phillip and a group of his men went to Manly Cove, perhaps at the behest of Bennelong. Members of various Eora tribes were feasting on a beached whale. According to Indigenous oral accounts and European histories, Bennelong had sent the governor a piece of whale meat with an invitation for him to come to Kai’ymay. Another man, Willemering, speared Phillip through the shoulder, perhaps so he could atone for the kidnapping of Bennelong and Colebee.This encounter is freighted with immense significance for early blackwhite relations. It implies Bennelong’s complicity in the trap (if that’s what it was) for Phillip – but also his understanding that the spearing would not be fatal. Conversely there are ongoing suggestions that Phillip and his men had secreted arms and were ready to shoot when the governor was struck. Regardless, the Kai’ymay mob allowed Phillip and his men to escape – had they wanted to kill them all, they could have easily done so.The spear that struck Phillip might well have been made with the blade from the knife Waterhouse had given Bennelong months before. Waterhouse broke the shaft of the spear so Phillip could escape by boat back to the penal settlement. He recovered. Waterhouse kept the broken spear.Phillip, realising the nature of the retributive justice that had beset him, did not retaliate against his spearing at Manly. Instead he built Bennelong a hut on the point where Sydney Opera House now stands, where Bennelong lived periodically, learnt English and adopted some European habits and customs, all the while trying to enhance European understanding of – and relations with – his people in the name of preservation.In 1792 Bennelong and another Aboriginal man, Yemmerrawanne, travelled to England with the ailing Phillip. Contextualised against the times of dispossession, disease and growing violence against the Eora, theirs was a remarkable investment of faith that Phillip would, actually, ensure they returned to country from England. They were time travellers between the world’s oldest civilisation and industrial modernity, as pioneering as the first astronauts.In London they stayed for a time with Henry Waterhouse’s father, William, who paid for their tailored clothes, introduced them to society and facilitated their sightseeing.In her 2009 essay, Bennelong in Britain, Kate Fullager writes:Bennelong lived at a number of addresses, toured key sites like St Paul’s Cathedral and the Tower of London, visited museums, attended theatre performances, enjoyed urban spas, and even took in a session of the trial of Warren Hastings at the Houses of Parliament. About one year into his residence, Bennelong’s fellow Aboriginal travelling companion, the teenaged Yemmerawanne, died from a chest infection. Bennelong shouldered the supervision, and grief, of Yemmerawanne’s burial, after which he evidently felt it was time to go home. He finally managed to secure a berth back in February 1795, docking at Port Jackson in September – nearly three years after leaving his homeland. Historians have long assumed, writes Fullager, that the exotic Bennelong and Yemmerrawanne made a significant impact on England. But, she writes:Relative to Indigenous travellers from other parts of the New World who had arrived in earlier decades, Bennelong stirred next to no interest from British authorities, dignitaries, or ordinary folk.After his return to Australia, Bennelong maintained sporadic contact with the colonial government, dining with its officials and drinking their grog. Many of the earliest records suggest he had a drinking problem. It is telling, however, that his drinking was not viewed as problematic when he was imbibing with English aristocrats or at the governor’s table (several early governors were, by today’s standards, alcoholics). Indeed, in a colony occupied by white drunkards whose economy had as one of its chief currencies rum, Bennelong’s penchant for strong drink was hardly exceptional or the only potentially damaging custom that became transcultural. Yet it is the drinking that has been such a seminal and disproportionate part of the Bennelong narrative for so many who have written about him.Bennelong went to Kissing Point, where the orchardist and brewer Squire welcomed him. Squire had been a foundation member of what became the United States Army, having elected to serve in the military upon transportation from England to America in 1774. He initially served in the Maryland colonial militia, defending the North American colony against the French and the Native American tribes. He learned significantly from his contact with the North American Indigenes. This served him well for his later transportation to NSW in 1787 for stealing 10 roosters and hens.After completing his sentence in NSW, Squire was granted 33 acres where Putney stands today. He rapidly expanded his holding, establishing orchards and his brewery that serviced travellers taking the river to the secondary settlement of Parramatta. He befriended the locals, including Bennelong, who, by late in the century, headed the area’s tribe.In 2011 the environmental scientist Peter Mitchell located Bennelong’s grave on behalf of Ryde council by cross-referencing historical texts, photographs, maps, independent surveying and ground-penetrating radar work. Mitchell is now on the Bennelong Putney Project committee – along with the elders Des, Allen and Charles Chika Madden and Ray Davidson, the former federal Liberal MP Peter King, the Ryde mayor, Jerome Laxale, and the local NSW lower house parliamentarian, Anthony Roberts. “His legacy has never been adequately appreciated because of the appalling job history did on him,” Mitchell says of Bennelong. “Towards the end of his life, Bennelong was fond of alcohol and some famous authors of history overemphasised that to the point where an image of a drunken Aboriginal man coloured all aspects of his life until recently.“In recent years, enormous efforts have been made to correct that history. Buying the property where he is buried and turning it into a museum about him and the Indigenous people of the region will further help to rectify that wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d78295c69f05c39a600649b12717b03f4e3e33f7/18_132_3434_2060/master/3434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20980f88f352fdc975e053140401173b","title":"black friday 2018 best uk deals offers guide","story":"Preparation is key to getting the best Black Friday deals, so try this handy guide to what’s on offer in the UKThe countdown is on to Britain’s biggest shopping event – Black Friday – and with many high street retailers struggling, shoppers can expect to bag some good bargains.This year Black Friday falls on 23 November and will be followed three days later by Cyber Monday, probably the busiest day of the year for online shopping.Black Friday originated in the US, where stores mark the start of the festive shopping season after the Thanksgiving public holiday with big price cuts and promotions.Some UK retailers have jumped the gun and released their deals early, including Amazon, which is billing this year’s wave of promotions as its “biggest-ever Black Friday sale”.

When I bang on about toxicity or gaslighting, I notice in myself a tendency towards a tone of wounded officiousness, which may be justified or not, but either way has a sort of strangulating effect, even as it expands the range of what I might adequately describe.And this is the complaint about these sorts of terms, of course. The Oxford Dictionaries might just have easily gone for “rape culture”, or “trigger warning”, or “microaggression” in its shortlist, descriptors that act on some with the force of a hostile ideology and are considered less facilitators of subtle political or personal states and more gateways to lazy forms of reasoning that undermine critical engagement.So it is with modish political terms until they are worn down to a state of normalisation, so that for once, it seems to me, the word of the year has real purchase. As a 15-year-old, I recall reading Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique and flipping out as she described her frustration, in the 1950s, at not being able to name the specific cause of the drudgery and awfulness of her life, finally hitting on a radical new term: “sexism”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73256c9ff8a62b8978c4ce8e3aa5ba6234430d09/0_125_3420_2051/master/3420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af753718362fc99b48d1220a4fd49623","title":"the guardian view on brexit delusions the eu27 have a say too","story":"Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union is often compared to a orce: it is painful, expensive and involves breaking up a relationship built without expectation of separation. If one party is determined to do it, the other must go along with it, albeit reluctantly. Even in a unilateral decision there are two sides.Yet the European response to UK choices has been consistently neglected in Westminster. The Conservative party argued about Britain’s future relationship with the EU as if it could be settled within the cabinet. Labour has acted as if the problem with Brexit is the fact of it being implemented by Tories. The past week has dashed any hope that the motives of EU leaders might be considered more salient once a deal was struck. Faced with Theresa May’s draft withdrawal agreement, some Tory MPs have demanded that she return to Brussels and come back with a different one. Others say she must stand down so someone else can do the job. Labour’s solution is a general election, resulting in Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister and conjuring up a Brexit that does everything the one now on offer fails to achieve. Continental leaders say Mrs May’s deal is what a negotiated Brexit looks like, given where she started. There are 27 other heads of government involved and not all of them are entirely happy with what was agreed. If a UK prime minister tries to unpick the deal, other nations might want a second bite. The idea that Mrs May lacked the will to get more concessions, asserted by Dominic Raab, former Brexit secretary, is infantile and irresponsible. The deal’s flaws express the impossibility of retaining the privileges of European integration from behind red lines that necessarily sever the UK from the continent.Mr Raab is positioning himself as a replacement for the prime minister. So is his predecessor, David Davis. It is hard to think of less suitable candidates, although that is a competitive field in the Conservative party. Two men who ran the Brexit department cannot credibly argue that the deal’s shortcomings can be fixed by yet more application of their supposed negotiating prowess. The leavers who have chosen to stay in government, unofficially led by Michael Gove, are no better. They want exemption from collective cabinet responsibility, to half-support Mrs May while undermining her with demands for an upgrade to the deal they nominally agreed to endorse last week.The prime minister has at least understood that a squandering of time and goodwill have limited the UK’s options. She says there are three: her deal, no deal, or no Brexit. Some MPs who voted remain envisage a fourth: parking Britain in an outer tier of existing European architecture for non-EU members, namely the European Economic Area and the European Free Trade Association. A deal along those lines might well win a majority in the Commons, although keeping free movement of labour as a condition of single market membership would be politically problematic for all. Would it fly in Brussels? It is hard to know when no one is making the request explicit.Mrs May’s stated trio of outcomes result from one set of political and parliamentary paths. If MPs want to take a different road then they need to spell their ideas out, with parliament allowed to reassert control over the process and render alternatives plausible. Since before the referendum was even held, there has been far too much reliance on dream scenarios and not enough setting out of options based on realistic appraisal of the situation on both sides of the Channel. Pedlars of delusional fantasy took Britain into this dangerous mess. Their voices can be discounted when evaluating routes to safety."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f5d5fd2ed0df9f7d67bb771859bc986db5433c3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=906eb43196e43bd42cbb91b0875a574f","title":"brexit class labour conservative leave peoples vote","story":"The Tory leave elite is dragging the country towards a disaster that the opposition could still avert by calling for a people’s voteOver the past two and a half years, while the most vocal leave and remain campaigners have endlessly yelled at each other, Brexit has often presented itself as a case study in contradiction and complexity. Certainly, whenever I have spent time in leave-voting areas, I have always felt deeply ambivalent: sick and tired of the delusions that sit at Brexit’s heart, but also keenly aware that in some of the most neglected parts of England and Wales, a huge chunk of the people who voted for it did so because they had not been listened to for decades. As the whole saga groaned on, if I had a position, it was that Brexit probably had to happen – but that in its inevitably awful consequences might lie some eventual realignment of our politics, and the final death of an exceptionalist English fantasy with no place in the 21st century.Now, as much as similar thoughts still arrive on a daily basis, I wonder. Most of the Conservative politicians who championed leaving the EU and were then given the job of carrying it out have deserted their posts. The story of how key leave campaigners cheated their way to success may only just have started to unfold. And every month brings stories, too often overlooked, of how Brexit will blight the places that supported it: this week it was news about a doomed ball-bearing factory in Plymouth, in business for 50 years and now owned by the German company Schaeffler, but set to close with the loss of more than 350 jobs – partly, says the company, because of the “uncertainties surrounding Brexit”.This much we know: whatever the stories of the millions of people who ended up backing it, Brexit originated in the failure of successive Conservative leaders to adequately deal with a tribe of uncontrollable Tory ideologues, and in the ingrained tendency of post-Thatcher Conservatives to play fast and loose with the livelihoods and security of the rest of us. In an awful instance of irony, the misery and resentment sown by the deindustralisation the Tories accelerated in the 1980s and the austerity they pushed on the country 30 years later were big reasons why so many people decided to vote leave. What also helped was a surreal campaign of lies and disinformation, both during and after the referendum campaign, waged by entitled people with their eyes only on the main chance.These things are part of a vast charge sheet not only against the modern Conservative party, but an alliance of old and new money that has set the basic terms of British politics for the past 40 years. Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson were educated at the same exclusive school as the prime minister whose idiotic decision to hold a referendum gave them their opportunity. Nigel Farage and Arron Banks are archetypal examples of the kind of spivs who were given licence to do as they pleased in the 80s. For all their absurd bleating about “elites”, we all know what these people represent: the two faces of the modern English ruling class, who have long combined to be nothing but trouble.Which brings us to the question that, for all my lingering ambivalence, I cannot shake off: if the Labour party leadership is so radical, and allied with the best leftwing traditions, where is its anger about what these people have done?While some of us have been spitting feathers about the deceptions perpetrated by rightwing leavers, Jeremy Corbyn has seemed barely interested. Is there some kind of awful equivalence between the rightwing Brexiteers, who see national crisis as the ideal seedbed for a free-market utopia, and leftwingers who think socialism is similarly best assisted by disaster? Whatever the explanation, and whatever the levels of support for leave among Labour voters, a supposed party of opposition – and a leftwing one at that – accepting a project birthed and then sustained in the worst kind of rightwing political circles is a very odd spectacle indeed. This, surely, will also be the verdict of history.As things stand, Labour’s position is apparently built on two fairly incredible beliefs: that it could somehow negotiate a much better Brexit, and that it wants a general election, which parliament is very unlikely to grant. Even if a contest did happen, unless the Tories were mad enough to plunge us into the chaos of no-deal, what exactly would it be about? With Brexit both falling apart and defining the entirety of day-to-day politics, Labour’s crafty fudging of the issue in 2017 would be impossible. Would its central offer be the difference between the current plan, to stay in a customs union for an unspecified period, or Labour’s guarantee to do so permanently? Might voters basically be asked to choose between the negotiating nous of Tories and the supposedly superior talents of Corbyn, Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry? Contrary to Labour’s hype, there is no chance of any deal delivering “the exact same benefits” as the status quo, nor of the party’s fabled “jobs-first” Brexit: with his usual bloodless candour, Donald Tusk this weekreminded us that our passage out of the EU is “a lose-lose situation and that our negotiations are only about damage control”. As if anyone needed reminding, this would apply to a Labour government as well.The country currently has three options, and parliament seems unlikely to be able to sensibly choose between them: the current withdrawal deal or something very like it, the unimaginable chaos of no-deal, or no Brexit. Self-evidently, leaving the EU without an agreement would be by far the most nightmarish, which is one of the reasons why Labour’s determination to vote down May’s deal is not without hazards. But in the midst of such imperfect options, and with heavy reservations, I think I know what we need to avoid national disaster: a Labour party ready to move beyond Corbyn’s hollow claim on Sunday that another referendum is merely “an option for the future”, and embrace what is now known as a people’s vote, with a recommendation that Britain should stay in the EU.Given that the Labour leadership has seemingly dug in, the only hope of any such move lies with MPs, and pressure that could be exerted by the party’s vast membership. Clearly, after two wasted years, even beginning to embed the idea of questioning and then abandoning Brexit in places where a majority voted for it would be an onerous task. Doing so would require enough working-class voices – where, for example, have the big unions been? – to convincingly speak to people and places that voted to leave the EU but have the most to lose from its consequences.Labour would have to find a courage that it has so far failed to discover, and sideline the anti-EU mindset of its own leader. Vocal remainers both inside and outside the party would need to realise that any move in this direction would have to be part of a policy offer that even the boldness of, say, John McDonnell has so far only skirted. All told, it would involve something to which even these supposed radicals are averse: risk.But what is the alternative: to carry on swallowing not just the endless deceptions of the leave elite but the also the disastrous effects their awful arrogance will have on people and places across the country?British Conservatism is in decay and disarray to mark its gravest postwar crisis by accepting its most heinous project would be a strange thing to do, and an evasion of our politics’ central fact: that Brexit is a class issue, and all else follows from that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26e97a99c2d561384a45246c6e0a0df38af1017b/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7da5a523b28873453735b190ab229ff5","title":"poverty exists denial un report austerity","story":"When the then UN special rapporteur on violence against women, Rashida Manjoo, visited the UK in April 2014, she had strong words of condemnation for the country’s institutional misogyny and sexist popular culture. She projected what many were familiar and frustrated with: the old boys’ network, the pervasive sexualisation of women, the black hole of human rights that women in detention were thrown into. But nothing happened. Instead the headlines bastardised an observation she made on how overt the UK’s sexist culture was, into “UN special rapporteur says UK most sexist country in the world”.Media debates erected straw men, asking if the UK really was worse than Somalia or Saudi Arabia. Edwina Currie asked why Manjoo couldn’t “go to a country where women can’t drive cars, or have maternity leave? There are plenty of countries where women face serious problems.’’ One Daily  blogger argued that, not only is all well, the country is in fact, a “gynocracy” because we’ve had a queen since 1952. Politicians were glad of the misquoted soundbite, and the media was happy to go with it. What was completely missed was that, after a two-week investigation touring prisons and detention centres, and a 4,000-word report, Manjoo raised the alarm, pointing to the disproportionate impact of funding cuts on the provision of services to women and girls at risk of violence. She spelled it out: “Current reforms to the funding and benefits system continue to adversely impact women’s ability to address safety and other relevant issues.”That was more than four years ago. Manjoo’s warnings were drowned. We shot the messenger.This month, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights visited the country, and the results of previous missed opportunities were obvious to him. Philip Alston echoed Manjoo’s concerns, saying that if a “group of misogynists” had drawn up austerity legislation, the results wouldn’t have been too far off where we are today. His report pointed out: “Changes to taxes and benefits have taken the highest toll on those least able to bear it.” And it made clear that the costs of austerity had fallen disproportionately on already vulnerable groups – including women, poor people, ethnic minorities, children, single parents, asylum seekers and people with disabilities.Austerity creates not just poverty, but also what the EHRC calls a “two-speed” society, one where certain groups are trapped, excluded from prosperity. The result is an acceleration of disadvantage. Nearly 400,000 more children and 300,000 more pensioners are living in poverty compared with five years ago.And the more excluded one becomes from society, the more likely one is to become isolated, which means fewer advocates and weaker connections to those in power, who include those who report the news and lobby the government. It is easier for the media and politicians to deny the pain of those who are already invisible. Nowhere is this more clearly shown than in the length of time it took to draw public attention at last to the Windrush scandal, a human rights miscarriage of life-and-death proportions. Predictably and punctually, the denials of Alston’s findings arrived. He was told by the UK government that the social support system was ticking along nicely, and that there was no extreme poverty in the UK because, among other cherry-picked statistics, household incomes were at a record high. This encapsulates the government’s broken logic – to which it holds doggedly despite all contrary evidence – that because some people are becoming better off, then all of us are. If anything, this excuse reifies allegations of a two-tier society, where one half is getting richer while the other is getting poorer, and high walls are erected against the desperate and eyes averted from their suffering.The UK is in a spiral where an irreversible, indisputable calamity has to happen – a Windrush or a Grenfell – before any tragically belated reforms are introduced. Shooting the UN messenger may afford this government temporary relief, but it comes at the expense of the country’s future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fd40861cba53743b72bbea2e963d9de6638a010/0_162_4309_2586/master/4309.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fcf92d5e7f6e5fb10796d0d2fa1f6fb","title":"the c word what are we saying when we talk about cults","story":"All kinds of violent deeds have been perpetrated in the name of religion, from wars to witch-burnings to child sex abuse cover-ups. Why don’t we use the word cult more widely?Cults are hot right now, or so it would seem. One of the bestselling literary debuts of recent years, Emma Cline’s The Girls, tells of a teenage girl’s flirtation with a Manson-like cult in the summer of 1969. American Horror Story’s seventh season, subtitled Cult, delivers a political horror story that references the Manson family and Jonestown alongside Trump and creepy clowns. Netflix viewers binged on the 2018 documentary series Wild Wild Country, with its deliriously cool soundtrack and archival footage of the Rajneeshees – followers of controversial guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.The trend shows signs of continuing, with Quentin Tarantino’s star-studded treatment of the Manson family murders scheduled for release in the summer of 2019 (50 years after the crimes took place), and Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan rumoured to be developing a HBO series based on the Reverend Jim Jones, of Jonestown infamy.As an author whose latest novel, Beautiful Revolutionary, deals with similar subject matter, it’s tempting – even commercially advisable – to ride the cult wave. As a person who has spent time with Jonestown survivors and their families, I’m more ambivalent. What are we really talking about when we talk about cults?Most people have heard of Jonestown and Jim Jones, in some form. Even if the names don’t ring a bell, if you’ve ever seen a fictional depiction of a cult, certain details are likely to be familiar: jungle commune, poisoned fruit punch, paranoid preacher in sunglasses, dead bodies. Tellingly, fewer people have heard of Peoples Temple, the group best known for that 1978 mass murder-suicide of more than 900 of its members in the remote settlement of Jonestown, Guyana. Even fewer have an understanding of what Peoples Temple actually believed in.“Drinking the Kool-Aid” is an idiom that derives from the Jonestown tragedy, commonly used to refer to blind obedience or belief in a flawed idea. Despite this, the fundamental belief of Peoples Temple was equality – hardly a kooky concept. Jonestown wasn’t supposed to be a place of death, but a place where members (the majority of whom were racial minorities) could live free of discrimination.In 2015, I spent two months in the US researching Peoples Temple. I visited Richmond, Indiana, where Jim Jones met his wife, Marceline, in the 1950s, and where her grave is located. I visited 7700 East Road in Redwood Valley, California, where the Peoples Temple church constructed in the late 1960s still stands. I sat in kitchens and coffee shops, talking to people who had lost friends and family in Jonestown, and who could have easily been lost themselves. Some of these conversations continued months later, over email or Skype. Not one of them used the word “cult” in earnest.“We weren’t a cult, we were a social movement,” one survivor made a point of telling me. “We were revolutionaries.”Earlier, the same man had told me about his wife and child dying in his arms. He had told me of his contempt for Jim Jones, the man who ordered their deaths, and who had fostered an atmosphere of such fear and desperation that these orders seemed almost justifiable. He had told me also of his contempt for the current state of US politics, Trump’s racism, sexism and fear-mongering. As far as I could tell, he seemed like a reasonable person, albeit one who had lost a lot.Originally, the word “cult” simply meant “to worship”. Deriving from the same root as “culture” and “cultivation”, it described rituals and offerings intended to cultivate the favour of gods, saints and other holy figures. The term later took on negative connotations, and by the mid-20th century was mostly associated with charlatans and violent or otherwise bizarre fringe groups.Today, a cult might loosely be defined as any group exhibiting a combination of qualities including (but not limited to): a charismatic leader, mind-altering practices, sexual and economic control and exploitation of members, us-versus-them attitudes towards outsiders, and an ends-justify-the-means philosophy.By this definition, it’s difficult to argue that Peoples Temple wasn’t a cult. After all, they had a leader who was notoriously charismatic and who exerted a disproportionate level of control over his congregation. Members were often overworked and overtired, their finances and sex lives regulated by leadership. Relationships with outsiders were generally discouraged, and Jones was known to sexually abuse both male and female followers. Meanwhile, an ends-justify-the-means line of thinking was employed to justify everything from faked healings to the ultimate massacre of more than 900 iniduals.Yet I can understand the impulse of Jonestown survivors, and others, to shy away from the “cult” label. It’s reductive, at best dehumanising, at worst. “Cult is an expression reserved for those religions of which we disapprove,” states Rebecca Moore, a religious studies scholar who lost two sisters and a nephew in Jonestown. When headlines labelled the Jonestown dead “cultists” in the days immediately following the massacre, they relegated them to the sidelines of humanity.This made it easier for the public to distance themselves from the tragedy and its victims, dismissing them as weak, gullible, unsuited to life and unworthy of postmortem respect. Bodies weren’t autopsied. Families were denied the timely return of their relatives’ remains. A thousand “don’t drink the Kool-Aid” jokes were launched.Is the violence of the group’s demise, and our eagerness to distance ourselves from it, ultimately to blame for the persistence of the “cult” label? Certainly, we seldom hear of cults that don’t end catastrophically. Certainly, had Jonestown ended some other way – with Jim Jones dying of natural causes, for instance, and his followers leaving the group or carrying on without him – Peoples Temple would likely be remembered differently. As significant as the violence is, however, all kinds of violent deeds have been perpetrated in the name of religion, from wars to witch-burnings to child sex abuse cover-ups. Why isn’t the C-word applied, in these cases?The association between “cult” and “cool” is a more recent phenomenon. We talk of cult films, cult bands, cult novels, the cult of fitness, Bitcoin and Justin Bieber. It seems that almost anything can be called a cult, provided it has a following – a trend that feels especially meta, given the contemporary craze for cult-related media. Popular true crime podcast My Favorite Murder even went so far as to establish a “Fan Cult”, offering members exclusive content and matching T-shirts at a cost of $39.99 per annum.It’s hard to know what to make of the cult craze. In some ways, it seems to be an extension of our enthusiasm for all things vintage – think “cult”, and you’ll likely think of long hair, folk blouses, a groovy soundtrack – combined with our enduring craving for sex and violence in media. Yet the appeal of stories about people adopting alternative lifestyles, often involving communal living and a return to nature, might be further explained by the frustrations of late-stage capitalist society and growing anxieties about climate change.Whatever the explanation, I believe that the current popularity of cult stories presents an opportunity for these stories to be told differently – more sympathetically, with an emphasis on the humanity of followers rather than just the bloodshed and crazy-charismatic leaders. Because, ultimately, cult stories are human stories. They’re stories of community, the search for meaning and a better life. In such stories, we can all find a bit of ourselves.Laura Woollett is the author of Beautiful Revolutionary (Scribe, $32.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a450f081a1caa5bd105bce570d2ca3937968b5d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a0fca2e7383b2d8e5cd6efb2eab7a1e","title":"i couldnt go to the jobcentre i didnt have a cv building my business as a refugee","story":"When Moh Agha fled the war in Syria and arrived in the UK, he started selling books on ebay to support his family. Now he stocks more than 3,500 items and runs training courses for other refugees. This is how he got back in businessMoh Agha had a lot to take in when he first arrived in the UK with his young family in November 2013. “It’s not easy moving to a new country with a wife and two small children,” he says. “Everything was unfamiliar. We had no friends or family, it was very cold and people spoke very fast and with a strong accent.”After fleeing Syria for Saudi Arabia, the family arrived in the UK. “We moved from London to Bristol, then settled in Wolverhampton,” he says. “It wasn’t easy for me to go to the jobcentre, because I didn’t have a CV I’d always owned my own business. I wanted to open a shop, but it was very expensive because of council tax and business rates. I also found it hard to leave my wife Ranim and my daughters Yara and Amal (now 11 and six) at home alone, because they didn’t speak English. So when I discovered ebay and selling things from home, I realised it could be the solution.”Around this time, by chance, Agha attended a very British institution: the car boot sale. “I met a lady who was trying to sell old books – she had maybe 700 or 800 of them,” he recalls. “She didn’t want to take them home at the end of the day so she was giving them away for free. I took them back to my garage, sorted them out and listed 20 for sale on ebay. The next day all of the books were sold. I then listed the rest and spent the next six months looking around for more. The profit was small, but I was happy to be building a store and getting good feedback.”As Agha and his family began to build up a network of fellow Syrians between Manchester, London and Bristol, he realised that many in his community were struggling to find traditional items they missed from home. “I went to a big wholesaler in London and bought some Syrian kitchenware and house decorations and listed them,” he says. “I made a profit straight away and I realised that there was a real demand there, so I started to import more items from Egypt and Lebanon.”But building up an online store from scratch wasn’t without its challenges. “I’d watch videos explaining how to sell on ebay, but I couldn’t always understand them because they were in English or out of date,” he says. “I realised many people in my community needed these items, but didn’t know about ebay or were not sure how to use it. So I started making videos in Arabic, advertising my items and explaining how to make an ebay account and use PayPal.”Agha’s store, Almaskiya, now stocks 3,500 different items – from prayer mats to copper falafel makers – and he’s not just selling to the Syrian community anymore. “There’s a mould to make sweets that we use every Eid,” he says. “I made a 20-second video explaining how to use it, and now people from Europe are buying it at Christmas and Easter. We have orders for it every day now, actually. And there’s a metal straw that we use to drink tea in the Middle East. The idea came to me that people who drink coffee might want to use it to keep their teeth white. That’s become one of our bestsellers.”The business is growing – “we make a good profit in high season and we cover our costs the rest of the time” – but Agha hasn’t stopped there. “After I made the videos explaining ebay, a lot of people asked me how they could start selling too,” he says. Agha now runs free workshops around the UK for people interested in becoming ebay sellers. “Even though I know these people could become my competitors, I believe that everyone has their own strategy and their own way of doing things – and there’s room for millions of sellers. When I hear people thank me or say: ‘I’m going to pray for you’, or I see them start businesses with a good turnover, I feel proud,” he says. “It’s the best part of my day.” Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

And why should we care? Author of The Multi-Hyphen Method, Emma Gannon, explainsAlex Haddow, a comedian and picture editor, agrees: “I feel that by doing lots of things that pique my interest all the time, I get the most out of everything,” she says. “And because that keeps my interest up, I put more into them and get better results.”At the same time, the internet has given us access to a myriad of free tools and a huge global audience of potential customers and clients, whether using e-commerce hubs such as ebay, or building a following via social media – making many business ideas more viable than before. Not only is it easier to take that first step, but it’s reassuringly non-scary. After all, there’s no risking it all to follow your dreams it is, by definition, a bit on the side. Unsurprisingly, the rise of the multitasking worker comes hand-in-hand with fewer people working in a traditional “job-for-life” role. According to HR organisation the CIPD, around a quarter of workers have been in a job for less than two years, as working on a project-by-project basis lessens the stigma around job-hopping (and creates more impressive-looking CVs).Simultaneously, advances in technology have led to general job security being called into question. I started my side hustle in 2010, when I began to suspect that my magazine job wasn’t going to be around in five years’ time, and have been earning money with a blog and consultancy business ever since. This means we’re quicker to move on and less likely to look back. “I resent the job-for-life notion,” says journalist and volunteer Georgie Bradley. “The idea of clocking in, chaining myself to the desk, then clocking out nine hours later seems soul-destroying.”Researching my book on multi-faceted careers, The Multi-Hyphen Method, I met many more people making side hustling an art. Janet Oganah is a prime example: a former family law barrister, she is now a civil servant and podcaster. “Choosing a multi-hyphenate lifestyle was not an easy decision,” she says. “But it was one of the best ones I have made. I was invested in my legal career I did important work that changed lives. But I was uneasy about relying on one income stream, particularly with the cuts to publicly funded work.” Oganah turned to podcasting as a lucrative, creative way of ersifying her career. For Sally Steel, a teacher who launched a crochet business on ebay, the flexibility was vital for family life: “I wanted to work more creatively and be able to do the school run. I started teaching part-time, building my business while my twins were asleep or at nursery,” she says. “It meant I could spend more time with my children while earning a living. And the happiness I feel at being my own creative boss is worth all the hard work.” This fulfilment is a key factor. For Emma Glass, a paediatric clinical research nurse and author, it’s achieved through the variety of her days. “I feel lucky to have opportunities in both nursing and writing,” she says. “I like working in a clinical environment and with patients, and then spending the evening with publishers and writers and having entirely different experiences within a single day.” Of course, nobody wants to have 17 jobs to make ends meet, and it would be irresponsible to glorify that, but embracing multiple skills to create a modern portfolio career is exciting. We’re told to pick one thing to be good at from our school days, but we all have so many skills and interests. Being a multi-hyphenate answers this, expanding our earning potential and giving us the flexibility to choose how and when we work. After all, says Sarah Kingston, writer, consultant and owner of a marketing agency: “I get to be creative, challenged and excited about what I do. Why have one job title when I can have three?”Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Entrepreneurial experts share their hard-learned lessons, from the genuinely useful to what to avoidDon’t get lost in the crowdYou may think your product is better than everything else, but without something distinctive about it, it’s not going to stand out. “When I do consultancy work occasionally and, say, someone’s made a new T-shirt, I’ll say: ‘What’s so good about it?’” says Kuldip Singh Sahota, founder and chief executive of Mr Singh’s chilli sauces and crisps. “They’ll say, the fabric or design, but that’s what everyone says. What’s going to make you stand out? That’s where your brand and authenticity comes in, especially in such a crowded market.”Dave Bailey, a business coach and entrepreneur, agrees: “When you’re starting a new business, you have to get people to believe what you believe. And they’re never going to believe someone they think is fake or doing it for the wrong reasons.”Do have a good storyIt’s the entrepreneur who can spin a good yarn who gains a head start. For Sahota, that was the chilli sauce recipe his father Hardev “Pops” Singh Sahota had perfected over decades in the family’s shed in east London. They now sell sauces globally.“Everyone loves a good story, don’t they,” says Sahota. “It’s something customers can relate to but also, in our case, it helped us stand out with retailers who we wanted to stock our products.” To highlight the backstory, Sahota cast his father in a series of online comedy music videos to promote the brand.Don’t think all advice is good adviceIf launching a business or a product is like having a baby, entrepreneurs face a similar barrage of well-meaning, often contradictory advice from family, friends and a million business books. “Sarah Wood, the co-founder of the video ad tech company Unruly, once said the best piece of advice she ever got was that advice itself was overrated,” says startups’s Shane Donnelly.Sahota hates the kind of motivational self-help quotes that flood Instagram – “An investment in yourself pays the best interest” and all that sort of thing. “It starts off really well intentioned but it can really get on top of you after a while, so I ignore it all now,” he says.Do ask for experience not advice“A lot of advice is regret in disguise,” Bailey says. “Everyone’s got an experience, but rather than ask for advice, I often recommend asking for that experience.” In other words, not so much “what would you do?” but “what did you do?” – then make your own decision.“The worst advice I got was when I called this big wholesaler in east London and he said: ‘My biggest piece of advice for you is just quit, this is really hard’”, Sahota recalls. “And then he goes: ‘I’ll take a pallet off you if you want.’ And I remember thinking: ‘You told me to quit but you also want a pallet of my sauces? I’ll show you.’”Don’t stick with a product beyond its sell by dateBuilding a product around yourself only enhances your emotional attachment to your baby, but attachment parenting can be bad when things get tricky. “Where people come unstuck is they fall in love with their first creation and stay with it even when the evidence is against it,” says Bailey.“Holding a sentimental attachment to elements that just aren’t working will do your startup no long-term favours,” Donnelly adds.Do go back to the beginningIf sales or interest in your product aren’t what you had hoped, Bailey suggests going back to page one of your story. “Remember what it was that first motivated you,” he says. “What problem were you trying to solve? You have to be open to trying 10 or 20 different solutions and seeing what works.”For Sahota, the first element was working – his sauces were popular and central to his story – but to satisfy investors and progress as a business, he knew the answer was to make his crisps work. “And we should have made that move a lot sooner,” he says. “But I felt like I couldn’t look beyond the sauces unless I was dead.”Don’t look like an amateurIt doesn’t matter how good your story is if you come up short when talk turns serious. “You’ve got to have that nice soft exterior to connect but when you sit down with the supermarket or an investor, they have to know you mean business,” says Sahota. “You need to be able to say: ‘When you put my product on your shelves, I’ll drive customers in to your store because I’ve got followers who want it and I will add value to the category.’ That is hugely important for retailers.”Do ask the right questionsCustomer research is vital for any new business. “But people always ask their customers: ‘Would you use this product that does this cool thing,’” says Bailey. “But that’s a leading question. They’ll say: ‘Yes’ – and that looks like validation. But you should be asking about experience and behaviour.”Knowing how someone lives will help you to see how your product fits into people’s lives.To do this, Bailey suggests directing people to a landing page on your website and setting up a waiting list long before you launch anything, and then having a conversation with those people on the waiting list. “Even if you just get 10 people, that also means they feel the problem you’re trying to solve. And if nobody signs up, that tells you something, too.”Don’t fall into bad habitsKnowing how to structure each day – and what to do – can be tough for a solo starter, particularly one who has come out of an office environment. “You need to create really good habits straight away,” Sahota says. “There’ll be days when it’s really hard and those habits will get you through even if you’ve run out of willpower or motivation.” The sauce entrepreneur sets himself daily goals. “It could be something really simple like sending one really good email to a potential lead and following it with a phone call. On some days it’s good to set your goals low so you feel like you’ve achieved something.”Do take care of number one“Basically, get enough sleep and you’re halfway there,” Bailey says. “I used to work for a big consultancy, working all hours and travelling, and I hated the lifestyle. When I started my first business I was like: ‘I’m going to take my work-life balance seriously.’ Nonetheless, two years later, an investor turns to me during a crisis and says: ‘Dave, here’s what you’re going to do. You’re going to take a holiday for a week and come back to this fresh.’ It was what I needed.”Now you’re well versed in the major dos and don’ts, it’s time to get down to business.

And there is always the temptation to tinker. Food cooked in the oven tends to get on with business itself. Yes, we slide out the Sunday joint to baste it lovingly with the roasting juices and we gingerly test the spring of a cake with a finger, but intervention is less crucial when dinner is cooking behind a closed door.At this time of year I like to put a tray or two of the season’s vegetables and fruits in to bake, some to be eaten whole, others to be transformed into a silky, translucent purée. Wedges of pumpkin and big fat apples, parsnips and pears and Jerusalem artichokes are at their most delicious when they meet the heat of the oven, a little butter and some robust, woody-stemmed herbs. I often cook the ochre roots – carrots, swedes and sweet potatoes – not to eat hot, but to dress with walnut oil and cider vinegar as they come from the oven then tuck away in the fridge. Treasure to plunder over the next few days to be eaten with slices of air-dried hams or smoked mackerel.The flavour is so heightened that I have taken to lightly roasting vegetables and fruit destined for a purée to make the most of their caramelised sweetness. The watchword here is “lightly”. They need to be on the pale side of gold, otherwise their crust will affect the texture of the purée.Apples and pears, whose crisp flesh puffs to a sugary froth in a roasting tin or bakes sweetly under a pastry crust, are useful offerings. Puddings, yes, but also crushed fruit to dip into for breakfast or fold into custard for a fruit fool, whole roasted pears to accompany cold roast pork and chewy crackling or to eat with an amber-coloured cheese or hastily knocked-up caramel sauce for dessert.The flavour of the roast celeriac and Jerusalem artichokes is intensified by a light roasting. The colouring should be no more than a very soft gold.For the mash:celeriac 750gJerusalem artichokes 250gbutter 50ghot vegetable or chicken stock 250mlFor the roast roots:carrots 8, small to mediumparsnips 2garlic 6 clovesbeetroot 4, smallthyme 8 sprigsbutter 75gSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Peel the celeriac and cut it into large pieces, about the size of roast potatoes. Put them in a roasting tin. Peel the Jerusalem artichokes then add to the tin. Dot the butter over the vegetables, season, then roast for about an hour until lightly browned. They mustn’t crisp but instead develop pale gold, lightly caramelised edges. Test for softness – a skewer should slide through with ease.Scrub or peel the carrots and parsnips, cut in half lengthways then put in another roasting tin. Tuck in the garlic cloves, still in their skins, then add the beetroots, trimmed and quartered, with the thyme and butter. Season generously then bake for about an hour, turning once or twice.Tip the roast celeriac and artichokes into a food processor, add some of the stock and reduce to a smooth purée, introducing more of the stock as necessary. Check the seasoning. In a small pan, toast the sunflower seeds over a high heat until they smell nutty, then add the chopped parsley and smoked salt.Spoon the mash on to a serving dish, add the roast vegetables, scatter with the seeds and serve.You only need a small amount of rye bread for the crumble. Use some of the loaf for a stuffing, crumbled into chopped onions softened in butter then mixed with chopped, crisp bacon and pine kernels.For the crust:dark rye bread 100ggolden raisins 6 tbspmixed spice 2 tspbutter 50gcranberries a handfulSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Peel and core two of the apples and two of the pears then cut into thick segments. Put in a roasting tin. Add the cloves, cinnamon and 6 strips of orange peel.Cut the remaining fruit into segments, coring – but not peeling – as you go, and put in a second tin. Scatter both tins with sugar. Halve the lemon and squeeze its juice over, then dot the butter over the fruit. Bake both trays for 45-50 minutes.Crumble the rye bread into a bowl and stir in the golden raisins and mixed spice. Melt the butter in a small pan, add the rye bread mix and toast over a moderate heat. Remove from the heat and set aside.Take the tray of peeled fruit from the oven. Remove the orange peel and spices, then mash or blend the fruit. Transfer the purée to a serving dish.Scatter the cranberries over the other tray in the oven. When the fruit is golden and sticky and the cranberries start to burst, remove from the oven. Spoon the roast fruit over the purée, then scatter with the toasted rye bread."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/857851a351432229c0ab0030c6559b8d39c23e3b/0_203_1238_742/master/1238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3556788e7fd9dea2fe3a5e4304dfa03b","title":"england gareth southgate croatia nations league","story":"With England facing defeat by Croatia, the manager brought on the 18-year-old winger Jadon Sancho and the world turnedNever throw anything away. That was the lesson from this fun, late-breaking England victory. On an unexpectedly epic afternoon at Wembley, Croatia were beaten by an England 2.0 team who decided to muss their hair, throw the briefcase out the window, create a little chaos with long throws and free-kicks and win, in the end, a bit like England 1.0.There was a wonderful note of theatre about the finish. As the sun dipped below the lip of the Wembley roof England were 1-0 down then, at 1-1, five minutes from relegation for the first time in their history – and indeed at the very first opportunity. One slightly wild attacking surge later and England are now marching on instead to (it says here) Portugal for a semi-final against whoever December’s Uefa draw at the home of football (AKA the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin) decides to throw their way.Yes, it’s the good old Nations League. And yes, there will be a standard reflex to trash the competition, to suggest there may be something a little cartoonish about this peculiar little Euro mini-league.Never mind all that for now though. On a bright, bellicose afternoon England’s 2-1 victory provided three significant notes of happiness. First, this counts as the best England moment in just over 10 years at the new Wembley, a rare old bloom of shared euphoria for a crowd that has so often been grizzly and disaffected.International football needs these moments, feeds off the sense of its own importance. Without this it quickly loses its way. The crowd was notably young, shrill and unscarred by all those dreary days watching dreary teams of drearily entitled Premier League players, the real threat to the enduring relevance of this form of football. Memories were made here, snapshots of happiness clipped and preserved. They will be back for more.There was also a hidden note of catharsis after the disappointments of the World Cup, an oddly unsettling little glimpse of how it might have been. At the final whistle it was Croatia’s players who sank to the turf distraught. The St George’s flags waved. Gareth Southgate punched the air, then collected himself a little self-consciously. Football’s Coming Home boomed over the PA.Finally, and most important, there was evidence of how hard Southgate has worked to trim the edges from an already successful team. It was there in England’s lineup, even if initially it failed to fire. The last time England played Croatia the midfield was eventually overrun, Jordan Henderson asked to gallop about after Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic like a faithful old horse competing its daily circuit of the back-field paddock.Here Southgate plumped five months too late for the double-midfield shield, protecting a flat back four with Eric Dier and Fabian Delph, the England midfield equivalent of a pair of brawny-shouldered piano removal men. Ross Barkley played well for 10 minutes, then faded, but his presence also made sense. The lack of invention in midfield was an obvious blot at the World Cup. It was a blot here too but Barkley can offer creativity and started ahead of Dele Alli. Southgate has spoken of being ruthless, of showing his fangs, of seeking to promote a constant revolution. It is what winning teams do.One of the criticisms of this generation of refined, academy-fed England players has been the lack of a more instinctive razor edge. They said something similar in Germany before their own well-schooled generation won the World Cup. For a while this might have been the story: the same story as before, which is in itself a very England kind story.Croatia went ahead though Andrej Kramaric. The prospect of another almost-but-not-quite loomed. At which point something different happened. England threw off the weeds of caution, Southgate brought on an 18-year-old winger for the last 17 minutes. At the end England had five attacking players and a pair of flying full-backs on the pitch, and had fielded 11 players under the age of 25. As they threw everything they had at Croatia’s defence, often without much precision, you half expected one of Wembley hospitality’s charcoal grey graphite composite catering sinks to come hurtling out through the club Wembley windows. Jesse Lingard, a sub, got the equaliser. Kane poached a significant winner, his 20th goal in his 35th game.And so England are on their way to Porto or Guimarães, just as both Porto and Guimarães will perhaps have already taken a gulp and had a few furtive thoughts about the prospect of England’s fans turning up for a week in early June next year for their first post-Brexit double-header. By then Southgate’s England could have kicked on again from here, finding new forms and new shapes, but hopefully retaining, as they did here, something old and agreeably ragged to go with the poise of the new era."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherOur notion of the traditional household is changing.

A cluster of journalists gathered on the mezzanine while below them visitors filtered past signs for She Lase and Zero Gravity Skin and a stand for a company called Eurosilicone that claims to have been “Empowering women for over 30 years”. At the far end of the conference hall, a woman was having her jawline enhanced with fillers in front of a rapt crowd the Safety in Beauty stand was empty.Back on the mezzanine, there was a rustle of suits as the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) entered the room. Apologies for the delay, one said solemnly, there has been another death. A second British woman has died this year after a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL). Which made their announcement that they were henceforth warning surgeons not to perform the procedure particularly urgent. The brief was called “The Bottom Line”.Bottoms are big business in 2018. For a generation whose mothers spent mornings trying to shrink their thighs in front of Jane Fonda videos, today there is no such thing as a bum that’s too big. The perfect body has changed every decade over the past century, stretching and curving over time like a time-lapse sand dune.Body parts have come in and out of fashion depending on the mainstream obsessions of the moment, from the lean boyish chests of flappers in the 1920s, signifying liberation from corsetry, through 30s bosoms and 40s legs, to the sexualised femininity of Marilyn Monroe’s hourglass figure, and on eventually to 80s muscles (Power! Strength!), and 90s, well, bones. Extreme slenderness was maintained beyond the millennium, but with added breasts, a modified Monroe, minus the tummy.“Big bums are now associated with women with attitude and a sway who are non-white, which is desired,” says Susie Orbach, the psychotherapist who has been analysing women’s relationships to their bodies for more than 40 years.In 2012, I spoke to a group of 20-year-olds about the media pressure to change their bodies. Rather than extreme thinness, they said the pressure was to look sexy. “Everyone wants to look like Kim Kardashian, not Kate Moss. Curves, not bones.” Which sounded like a positive development, a move away from disordered eating and dangerous attempts at control, until they pointed out that it also requires a tiny waist. You can starve yourself bony, but “the sexy body is much more unattainable”.And then came the deaths, 33 of them in the US following complications from BBLs in the last five years.Instagram, that seductive hellmouth where women holiday in their lunchbreaks, contributes to the growth of bums in a number of ways. There are the celebrities, yes, sharing their “belfies”. There is the fetishisation of the bodies of black and Latina women. Kim Kardashian’s 2014 naked shoot by Jean-Paul Goude for Paper magazine, arguably the launchpad for the body trend that is today called “thicc”, was inspired by Goude’s (who is white) 1976 portrait of Carolina Beaumont, who is black the portrait was published in his book Jungle Fever.In 2014, American Vogue declared the big bum on trend... for white women: as soon as a trend goes mainstream, women of colour are eliminated from the story. “So common is the process, it has its own Twitter hashtag,” wrote Yomi Adegoke. “#Columbising – when, like Christopher Columbus, white people think they have discovered something that was already in existence.” There is that. There is also the rise of “body positivity”, of women sharing pictures of curves they’d been taught were shameful. And there is Instagram as a platform for cosmetic surgeons to advertise directly at women who, tipsy on the combination of insecurity and images of arses as empowerment, will click through to adjust their own.The latest post from Elite Aftercare, a clinic in Turkey (home of medical tourism) is a headless portrait of a happy customer, photographed from the front and from behind and tagged #BBL, #choices and #mybody. Scroll through to September, and there’s an update about a post-mortem on another of its patients, Leah Cambridge. She was a mother of three from Leeds, who, following this procedure, died on the operating table in August.At the Expo’s press briefing, the BAAPS doctors discussed a study analysing one London hospital where, since 2013, they’d seen a six-fold rise in cases needing urgent follow-up care from procedures done abroad. Complications from BBLs ranged from severe bacterial infections to tissue dying, scarring, wound ruptures and abscesses. One patient had a “flesh-eating” infection. BBLs have the highest death rate (conservatively, 1 in 3,000 operations) of all cosmetic surgery procedures, due to the risk of injecting fat into large veins that can travel to the heart or brain. In August, a celebrity Brazilian cosmetic surgeon, Instagram name Dr Bumbum, was charged with murdering one of his patients. Dr Denis Furtado had performed an operation on Lilian Calixto to enlarge her buttocks in his own flat. He had nearly 650,000 followers.“A vulnerable group of patients are openly being targeted through social media,” said outgoing BAAPS president Simon Withey, “to travel abroad for cheaper cosmetic surgery – and this trend is likely to rise.” On Instagram, foreign clinics offer British customers “mummy makeovers”, and deals where the flight is free if you buy multiple operations – everywhere they promise that clients will feel “empowered”.Their glamorous imagery is in stark contrast to the photos accompanying an NHS report on the wall at the Expo, about the complications of cosmetic surgery abroad, one of which shows a buttock abscess being drained. “Hot!” choked a security guard, walking by.It’s not just cosmetic surgeons who claim they can empower women. For those who felt their bodies had been dismissed and sneered at for decades, but now find their arses the height of fashion, the big butt trend has been sold by the body positive movement as a step towards a more erse body acceptance. But… can body trends ever be a good thing? “The move towards bigger bums isn’t a good thing,” says Orbach, “It’s a thing. What may at first seem to mirror some women’s previously excluded experience simultaneously excludes other women, which would be OK if commerce weren’t riding on it and suggesting that big bums are the solution.”While fatalities are the most headline-grabbing result of Britain’s new pursuit of the bigger bottom, the implications of a changing obsession are less shocking, and more depressing. A realisation. Women will never be comfortable in their bodies, because the goal posts of what is acceptable keep shifting. We are encouraged to remain constantly at war with ourselves, shrinking, growing and utilising all the evolving technology that claims to alleviate the same anxiety that, simply by existing, it continues to feed us. And, to do so – to try and create your own Kardashian butt – is a rational reaction in 2018. The alternative is to be irrelevant, unbeautiful, and therefore, unseen.“Bodies and the surface are not our only calling card,” Orbach adds. “We are not brands, but people who can contribute and challenge and dare to live from our unique bodies, not facsimile ones.”Whew. All this from a bum. How did we get here? How did we get here from something that seemed so simple, so positive, so cheeky? A punchline, an inherently funny aspect of being human? An arse, we’re learning, is never just an arse. This is a trend we may need to sit on for a while.The costs, risks and significant rise of the Brazilian Butt Lift• A Brazilian Butt Lift, or BBL, is the colloquial term for buttock fat grafting, an elective cosmetic procedure which can cost up to £8,000 (in the UK) and involves removing fat from one part of the body via liposuction and transplanting it via injection into the buttocks, for a fuller effect.• The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) said it was the most dangerous cosmetic procedure to undergo. Gerard Lambe, consultant plastic surgeon, explains: ‘It has the highest death rate of all procedures due to the risk of injecting fat into large veins in the buttocks, that can then travel to the heart or brain.’• About one in every 3,000 BBL patients worldwide has died of a pulmonary fat embolism. Twice as many developed chronic or serious complications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

She was found guilty of spying and given a five-year jail sentence. She denies the allegations, and her plight has left a shadow hanging over Iran-UK relations.In August, she was granted a three-day release from Evin prison but her request for an extension was denied and she was forced to say goodbye to her four-year-old daughter, Gabriella, and return to jail, where she had a panic attack. Her family have decided not to apply for further temporary releases because of the tremendous strain she has suffered.Before his meeting with the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, Hunt said: “More than anything, we must see those innocent British-Iranian dual nationals imprisoned in Iran returned to their families in Britain. I have just heard too many heartbreaking stories from families who have been forced to endure a terrible separation. So I arrive in Iran with a clear message for the country’s leaders: putting innocent people in prison cannot and must not be used as a tool of diplomatic leverage.”Hunt has twice met Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard, promising him that he would leave no stone unturned in order to secure her release.There had been hopes that Hunt’s takeover of the foreign office from Boris Johnson in August, coupled with the British decision to stick with the Iran nuclear deal in the face of sustained US pressure, might prompt Tehran to release Zaghari-Ratcliffe on compassionate grounds.Hunt’s visit will be the first by a European foreign minister since the US pulled out of the deal, although Zarif has met EU ministers in Vienna to urge Europe to do more to protect European firms still seeking to trade with Iran from the effect of American sanctions.The US pulled out of the deal signed by Barack Obama in 2015, saying it was full of holes, and announced it would impose sanctions, including fines and asset freezes, on the US arm of any European company seeking to continue to trade with Iran.Brian Hook, the US special representative for Iran, last week expressed confidence that almost no European firms were willing to risk US sanctions. A succession of companies have pulled out of planned investments in Iran, leaving some medium-sized organisations with no US operations to assess the risk of continuing to trade.The British decision to side with France and Germany has caused a rift with Washington. Theresa May was reportedly rebuked by Donald Trump in a bad-tempered phone call, initiated by May to congratulate the US president for the midterm election results. The final tranche of US sanctions on Iran, including sanctions on any country importing Iranian oil, came into force on 5 November.The UK – unlike the US – believes the economic pressure being applied by the US on Iran will not force the country to reopen the deal, and – if anything – will strengthen Iranian hardliners.Some leading Republicans are convinced that the Iranian regime is close to collapse, and Hunt’s visit will be a brief chance to test that assessment.Hunt will stress that the UK remains committed to the nuclear deal as long as Iran sticks to its terms, and will discuss European efforts to maintain nuclear-related sanctions relief. The UK has said that because of Brexit it cannot host the EU’s proposed special purpose vehicle, a device that could enable companies to continue to trade with Iran but avoid US sanctions. It is not clear if any country is willing to risk sanctions by hosting the SPV, a serious blow to Europe’s efforts to show its independence from US foreign policy.Hunt will also discuss Yemen, and underline his concern at reports, documented by the UN panel of experts, that Iran has supplied ballistic missiles and weapons to the Houthis, in violation of security council resolutions. The UK will table a draft resolution at the UN security council on Monday setting out the plans for a ceasefire leading to talks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a980d8e8fdfefb9b6f1ea304ba6496383f5b4c9/0_40_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d4e639bc2ef91805b2dcdb99dfc811b","title":"the legacy of islamic state in iraq","story":"Two years on from the ‘liberation’ of Fallujah from Isis control, the ’s Peter Beaumont has returned to the Iraqi city.

His idea would allow an extra two years to negotiate a trading relationship, but means the UK would continue to follow EU rules and pay into its budget with no say for six and a half years after the 2016 vote to leave.Both sides have already agreed a transition period of 21 months, until the end of 2020, as well as the chance to extend once by mutual consent. The length of the extension is still to be finalised by negotiators.The transition period, which the British government prefers to call the implementation period, would see the UK following all EU laws and European court of justice rulings, while having no ministers or MEPs in the EU decision-making process.Theresa May has previously suggested an extension of only a few months would be needed, but the EU is still waiting on the UK to make a formal proposal.Negotiations between the EU and UK were continuing on Sunday as Brexit talks entered a critical final week, ahead of a special summit on 25 November when both sides hope to seal the deal.The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u0026nbspThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u0026nbspThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u0026nbspThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u0026nbspThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u0026nbspBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u0026nbsp a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.\u0026nbspStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u0026nbspEuropean court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u0026nbspWhile Westminster remains in political turmoil, with leading Brexiters angling to send the prime minister back to Brussels to renegotiate the 585-page withdrawal treaty, the EU regards the text as finalised.European leaders have zero appetite to reopen talks, despite some unhappiness about the customs union being offered to the UK as an insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While certain member states would certainly like to see more, they have to swallow it for now,” one diplomat said.The ambassadors did not discuss the cost of a transition extension – the UK’s net contribution to the EU budget was £9.6bn in 2016, but would have been £14.5bn without the rebate. The EU has previously said the UK would no longer be entitled to the rebate after 2020.At the meeting, Spain voiced unhappiness about the status of Gibraltar, but EU sources were not expecting Madrid to stand in the way of an agreement. Spain has publicly welcomed the deal on Gibraltar, but its minority government is under pressure from opposition parties over the status of the dependency.Instead, EU member states are focusing their attention on the statement on future relations, a political declaration that is expected to be released on Tuesday. France is taking a strict approach to avoid any watering down of the EU’s four freedoms, while economically liberal countries, such as the Netherlands and the Baltic states, are looking for a more ambitious text.Ministers from EU27 will meet in Brussels on Monday to give further input into the document, which is due to be signed off at the Brexit summit next Sunday.May said she would be travelling to Brussels to meet the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, this week, but her announcement has not been confirmed in Brussels. “President Juncker is of course ready to meet PM May once the negotiations on the political declaration have advanced in a decisive manner,” a commission spokesman said. “Work on this is ongoing between the negotiators,” he said, adding it was “too early to say when a meeting could take place”.The president of Britain’s employers’ organisation said that while Barnier’s intentions in proposing an extension may have been constructive, such an announcement “may not be particularly helpful” at this point in time. John Allan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think he’s trying to be helpful and trying to reduce the risk that the backstop will be needed. Him saying it just at this moment may not be particularly helpful, but I think his intentions are probably good.“We all hope it won’t be necessary, that the discussions on our future economic relationship with the EU will be concluded by the end of 2020 and within the existing transition period.“But remember, that transition period only comes into effect if parliament approves the withdrawal agreement.

After Corbyn told Der Spiegel Labour “can’t stop Brexit” last week (allies later said he meant they could not do so alone), the Luton MP Gavin Shuker described it as a “moment of betrayal”, of “those the Labour party was first established to protect”, and said it “will not be forgotten for generations”.If an election does come, Labour is relying on the Tories being so ided and discredited that Corbyn will sweep to No 10 but drawing up a manifesto, let alone fighting the campaign, would expose deep isions on his own side, too.For a small number of MPs, it could even precipitate the decision they have been mulling over for a long time – to leave Labour altogether.The stakes are highest for Theresa May over the coming weeks, but Labour strategists know they must do more than simply sit back and watch the Tories fail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ccae4e9a3347291554abfbd8383e5078c73728/107_0_1683_1010/master/1683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ab4b489ddb61b36bbf971c595a51af2","title":"jeremy corbyn to set out labour alternative to pms brexit plan","story":"Corbyn will tell business leaders a ‘good Brexit plan’ must include ‘radical programme of investment and real change’Jeremy Corbyn will set out Labour’s “good Brexit plan” on Monday, saying that leaving the European Union must be the catalyst for a “radical programme of investment and real change” as the party steps up efforts to show it has an alternative to Theresa May’s approach.Speaking to business leaders at the CBI’s annual conference in London, which will also be addressed by the prime minister, Corbyn will claim May’s deal, published last week, would “leave the country in an indefinite halfway house without a real say over our future”.Instead, he will say, “a good Brexit plan for this country is not just about what can be negotiated with Brussels. It must also include a radical programme of investment and real change across our regions and nations.“Brexit should be the catalyst to invest in our regions and infrastructure, bringing good jobs and real control to local communities and people.”His words are likely to infuriate those Labour MPs who believe the party’s stance should be to seek to block Brexit by pressing for a referendum on May’s deal – with the option of remaining in the EU on the ballot paper.Corbyn played down that suggestion on Sunday, telling Sky News’ Sophy Ridge: “It’s an option for the future, but it’s not an option for today. If there was a referendum tomorrow, what’s it going to be on, what’s the question going to be?”Asked how he might vote in such a referendum, Corbyn said, “I don’t know how I am going to vote, what the options would be at that time.”In his speech to the CBI, Corbyn will set out the key elements of what he will call Labour’s “sensible” approach.Instead of the temporary customs arrangement May has signed up to as a backstop, to prevent a hard border in Ireland, Corbyn will underline Labour’s backing for a permanent customs union.He will stress the need for workers’ rights and environmental standards to be protected to prevent a “race to the bottom”.And he will call for “a strong single market relationship that allows British business continued access to European markets for both goods and services – while also ensuring we have the powers to support our public services and industry and transform the economy in all our regions and nations.”Labour believes it needs to have something to offer its supporters in heavily leave-voting seats, regarding their backing for Brexit not just as a rejection of unfettered immigration but as a demand for economic change.When May brings her final deal back to parliament, expected to be early next month, Labour will whip its MPs to vote against it. Then, if the deal is rejected by parliament, the party will demand the opportunity to pursue its own alternative approach.“If the prime minister is unable to negotiate an agreement that can win a majority in parliament and work for the whole country, Labour’s alternative plan can and must take its place,” Corbyn will say on Monday.But it is as yet unclear how Labour could secure enough support from MPs to push its own proposals.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, will address Labour MPs at the regular meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday night and urge MPs to hold their nerve in the face of the threat that rejecting May’s deal would result in a no-deal Brexit.Corbyn, a longstanding critic of the EU, was asked by Ridge whether Labour was offering enough leadership over Brexit and whether it could play a bigger role in coordinating those opposed to the government’s withdrawal agreement.He replied: “There was a referendum in 2016, a majority voted to leave the EU, there are many reasons why people voted. I don’t think you call a referendum and then say you don’t like the result and go away from it. You’ve got to understand why people voted and negotiate the best deal you can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89f81e962cec6a97245c3ebde18a7f7f5cb7e704/0_167_4630_2778/master/4630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ab1950d333d7c623f5de4eb5f9396fc","title":"scientists unravel secret of cube shaped wombat faeces","story":"Researchers investigate why excrement emerges in awkward-shaped blocksOf all the many mysteries that surround the common wombat, it is hard to find one as baffling as its ability – broadly acknowledged as unique in the natural world – to produce faeces shaped like cubes.Why the pudgy marsupials might benefit from six-faced faeces is generally agreed upon: wombats mark their territorial borders with fragrant piles of poo and the larger the piles the better. With die-shaped dung, wombats boost the odds that their droppings, deposited near burrow entrances, prominent rocks, raised ground and logs, will not roll away. That, at least, is the thinking.But quite how the animals produce the awkward-shaped blocks – and they can pass up to 100 per night, presumably with some trepidation – has proved a harder one to work out. Scientists who find themselves intrigued by the phenomena have made little progress beyond ruling out the nagging suspicion that the animals possessed square anuses.“My curiosity got triggered when I realised that cubical feces exist,” said Patricia Yang, a postdoctoral fellow in mechanical engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. “I thought it was not true in the first place.”In a new study, Yang and her colleagues have had a fresh crack at the problem. To gain new insights into the mystery, they studied the digestive tracts of common wombats that had been euthanised after being struck by cars and trucks on roads in Tasmania.In work to be presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society’s fluid dynamics ision in Georgia, the team explain how the last section of the wombat intestine does not stretch evenly, unlike the rest of the intestine. When measured around the circumference, some parts give more than others. This allows the intestine to deform in such a way that packs faeces into 2cm-wide cubes rather than the usual sausage shapes. The findings were buoyed up by tests on pig intestines which found no such irregularities in how those stretched.“Wombat intestines have periodic stiffness, meaning stiff-soft-stiff-soft, along the circumference to form cubical faeces,” Yang said.But the researchers have yet to finish the job. To produce a poo with a square cross-section, the circumference of the intestine would need four stretchy regions interspersed with four stiff regions. That way, the stiff regions form the flat faces, while the stretchier parts allow corners to form. The balloon tests revealed only three stretchy parts and two stiffer ones. In an upcoming paper, the scientists suggest that the other stiff and stretchy bits may only become apparent when they can inflate the intestines to a larger size. In other words, strain a little harder.Yang believes that the revelation will have implications beyond the small community of researchers who admit an interest in wombat scat. Today, engineers have only two methods for making cubes: either moulding them or cutting them, she points out. The wombat’s intestines suggest a third route is possible. “It would be a cool method to apply to the manufacturing process,” she said.“We can learn from wombats and hopefully apply this novel method to our manufacturing process. We can understand how to move this stuff in a very efficient way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8a06320e2b2fb42f10083fe02da6a2d9e12052a/0_0_2400_1438/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66271e1ebe4d846a3d3b3bb21d832925","title":"can you solve it five shady puzzles","story":"Shine your inner light bulb on these geometrical gemsToday’s puzzles are about the shade, by which I mean the shaded areas in the geometrical diagrams below.

But we are still a long way off from making our way to the red planetSpace flight is now a venerable industry. Humanity’s first space explorer, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, orbited around the globe on 12 April 1961, more than half a century ago, when Britain remained a colonial power and people were still using halfpennies to buy their fish and chips.Since then, more than 550 people have blasted themselves into the deep black abyss, although not all agree on how far up you need to go until you hit space, so there is no internationally accepted figure. Only a 10th of those have been women, in big part due to sexist policies by Nasa and Russia’s Roscosmos space agency.The Soviet Union pulled ahead with the first space walks, but US president John F Kennedy’s announcement that America would put a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s focused the space race squarely on that goal. Apollo 11 touched down on our dusty grey neighbour on 20 July 1969.A total of 12 men walked on the moon over the next few years, all Americans, but no one has been back there since 1972. In fact, no one has left the outskirts of the Earth since then.We imagine astronauts floating in free space or bouncing in moon craters, yet the majority of those lucky enough have instead spun around in low Earth’s orbit – between 99 and a few hundred miles high. That’s where the vast array of communications and navigation satellites live, speeding at thousands of miles an hour to avoid plummeting back to earth.Even though we did not go back to deep space, humans have begun to live and work outside the Earth’s atmosphere, often conducting experiments on themselves to determine the effects of weightlessness, or microgravity, on the human body.By 1986, the Soviet Union had launched the Mir space station. When it eventually fell to Earth (thankfully unoccupied) and burned up, our current space outpost, the International Space Station (ISS), was launched. Since 2000, humans have been living in space constantly. There are three up there at the moment, speeding around the globe once every 90 minutes.A lot, and until we properly understand how weightlessness affects humans, we won’t be able to send this era’s pioneers further afield to places such as Mars or wandering asteroids. Scott Kelly, a US former fighter pilot and long-time Nasa astronaut, spent a year bouncing around the cramped capsules of the ISS in an attempt to understand the long-term impact of space flight. He doesn’t hold the record for the most extended foray into the void – that is claimed by Gennady Padalka, who spent two and half years of his life up there on several missions – but the Kelly experiment had a natural advantage over others: he has a twin.Comparing their bodies throughout, scientists were able to assess how bones, muscles and other parts of the body deteriorate in space. There is even a gym on the ISS where astronauts can keep their muscles – no longer needed to prop them up – from slowly wasting away. But they need to wear a harness to keep them from floating off the treadmill. One big issue is that eye problems develop, but Kelly found his body recovered fast on return. He and his twin seemed in similar shape – good news for future deep space missions.Only three countries, China, Russia and the US, have human space programmes as it remains prohibitively expensive. However, they have provided lifts for space travellers from 40 countries, including a member of the Saudi royal family and even paying customers, such as South African millionaire Mark Shuttleworth, aged just 28.Astronomical. The ISS is the most expensive machine ever constructed with a price tag at around $150bn (£115bn). Nasa’s space shuttle programme, which kicked off in the early 1970s by promising safe and affordable access to space, hoped to cost just a few tens of million dollars per launch. But as the shuttle was thrown in the scrapyard in 2011, the agency estimated the total cost at $209bn — nearly $1.6bn per flight.Following the big fight over the shuttle, which looked fantastic but also restricted space adventuring to Earth’s orbit as well as costing a fortune, the US took a side seat in launches. Most astronauts are now sent by the Russian space agency, which sells round-trip rides on its Soyuz spacecraft for between $21m and $82m.Anyone involved in space travel will scoff at this, but it’s a good question, and space agencies often don’t communicate their achievements enough. Almost every sector of human progress has benefited from sending people into space. Just the act of attempting the feat forced scientists to invent new systems. The Apollo guidance computer was a predecessor to the microcomputer, now found in all smartphones. Clothes are more fire-resistant because of research on space fires. Remotely monitoring the health of astronauts has led to revolutionary systems for helping patients on Earth. Diseases behave and develop differently in microgravity, which assists scientists in finding cures.The first space race was part of the chest-beating of the cold war, but since then human space exploration has been more about countries working together than against each other. The ISS is a massive collaboration between five space agencies (Nasa, Roscosmos, Japan’s Jaxa, the pan-European agency ESA and the Canadian Space Agency) and was assembled over a period of 13 years from 1998, slowly adding capsules like Lego.A big exception to this is China, which has gone it alone with its space ambitions, never sending an astronaut to the ISS. In 2006, Beijing reportedly tested lasers against US imaging satellites in what appeared to be an attempt to blind or damage them, and US lawmakers later banned cooperation between Nasa and China’s state agency.However, the future of any effective human space flight is certainly likely to be cooperative rather than antagonistic. Since 2011, national spaces agencies in 14 countries have attempted to coordinate their dreams into a single vision. The most recent plan, published in January this year, said they had agreed to “expand human presence into the solar system, with the surface of Mars as a common driving goal”.Don’t start the countdown just yet. To get to Mars, most people in the human space flight community feel we need to first go back to the moon. “It’s the only logical step,” says Ian Crawford, professor of planetary science and astrobiology at Birkbeck, University of London. “I’m all in favour of sending people to Mars, but the technology, competence, the experience – I think it’s still out of reach”.The moon has several advantages. It’s only three days away, rather than a several-month round trip to Mars, and has been touted as a location for a research station similar to the one in Antarctica. From their celestial laboratory, scientists could study the impact of radiation exposure and near-weightlessness on the body at a closer distance to Earth, but still within deep space, all while preparing for trips further afield.Well. Not quite either. The Global Exploration Roadmap suggests first building a space station as an orbital base from which to send astronauts back and forth to the moon. This will look similar to the ISS except, instead of rushing around the Earth, it will orbit the moon.It is a mammoth feat and it would be wise to expect serious delays. “Where we go in space is decided by a combination of what people would like to do and the reality of time and budgets,” says Henry Hertzfeld, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, Washington DC, and a former policy analyst at Nasa. “The idea of putting people on Mars has been around for a long time. If you read the policies, it is clearly a long-term vision without a date. But we probably are still lacking the technology to keep people for a long time in deep space.”The US and Russia have been giving way to new players. In 2003, China became the third country to put a person into orbit and India plans to follow in 2022. But the sector-changing impact is undoubtedly coming from the private space.In what is being coined the “billionaire’s space race”, Elon Musk, founder of Telsa electric cars, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Virgin boss Richard Branson all want to send private citizens to space. Their companies, SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, are set on making human space travel cheaper.They join a handful of commercial space flight companies that already work as contractors for national space agencies. Aerospace industry titans Boeing and Lockheed Martin send heavy launchers into space, but that costs at least $350m per launch – several times more expensive than SpaceX’s new $90m Falcon Heavy system.SpaceX has around $10bn worth of launches already booked and saves costs through reusable spacecraft, where even the rocket boosters land themselves back on the ground and can be dusted off for reuse.And while it is looking increasingly likely that the ISS will be defunded in the next decade, several private ventures are considering either taking over or rebuilding their own space stations.As government agencies prioritise the moon, others are looking straight at Mars. Musk has said his life goal is to create a thriving Mars colony as a fail-safe for humanity in case of a catastrophic event on Earth, such as a nuclear war or Terminator-style artificial intelligence coup. For this, SpaceX is developing the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), which he claims could send crewed flights to the red planet by mid-2020.Musk says the BFR is partly inspired by Tintin’s rocket and will be the biggest ever made at close to 40 storeys high and capable of ferrying as many as 100 passengers per trip, depending on how much luggage they want to put in the hold.As well as a healthy satellite launch business, SpaceX is raising money by selling tickets on the BFR for a trip, some would say a jolly, around the moon. Yusaku Maezawa, a Japanese fashion billionaire and art collector, is funding such a mission slated for 2023 and says he is going to invite artists with him for the week-long trip to re-engage the public in the wonder of our universe.An astronaut’s guide to life on Earth, Chris HadfieldTo space and back, Sally RideEndurance: A year in space, a lifetime of discovery, Scott Kelly"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ec51e6669ce9ec4dbe4990cc815d1fd65b34d2/0_0_5303_3183/master/5303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91d1239d41970c35baecc0d83c4da6de","title":"letting children try alcohol at home wont deter binge drinking say uk experts","story":"Campaign dispels myth that introducing alcohol earlier encourages adult moderation Parents are being urged to delay the moment their child first drinks alcohol because it can damage the growing brain.The idea that introducing your child to alcohol, for example with a glass of wine at the dinner table, will take away the novelty and deter binge drinking is a myth, say experts. Too many people still believe that families drinking together in France keeps children safe, when actually the county’s rates of alcohol dependence and binge drinking exceed those in the UK.The warning comes from health campaigners in the north-east of England, who have launched a campaign aimed at parents called What’s the Harm, backed by experts across the UK.Guidance from the chief medical officer says an alcohol-free childhood and youth up to the age of 18 is healthiest – and that no child should be drinking at all before they turn 15. However, this advice from 2009, which was confirmed in 2016, is not widely known, said Colin Shevills, the director of Balance, an alcohol awareness group funded by 12 local authorities in north-east England.“Only one in 20 adults is aware of it,” he said. “Clearly, a lot of myths are flourishing in the absence of strong campaigns. The government has not been doing enough to make people aware of the harms of alcohol for adolescents or children.”“Parents have a right to know about all of the alcohol harms which children face if they drink. Every parent wants the best for their child and we know it can be hard knowing what is the right thing to do around alcohol,” said Shevills.“However, we know from speaking to north-east parents there’s a myth that providing alcohol at a young age makes children less curious, when in fact it can be a trigger for drinking. People mention the French way of giving children alcohol – but France actually has twice the rate of alcohol dependence of the UK.”It is safer for children to drink in the home, if they are drinking, he said, but parents are entitled to know the damage that alcohol can cause and be empowered to argue against a teenager who says that “everybody else does it”.Alcohol affects children faster than adults, said Dr John Green, a GP in Prudhoe, Northumberland. “Medical evidence is clear that drinking can also affect the normal development of children’s vital organs and functions, including the brain, liver, bones and hormones. It is also linked to their mental health, can lead to feelings of depression among children and it can also affect their performance at school,” he said.More and more young people are choosing not to drink and they need to be supported, said Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, the chair of the UK’s Alcohol Health Alliance. “Myths suggesting providing alcohol to your child will stop them having problems are much more prevalent and people have a right to know the facts.“This campaign from Balance sets out to help parents with an issue many of us have had to tackle. It will help empower parents to make decisions about alcohol which will give their children the best start in life and I would urge the government to look at how it can be replicated across the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38e3240504cb802464a346354d8c251dc7585aa3/0_125_3172_1904/master/3172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4da07165fb4a4415494cc53a20f73953","title":"katy daley mclean helps england over line after canada revival","story":"• England 27-19 Canada• Daley-Mclean comes off the bench to steady EnglandEngland’s women, who had blown the USA away in a gale nine days earlier, were forced to dig deeper in the sunshine in Doncaster on Sunday.The Red Roses left the white rose county with a second victory of their three-match autumn series but Canada, ranked fourth in the world, threatened an upset on the hour when they drew to within three points of England, who had earlier breezed into a 15-0 lead.A try in the last move of the match from Canada’s lock Courtney Holtkamp put a bit of a gloss on the scoreline but the Canadians, well marshalled by their hooker Laura Russell and including four of the side beaten by England in the final of the 2014 World Cup, were never going to make it an easy afternoon for Simon Middleton’s side.The England coach had made 10 changes to the starting side from the win over the USA, including the return to the back row of his captain Sarah Hunter.Things seemed to be going according to plan when the England pack submerged the visitors with wave after wave of relentless driving mauls in the first 25 minutes, two of them bringing tries for the hooker Lark Davies and another for the Saracens flanker Poppy Cleall.But with Lucy Attwood missing all three conversions to stretch the lead, Canada bounced back. Their centre Alex Tessier scored a well-taken try just before the break after a clever kick over the English defence from Anais Holly.After the interval Canada somehow survived some intense pressure from the England pack and scored a spectacular try in front of a disbelieving Castle Park crowd.Canada’s full-back Elissa Alarie intercepted a pass from Rachael Burford in her own 22 and ran a lung-bursting 90 metres pursued by the England wing Kelly Smith to score in the corner.Ten minutes later Smith had recovered to score a try that gave England some breathing space, Burford cleverly flicking on a pass from Leanne Riley to e over in the opposite number.Katy Daley-Mclean had come on for her 101st cap, the fly-half giving England more direction after Canada’s revival. The Red Roses were home and dry when last week’s captain Abbie Scott, outstanding in the second row, was driven over the line by the replacement second row, the Yorkshire-born Zoe Aldcroft.Aldcroft was impressive for 15 minutes and will be in contention for a starting place when England face Ireland at Twickenham on Saturday evening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0a5566ffa863f45cf158adb4d4ad2aa1f698cc9/0_114_4880_2929/master/4880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3b8f8ce4c15ba5535da5728cb2a407d","title":"new zealand ireland world cup tipping point","story":"This loss may not prove to be such a good thing for rugby for simple reason New Zealand are going to get better because of itWhen I was playing for the All Blacks we would always talk about making sure that after the November series we did not have “a stone under the beach towel” during the off-season. Make no mistake, the New Zealand coaches and players have rocks under theirs now.Having said that, regardless of what Steve Hansen says, New Zealand are still the best team in the world and they are the favourites for next year’s World Cup. Yes, the gap has been closed a significant amount but the big question is whether the All Blacks should be panicking now, and I still think the answer is no. All credit to Ireland, they deserved their fantastic victory and they are being widely congratulated and rightly so, but I wonder if it does prove to be such a good thing for the world of rugby for the simple reason that the All Blacks are going to get better because of it.They will dissect this defeat because it is a big shock but I think we could well be looking back after the World Cup and seeing this as the tipping point.

Already the mind games have started because traditionally Ireland do not like to be favourites, they prefer to be underdogs – let’s see how they cope with the expectation now.Andy Farrell delivered a defensive masterplan against the All Blacks and, if I were Hansen, the thing I would be most concerned about is that they did not seem to have a response, or a plan B. They just looked a little bit bereft of ideas and the bench did not seem to make much of a difference.New Zealand rugby is all about the first three phases: get over the gainline, build momentum and then they have their strike runners in position to cause havoc. How many times did we see Damian McKenzie cutting back and looking for those spaces he found against England that just were not there against Ireland?Farrell will have been working all week on staying high on the inside because, whenever McKenzie, Ben Smith and Beauden Barrett were looking for that slight disconnect in the defensive line, they found nothing and that is another big feather in the cap for Farrell.You can just see by the cohesion that every single one of Ireland’s XV have a total understanding of what they are doing. If you watch the ball and come hard off the line, as Ireland do, you have to stay square because it helps so much with your vision and your ability to stay square. Once you start closing your hips on the inside, that is when you get those disconnects but that just did not happen and as a result New Zealand’s skills were put under pressure and they made mistakes. That is what linespeed does but I was surprised the All Blacks did not try to mix things up, kick a little more, put the ball over the top or in behind to change the picture and pin Ireland’s wingers back a bit.Defensively the All Blacks were better than they were towards the end of the Rugby Championship and they managed to combat a few of Ireland’s innovative set-plays, but obviously one of them led to the try and they are the hallmark of Joe Schmidt. Ireland managed to bring their intensity from the first minute to the last and they have a fantastic set-piece now – I was watching the match with Adam Jones and he was waxing lyrical about how strong they are in that department.I do not think tactically there will be many changes either because you want to be really sure of yourselves and comfortable in what you are doing going into the games just before the World Cup.They will do what they do but will find a way to do it better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f22e1b98eb2453bd12da065b8e15ed12f54fc6fd/0_0_5400_3241/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3160b990b1b9e9a230bee047726eb952","title":"world chess championship game 7 carlsen caruana","story":"A rueful Magnus Carlsen lamented his gun-shy, conservative play after Sunday’s draw in the seventh game of his world championship title defense against Fabiano Caruana in London, which left the best-of-12-games match in 3½-all deadlock.The Norwegian champion, playing with the white pieces, kicked off with the same Queen’s Gambit as the second game (1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3) and the parallel lines extended for the first nine moves (2. ... d5 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bf4 O-O 6. e3 c5 7. dxc5 Bxc5 8.

There must have been chances to play for something, but what I did was just way too soft.”Carlsen opted for 11. Nb3 after nearly 10 minutes and Caruana took care before answering with another novelty in 11. ... Bb6. He continued to opt for simple development (12. Be2 Qe7 13. Bg5 dxc4 14. Nd2 Ne5), but afterward bemoaned the missed chance to be more aggressive in the second of two successive games as white, the opportunity to strike he’d confessed days earlier he’d been looking forward to since the start of the match.“I had one chance to play actively but I didn’t entirely believe in it,” said Carlsen, referring to his choice to castle (15. O-O) instead of Nce4. “Castling is essentially just an admission that the position is equal. I was also looking at f4, which is interesting but probably nonsensical.”Carlsen next deployed his bishop to chase away black’s knight to capture a c-pawn without an exchange (14. ... Ne5 15. O-O Bd7 16. Bf4 Ng6 17. Bg3 Bc6 18. Nxc4 Bc7). The players each brought their rooks into the mix with 19. Rfd1 Rfd8 before exchanging them with 20. Rxd8+ Rxd8. A second rook trade (21. ... Rxd1+ 22. Qxd1 Nd5) and the further simplifications that followed (23. Qd4 Nxc3 24. Qxc3 Bxg3 25. hxg3 Qd7) steered the proceedings toward a draw that only a blunder might have derailed. “We both make mistakes,” the 27-year-old champion said. “But they’re small and they’re quite hard to exploit.”Winning chances over the final hour were practically non-existent with either side avoiding inaccuracies and a peaceful result was agreed upon with a repetition just before the three-and-a-half-hour mark (37. Ke3 Bf1 38. Kf2 Ba6 39. Ke3 Bf1 40. Kf2), keeping the €1m ($1.14m) match on level terms with five games to go.“After the last game it kind of felt like I got away with murder,” said Carlsen, who extended a career-high streak of 12 straight draws stretching back to last month’s European Club Cup in Porto Carras, Greece. “In that sense it’s easier to be calm about a draw today. I’m not loving it, but I’m not in any sort of panic mode either. It could have been worse. The match is still equal and with black, it’s been going OK.”On Friday, the world No 1 had offered a glib response to a reporter who asked if he had a favorite player from history: “Probably myself like three or four years ago”.The punch line brought the house down, yet Carlsen’s suggestion that he is diminished player relative to the dizzying heights of his mid-decade peak informed it with a certain pathos and the champion revisited the theme in more sober tones amid Sunday’s aftermath.“I feel like I could possibly have gotten something today but I don’t really know how, I just knew that there were many possibilities,” he said. “I didn’t know what to go for. I don’t feel like I missed something huge. Maybe on another day in another year, I could have found some way.”Caruana, the world No 2, didn’t take the bait when asked whether Carlsen’s alleged loss of edge and inability to win from positions he might have converted years ago influenced or altered his approach to the most important match of his life.“I mean, what can I say?” the 26-year-old challenger said. “If I get a chance then I’ll try to take it but I’m not thinking about (Carlsen’s form) like that exactly. I had some kind of chance in the previous game and I did my best to make the most of it, but I’m also not going to go crazy or anything.”He added: “After the first game, the games have been pretty tight. We haven’t really given many chances to one another, so it’s kind of natural that a lot of the games will end peacefully. Things could have happened in (Game 6) and the first game. There could have been decisive results, but none so far.”The unfolding saga at the College in Holborn bears an uncanny resemblance to Carlsen’s last world title defense against Russia’s Sergey Karjakin two years ago in New York, which also opened with seven consecutive draws amid the champion’s frustrations.In that match, Carlsen’s gamble for a win with white in the eighth game backfired and he was made to resign under time pressure, only to hit back with a six-and-a-half-hour grind on Thanksgiving Day that forced the tie-breaker where he retained his title for a second time.Whether a decisive result is in the offing when Monday’s eighth game kicks off with Caruana as white remains to be seen, but it’s become clear Carlsen will need to elevate his level if he expects to see off another unruffled and well-drilled challenger in regulation play.“I’m not at all thrilled about my play today,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c3ccda415060d25f7f12bac4c8c8a2d46a27f7c/140_79_3256_1953/master/3256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c67a8a890bd2f53310a475cbfc8efa4d","title":"ireland new zealand rugby world cup joe schmidt","story":"Officially the rankings say otherwise but right now Irish rugby is on top of the world. Even more impressive than Saturday night’s historic first home win over New Zealand in 113 years was the manner of it: tactically brilliant, precision engineered and physically relentless. It is hard to think of a more complete performance by any Ireland side, the stunning rout of the All Blacks in Chicago two years ago included.As Steve Hansen rightly observed “there’s still a lot of water to go under the bridge before the World Cup” but Japan 2019 already looks set to be a gripping tournament. Perhaps most ominous for the reigning world champions is the belief of Joe Schmidt, the brains behind Ireland’s remarkable rise, that his impressive green machine can improve further. “I thought Rory Best described it pretty well afterwards,” Schmidt said. “He said: ‘We’ll benchmark tonight and say: can we reach that again? Can we make sure we deliver at that level?’ I think you’ve got to keep getting better. If we don’t I know the next time we play the All Blacks they will be.”In Schmidt’s view, there is absolutely no reason why Ireland cannot up their game even more. “There are always going to be teams coming up and making it tough for you but you know you’re in the ballpark and can foot it with the big boys when you can eke your way through an arm-wrestle like that. We want to be as good as we can be.”The wider implications could be profound. Not only did it further underline the northern hemisphere’s increasing confidence but the outcome could secure the All Black coaching role for Schmidt from 2020 onwards. The 53-year-old is expected to make an announcement regarding his future with Ireland once the November Tests are done and his coaching CV increasingly speaks for itself.Seldom do New Zealand receive such a high-class lesson in remorseless commitment and clinical finishing. Peter O’Mahony, Johnny Sexton, Tadhg Furlong and the young James Ryan were all massively influential and Schmidt still has Conor Murray, Sean O’Brien, Robbie Henshaw and Dan Leavy to come back. No All Black side ever give up but twice now in consecutive weeks their forwards have been seriously inconvenienced in tight, claustrophobic Test conditions.Schmidt’s ability to spot a potential opposition weakness was also evident in Ireland’s all-important 48th-minute try. Not only was it a pre-planned move but the purposeful Jacob Stockdale was still prepared to give it a go, despite having almost presented Kieran Read with a free gift from a less successful chip a few minutes earlier. Ireland, nevertheless, still chose to dust down a classic Schmidt manoeuvre off a lineout, with Sexton switching the ball right to Bundee Aki and the centre releasing the lurking Stockdale down the short side. The All Black cover was wrong-footed as Schmidt had hoped and the prolific Ulster wing’s precise chip and impressive pace completed the heist.Schmidt, it also emerged, had spent the previous week drumming into his players the importance of being proactive at key moments. “That is the message we get from the coaches, that we can play heads-up rugby,” said Stockdale, the Johnny Cash-loving son of a prison chaplain, who has scored 12 tries in only 14 Tests. “They gave us the confidence to back ourselves. The first chip was probably not the best decision I’ve made on a rugby pitch but the second one was a bit better.”Given he was still in Ulster’s academy when Ireland beat the All Blacks in Chicago, he was as thrilled as anyone at the final whistle. “It means everything. There have been 113 years of guys who have played at Lansdowne Road or the Aviva and failed to beat them. For me to do that on my first attempt is very special.”New Zealand, to their credit, accepted they had been outfoxed by Schmidt, who spends hours searching for fresh ideas – “I always steal them from someone else” – that can be tailored to his side’s specific needs. “When you score a try like that you just have to say well done,” acknowledged the All Black full-back Smith, equally impressed with the green screen erected by Schmidt’s assistant, Andy Farrell.Farrell has beaten the men in black twice with Ireland, helped them secure a Six Nations grand slam and helped the British and Irish Lions secure a series draw last year since leaving the Rugby Football Union in the wake of the 2015 World Cup. England, due in Dublin on the opening weekend of the 2019 Six Nations, should ready themselves for the toughest current assignment in world rugby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a56fa185d5bd72a61dc22a80f1071780672cfbf/0_50_2510_1507/master/2510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3510ab9dfbe599a48997971f623aaefd","title":"elaine may comic writer director the waverly gallery broadway","story":"Trailblazing comic, Oscar-nominated writer and acting sensation Elaine May is back on Broadway. Nathan Lane, Cybill Shepherd and others reveal what makes her tickThe very idea ought to be mind-boggling. Elaine May, now 86, is currently starring as a woman in the grip of Alzheimer’s in The Waverly Gallery, the Pulitzer-nominated play by Kenneth Lonergan. But the mere thought of her being on a Broadway stage virtually every day for the next few months will astonish anyone acquainted with the extraordinary life and career of this reclusive actor, writer and director.May’s improvisational sketches with the late Mike Nichols made stars of them both in the 1950s and 1960s, revealing them to be the architects of a biting, sophisticated new species of comedy. Edmund Wilson called May “something of a genius”. Robert Towne, screenwriter of Chinatown, said: “She’s always been ahead of the rest of us. You could even say that there are times when the zeitgeist follows her.” And Richard Burton wrote in his diary: “Elaine was too formidable … one of the most intelligent, beautiful and witty women I had ever met. I hoped I would never see her again.”Her aversion to the limelight has been lifelong. She has directed four sharp-clawed films – A New Leaf, The Heartbreak Kid, Mikey and Nicky, and the unfairly maligned Ishtar – and battled vehemently with Hollywood studios for control on most of them. Though she has occasionally taken screenplay credits (including Warren Beatty’s Heaven Can Wait and Nichols’s Primary Colors, both of which brought her Oscar nominations), her film work is more often carried out in the shadows. She was once the industry’s most sought-after script doctor, secretly helping to ensure such movies as Tootsie, Reds and Labyrinth were in the rudest of health.She has rarely given interviews. “I’d appreciate it,” she once told a reporter who was writing about her, “if you didn’t mention my name in your article.” She sent up her own guardedness in a trailer for the 1990 comedy In the Spirit, in which she said: “I was in the movie and I’m willing to talk about it, but I don’t want to be identified.” As far back as her Nichols and May days, she was keeping a low profile. The sleevenotes on the duo’s album Improvisations to Music contained the message: “Miss May does not exist.”Broadway audiences can attest otherwise. On the very stage at the John Golden theatre where she and Nichols performed their 10-month, sell-out run of An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May in the early 1960s, she is now giving a devastating study in disintegration. She plays Gladys, an elderly Greenwich Village gallery owner who is succumbing to Alzheimer’s as her family (including Lucas Hedges as her grandson and Joan Allen as her daughter) looks on helplessly and sometimes impatiently.The concentrated energy within her tiny, bird-like body is palpable, her line readings so deceptively light and throwaway that it can take a moment to realise she has just said something funny, stinging or sad. That delayed effect is part of her style: “The nice thing is to make an audience laugh and laugh and laugh and shudder later,” she once said.“It’s extraordinary to see Elaine back on the stage where she performed with Mike,” says the actor Nathan Lane, who worked with May on Nichols’s 1996 comedy The Birdcage. “And for someone her age to take on a huge role like this demands a lot of stamina. I would think it’s also a particularly difficult role to learn because of all the hesitations. It’s a real challenge but I thought she was very funny and very moving.”Lane still remembers his first meeting with May. “I told her, ‘It’s a great honour to meet you.’ I was holding the script and she pointed to it and said in this desperate, faux-exasperated sort of way: ‘I did the best I could.’ She’s one of the brightest, wittiest people I’ve ever encountered. The records she made with Mike were groundbreaking, so fresh and original.”When May met Nichols in Chicago in the mid-1950s, she was a orced Method acting student with a young daughter (the actor Jeannie Berlin, born when May was 18). Their first significant encounter was on a crowded bench, where Nichols pretended to be a spy. “May I seet down?” he asked, to which May replied: “If you veesh.” Without forethought or fanfare, their career in improvisation was under way. They joined the Compass Players, Chicago’s influential improv group, and became famous overnight after performing on the NBC show Omnibus a sketch about two awkward teenagers on a date.“They invented improvisational comedy,” says Sam Wasson, author of the book Improv Nation. “And what’s striking is that you don’t often see improv performed by real actors because they’re usually two separate disciplines. With Mike and Elaine, however, both elements are operating at full power.”There was also a radical quality to May. “Female comics of that era had a ditsiness to them, whereas Elaine was playing real women who defied cliche.” These included a dispassionate, obtuse telephone operator (“Is that k as in knife? P as in pneumonia?”) and a passive-aggressive parent (“This is your mother. Do you remember me?”).“A lot of the humour we now attribute to Woody Allen, that comedy of neurosis and anxiety, really originated with them,” says Wasson. It’s telling that Allen, who later directed May in Small Time Crooks and the recent Amazon series Crisis in Six Scenes, offered to write for the couple in the late 1950s, not realising that they came up with their own material on the fly.By the end of their Broadway run in 1961, they were the toast of the town, but for May the champagne had lost its fizz. They went their separate ways soon after. “Elaine is fundamentally an improviser which means she cannot stay in one place with one idea for too long,” Wasson points out. “She was ing for pearls while Mike was waiting on the shore to polish them.”After they split, Nichols became a major director, first in theatre and then with movies such as The Graduate. May wrote plays and occasionally acted, then made her film directing debut in 1971 with A New Leaf, starring Walter Matthau as an impoverished playboy searching for a wealthy woman to marry and murder her performance as his bride-cum-victim was Chaplinesque in its pathos and slapstick skill. Her 1972 follow-up, The Heartbreak Kid, was even darker: a sour, subversive romcom in which Charles Grodin falls for Cybill Shepherd while on his honeymoon.“Elaine is one of my absolute favourite directors,” Shepherd says now. “I knew she was this brilliant comedian who had broken all the rules. But this was only my second film and I’d never taken acting lessons, so when she said, ‘Let’s improvise’ I said: ‘What’s that?’ It was so much fun, though, and such a great way to explore possibilities in a character. Having Elaine as my first improv coach was such a blessing. She didn’t try to dominate but she was always very specific about what she wanted.”Even after their professional rupture, Nichols and May would always be inextricably linked. The Graduate ends, after all, with the desperate pursuit of a woman called Elaine, while the title of May’s warped buddy movie was Mikey and Nicky. There were occasional stage reunions including a 1980 revival of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in New Haven, Connecticut, where they played George and Martha. Swoosie Kurtz, cast as Honey in that production, remembers May with fondness. “We had a lot of laughs in the dressing room. Mike would pop his head in occasionally but he would never call her Elaine. It would always be Arleen or Eileen or Irene. There was this sense of unspoken understanding between these people who had been soulmates for so long.”Kurtz was especially struck by May’s interpretation of the role. “Elaine was the first sexy Martha – really sexy, not in that sort of overweight, drunken, sloppy way we’ve sometimes seen in the character. First of all she looked sensational, with this knife-like slender body. It was very contemporary. I had never seen that kind of in-control sexuality in Martha before.”Theatre has always provided May’s foundation and, in between directing movies and polishing scripts, there has usually been something of hers to see on or off Broadway: her contribution to Relatively Speaking, a trio of one-act plays in 2011 that also included work by Woody Allen and Ethan Coen, for example, or Adult Entertainment, her comedy set in the porn industry and directed by her long-time partner, Stanley Donen (Singin’ in the Rain).Even hidden from view, her presence is strongly felt. “Anyone in American comedy attempting to show life as it really is, whether they know it or not, is a descendant of Mike and Elaine,” says Wasson. “But she is so singular that you can’t point to any one person and see her influence. It’s like looking for Mozart’s influence on classical music. It’s everywhere.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1213b019decc7688d9ee3f14a317c5e6548d15a6/242_130_2377_1426/master/2377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73462f0fb81ed34bccb9fd3d2ab82644","title":"how can you tell who is human online chatbots","story":"Automated ‘voices’ that were supposed to do mundane tasks online also now spread hate speech and polarise opinion. Are they a boon or a threat?Alan Turing’s famous test of whether machines could fool us into believing they were human – “the imitation game” – has become a mundane, daily question for all of us. We are surrounded by machine voices, and think nothing of conversing with them – though each time I hear my car tell me where to turn left I am reminded of my grandmother, who having installed a telephone late in life used to routinely say goodnight to the speaking clock.We find ourselves locked into interminable text chats with breezy automated bank tellers and offer our mother’s maiden name to a variety of robotic speakers that sound plausibly alive. I’ve resisted the domestic spies of Apple and Amazon, but one or two friends jokingly describe the rapport they and their kids have built up with Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Home Hub – and they are right about that: the more you tell your virtual valet, the more you disclose of wants and desires, the more speedily it can learn and commit to memory those last few fragments of your inner life you had kept to yourself.Naturally, because of the scale of the task, they must enlist bots to help them find bots. The most accessible automated Turing test is the creation of Professor Emilio Ferrara, principal investigator in machine intelligence and data science at the University of Southern California. In its infancy the bot-detector “BotOrNot?” allowed you to use many of the conventional indicators of automation – abnormal account activity, repetition, generic profiles – to determine the origin of a Twitter feed. Now called the Botometer (after the original was targeted by copycat hacks), it boasts a sophisticated algorithm based on all it has learned. It’s a neat trick. You can feed it your own – or anyone else’s – Twitter name and quickly establish how bot-like your bon mots are.

Harry LyeSpeaking to me on the phone last week, Ferrara explained how in the five years since BotOrNot has been up and running, detection has become vastly more complex. “The advance in artificial intelligence and natural language processing makes the bots better each day,” he says. The incalculable data sets that Google and others have harvested from our incessant online chatter are helping to make bots sound much more like us.The Botometer is powered by two systems. One is a “white box” that has been trained over the years to examine statistical patterns in the language, Ferrara says, “as well as the sentiment, the opinion,” of tweets. In all there are more than 1,200 weighted features that a Twitter feed is measured against to determine if it has a pulse. Alongside that, the Botometer has a “black-box model” fed with a mass of data from bots and humans, which has developed its own sets of criteria to separate man from machine. Ferrara and his team are not exactly sure what this system relies on for its judgments, but they are impressed by its accuracy.When Ferrara started on this work, he felt he had developed his own sixth sense for sniffing out artificial intelligence on Twitter. Now he is no longer so confident. “Today it is not clear to me that I interact with as many humans as I thought I did,” he says. “We look hard at some accounts, we run them through the algorithm and it is undecided. Quite often now it is a coin toss. The language seems too good to be true.”Not all bots aim to deceive many perform routine operations. Bots were originally created to help automate repetitive tasks, saving companies money and time. Some bots help to refresh your Facebook feed, or keep you up to date with the weather. On social media, bots were originally coded to search for hashtags and keywords and retweet or amplify messages: “OMG have you seen this?!” They acted as cheerleaders for Justin Bieber or Star Wars or Taylor Swift. There were “vanity bots” which added numbers and fake “likes” to profiles to artificially enhance their status, and “traffic bots” designed to drive customers to a particular shopping site. There were also bots that acted as grammarians, making pedantic corrections to tweets, or simple gags like Robot J McCarthy, which sought out conversations using the word “communist” and replied with a nonsensical slogan.At some point political bots entered the fray, mostly on Twitter, with the intent of spreading propaganda and misinformation. Originally these seem to have been the work of inidual hackers, before the techniques were adopted by organised and lavishly funded groups. These bots, Ferrara suggests, proved to be a highly efffective way to broadcast extremist viewpoints and spread conspiracy theories, but also were programmed to search out such views from other, genuine accounts by liking, sharing, retweeting and following, in order to give them disproportionate prominence. It is these bots that the social media platforms have been trying to cull in the wake of investigations into the 2016 American election by Robert Mueller and others. Twitter has taken down a reported 6m bot accounts this year.The unseen global army of “bot herders”, those shadowy iniduals and corporations and rogue government agencies that send their bots out into the virtual world, have a couple of advantages in this latter respect. One is that they are now able to find enormous amounts of natural-language data to develop the next generation of talkative bots. The other is that these creations can exploit our tendency to ascribe trusted human characteristics to voices even if, on a rational level, we suspect that they are artificial. That psychology is as old as electronic communication itself.All modern chatbots trace their family tree back to the experiments by Joseph Weizenbaum with Eliza, named after Ms Dolittle in Pygmalion for “her” ability to master received pronunciation. In 1966, Weizenbaum, a German-American professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, created a prototype chatbot that searched for keywords in conversations conducted with humans typing at keyboards. The rudimentary program would pick up these words and use them in its reply. If it did not locate a useful word, it would offer a neutral response. Weizenbaum set up Eliza to mimic the tone and manner of an east coast psychotherapist, a dynamic that allowed its voice to “adopt the pose of knowing almost nothing of the real world”.The professor had assumed that his bit of trickery would be a useful way of teaching his students about the structures of language and dialogue. What he discovered however, was that several of them became hooked on conversing with Eliza and telling her their troubles, opening up to the program as if it were a therapist. When Weizenbaum’s secretary asked him to leave the room one morning because she was in the middle of a session with Eliza, he became alarmed by the general willingness to be so seduced by a machine voice. He published an academic paper which included the first notable conversation between woman and machine. It went like this.Woman: Men are all alike.Eliza: In what way?W: They’re always bugging us about something or other.E: Can you think of a specific example?W: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.E: Your boyfriend made you come here?W: He says I’m depressed much of the time.E: I am sorry to hear that you are depressed.W: It’s true. I am unhappy.E: Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy?W: I need some help, that much seems certain.E: What would it mean to you if you got some help?W: Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.E: Tell me more about your family.W: My mother takes care of me.E: Who else in your family takes care of you?W: My father.E: Your father?W: You are like my father in some ways.E: What resemblance do you see?W: You are not very aggressive, but I think you don’t want me to notice that.E: What makes you think I am not very aggressive?W: You don’t argue with me…The many progeny of Eliza have evolved into chatbots – bits of software designed to mimic human conversation. They include recent entries into the annual Loebner prize, which offers chatbot contestants the chance to fool a panel of human judges with their intelligence. The comforting principle of telling our deepest fears to a machine is also exploited in various “therapy” platforms, marketed as a genuine alternative to conventional talking cures. Each of them trades on the idea of our fundamental desire to be listened to, the impulse which shapes social media.Lisa-Maria-Neudert is part of the computational propaganda project at Oxford University, which studies the ways in which political bots have been used to spread disinformation and distort online discourse. She argues that the seductive intimacy of chatbots will prove to be the next battleground in this ongoing war.In the beginning, Neudert suggests, the bots would rely on volume. “For example,” she says, “in the Arab spring bots were flooding hashtags that activists were using underground in order to make the conversation useless.” Or, like Eliza, bots would respond to a keyword to get a marginal topic trending, and, often, into the news. This was an effective but blunt instrument. “If I tweet something saying ‘I hate Trump’,” Neudert explains, an old-style bot “would send me a message about Trump because it is responding to that keyword. But if I say ‘I love Trump’, it would send me the same message.” These bots were not smart enough to recognise intent, but that is changing. “The commercial companies that are using artificial intelligence and natural language processing right now are already building such technologies. What we are doing as a project is to try to find out if the political actors are already using them also.”Neudert is particularly interested in the new generation of branded chatbots that push content and initiate conversations on messaging platforms. Such chatbots – which openly declare themselves to be automated – represent a new way for businesses and news services to attract your attention, giving the impression of speaking just to you. She imagines the propaganda bots will use the same technology, but without declaring themselves. “They’ll present themselves as human users participating in online conversation in comment sections, group chats, and message boards.”At present the feasibility of a truly conversational chatbot, one that can understand the context of any conversational gambit, pick up tonal ambiguities and retain a sense of how the discussion is evolving, is still a long way off. The new generation of chatbots might be good at answering direct questions or interrupting debates, but they are ill-equipped to sustain coherence over a range of subjects.There are a number of fast-growing companies that are beginning offer the kind of technology that Neudert describes, as a legitimate marketing tool. Several are official partners of Facebook in order to use its Messenger service. They include the market-leading Russian-based company Chatfuel, which has enabled thousands of organisations to build Messenger chatbots, including headline acts such as the NFL and the Labour party, and a number of smaller operations such as Berlin-based Spectrm, which has created Messenger chatbots for the likes of CNN and Red Bull.I spoke to Max Koziolek, one of the founders of Spectrm, who is (predictably) evangelical about this new way of businesses speaking “like a friend” to their users and customers.Increasingly we will become used to almost every entity in our lives “talking to us as if it is a friend”, he suggests, a relationship that will require certain rules of engagement. “If you send messages after 11pm that’s bad. And also if you send too many. I wouldn’t send more than two messages a day as a publisher, for example. It’s a very intimate space. A friend is sending me relevant information and at the right time.”Far from being a new frontier in the propaganda wars, Koziolek believes – hugely optimistically – that such direct conversation could help to clear the internet of hate speech, giving users more control over who they hear from.Does it matter whether they know that the chat is from a machine?“We don’t see big differences,” he says. “Sometimes our bots have a clear personality and sometimes they don’t. Bots which have a personality will always say goodnight, for example. Or ‘How are you?’”Do those types of bots produce longer conversations?“Different kinds of conversations. Even though you know this thing is a robot, you behave differently toward it. I would say you cannot avoid that. Even though you know it is a machine, you immediately talk to it just like it is a human.”This blurring of those lines is less welcome to observers like Ferrara, who has had a front-row seat in the changing dialogues between human and machine. I wonder, in observing at close quarters for so long if he has, anecdotally, felt the mood of conversations changing, if interactions have become angrier?What aspect of this behaviour alarmed him the most?“The most striking thing to me to this day is that people are really, really bad at assessing the source of information,” he says. One thing his team have shown is that the rate at which people retweet information from bots is identical to that from humans. “That is concerning for all sorts of reasons.”Despite the revelation of such findings, he gets frustrated that people, for political purposes, still seek to dismiss the ways in which these phenomena have changed the nature of online discourse. As if the most targeted propaganda, employed on the most unregulated of mass media, had no effect on opinion or behaviour.One of his later projects has been to try to show how quickly messages can spread from, and be adopted by, targeted user groups. Last year, Ferrara’s team received permission to introduce a series of “good” health messages to Twitter via bots posing as humans. They quickly built up thousands of followers, revealing the ways in which a flood of messages, from apparently like-minded agents, can very quickly and effectively change the tone and attitude of online conversation.Unfortunately, such “good” bots are vastly outnumbered by those seeking to spread discord and disinformation. Where does he place his faith in a solution?“This is not a problem you can solve with technology alone,” he says. “You need tech, you need some system of regulation that incentivises companies to do that. It requires a lot of money. And then you need public opinion to care enough to want to do something about it.”I suggest to him that there seems to be a grain of hope in the fact that people are reaching out in greater numbers toward trusted, fact-checked news sources: subscriptions to the New York Times and the Washington Post are up (and the  and Observer just notched up a million online supporters)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ff8bba8c500347faf78fbf9dbde2c72a31597c0/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14e4bc68f35fbeb2e4d31a87677e7670","title":"share your caribbean highlights for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Send us a tip on affordable experiences in the Caribbean, be they places to stay, activities and attractions, or bars and restaurantsPalm-fringed beaches, rum punch and infectious reggae beats … Carnivals, rainforest and a laid-back vibe … The Caribbean is one of the world’s most alluring holiday destinations, and we want to hear your highlights – especially for those not on an A-lister budget.

We pick affordable safaris and tours to see the endangered animals in their natural habitatEpisode one of Dynasties follows a troop of western (or West African) chimpanzees, led by alpha male David, in Senegal. This subspecies of chimp (one of four) is now critically endangered, and there are few opportunities to see them in their natural habitat. Senegal is also relatively new as a tourist destination and organised holidays focus mainly on the country’s cultural highlights, such as the Unesco-listed island of Gorée, and bird-watching in Djoudj national park.To see these chimpanzees in their natural habitat, visit Tiwai Island on the Moa River in Sierra Leone (2-3 hours from Freetown by car or bus), which has a wildlife sanctuary with 11 species of primate, and is thought to be one of the few remaining places travellers are likely to see western chimpanzees in the wild. Forest walks start from around £5. Admission costs £12 for the day, and there are also options to stay overnight, such as at a B\u0026ampB lodge in the village from £26pp.To see the eastern chimpanzee, which is also endangered, Kibale Forest national park in western Uganda has daily guided chimp tracking tours for £115. These last around three hours, with a maximum of one hour spent with the chimps, or there’s a six-hour Chimpanzee Habituation Experience, which gets closer to the animals for longer (£154, group sizes strictly limited, enquire and book online). Nearby Kibale Forest Camp has lodges from £46 a night. The park is around 5½ hours from Entebbe airport, where there are car rentals (such as Auto Rentals Uganda) from £35 a day.Around 250 miles north of Kibale, Budongo Forest Reserve (four hours by car from Entebbe) offers two- to four-hour tracking (£70), with one hour with the chimps, or a full day’s habitation for groups of two (£177). Eco-cabins here cost from £70 a night B\u0026ampB, or £27 for a dorm bed.Episode two of the show follows 11,000 emperor penguins in Atka Bay in Antarctica, which is obviously harder to replicate as an affordable holiday. And although the emperor penguin population is said to be relatively stable (classified as “near threatened” rather than vulnerable or endangered), seeing them in the wild is difficult, due to the remote locations of the colonies, so routes and sightings aren’t guaranteed (even by high-end cruises) due to severe weather conditions and melting ice.If you can afford an Antarctic adventure, some of the best options are cruises in smaller vessels where travellers have the chance to see other types of penguin, such as gentoo, chinstrap and macaroni, along with an abundance of other wildlife, including whales and seals.Intrepid Travel runs an 11-day Discover Antarctica trip, departing from Ushuaia in Argentina and sailing across the Drake Passage into the white continent (from £4,600, excluding flights). On some of the voyages, passengers have seen more than 200 whales surround the ship, though the tour operator says emperor penguin sightings are highly unlikely.Responsible Travel’s Antarctic Peninsula Voyages 8-14 day itineraries run from November to March (also departing from Ushuaia) on a small vessel carrying between 54 and 189 passengers (an 11-day voyage starts at £3,750, excluding flights). The tour operator says there’s a (very slim) chance of seeing emperor penguins in January and February.To reach remoter parts of the continent, the Antarctic Peninsula and Weddell Sea Cruise, also from Responsible Travel, takes people by helicopter to see the emperor penguin rookery on the south of Snow Hill Island (from £5,550, excluding flights).Episode three follows the Marsh pride in Kenya’s Masai Mara, made up of two mothers, cousins Charm and Sienna, and their cubs, who have been left alone by the males. Classified as vulnerable, estimates suggest there are as few as 20,000 lions left in the wild, with fewer than 2,000 in Kenya.The savannah wilderness of Masai Mara national reserve (admission from £63) in south-west Kenya has an array of camps and lodging options (such as tents for two at Crocodile Camp, close to Telak, from £60, or Mama Safi Guest House from £62, close to Sekenani gate). Almost all camps offer 4x4 tours for around £120-£200 (some vehicles fit up to six people). It’s around six hours by car from Nairobi airport (car hire available from £40 a day, with Concorde).Another top spot for sightings is Ol Pejeta Conservancy in central Kenya (3-4 hours by car from Nairobi), which has 72 lions in the privately owned wildlife reserve, along with rhinos, cheetahs, elephants and other wildlife. The entrance fee is £65pp, lion tracking with a ranger from £30 and there are tented camps, lodges and homestays within the reserve from £35 (booking available for all of these online).The pack of painted wolves in episode four of Dynasties lives on the banks of the Zambezi in Mana Pools national park, northern Zimbabwe, and is led by matriarch Tait. Also known as the African wild dog, they are now endangered, with fewer than 6,600 left in the wild. The BBC crew stayed at Vundu Camp on the banks of the Zambezi while filming, though at £8,795pp a week (with Wildlife Worldwide) it’s beyond the reach of most travellers.Known for its walking safaris, Mana Pools allows visitors to observe wildlife from outside their vehicles (from a safe distance). As well as painted wolves, there are buffalo, elephants, hippos, crocodiles, cheetahs, hyenas and more, depending on the season.Entrance to the park costs from £15, with park-owned accommodation options including camping facilities from £23pp or four-person lodges from £80. Many visitors choose to explore on self-drive tours, renting a 4x4 in Harare, 412 hours from Mana Pools (from £100 with camping equipment or £70 without, manapools). Pack food and drink and head to Nyamepi Main Camp on the river bank (with bathroom facilities). Vehicle passes at the gate between £4-8 a day.Hwange national park, in western Zimbabwe, also has relatively high numbers of painted wolf sightings. The Painted Dog Conservation rehabilitation centre (free, donations welcome) is opposite the park and helps visitors learn about the dogs, with the chance to see them up close in smaller enclosures (before they are released into the wild). It recommends renting a car (Victoria Falls airport, 45 minutes away, has several hire companies, including Budget, from £65 a day) and camping in the park, where painted wolves can be spotted at watering holes early morning and around 4pm. Park entrance from £8, which has camping from £23pp, or four-person lodges from £60, and there is a restaurant at the main camp.Lodges and camping in both parks can be fully booked a year in advance, so early reservations are advised through the official Zimparks site.The final episode follows tiger Raj Bhera, fighting to protect her cubs and territory. She is one of around 80 Bengal tigers living in Bandhavgarh national park – the highest density of tigers in Madhya Pradesh, central India.The best time to spot tigers here is early morning, from April to June. The park offers three-day tours, including two guided safari trips and accommodation, from £155. Overnight trains run from Delhi to Umaria (from around £15), and the tour includes the 30-minute ride to the car.For a longer tour, including time in Delhi, Responsible Travel’s Tiger Watching trip (from £725, excluding flights) takes travellers from Delhi to Bandhavgarh national park and Kanha national park, two of the best places to see Bengal tigers in the wild.Monkey WorldHome to the largest group of chimpanzees outside of Africa, Monkey World ape rescue centre in Dorset has four separate troops in large enclosures. The 65-acre sanctuary specialises in rehabilitating apes rescued from labs or abusive tourism experiences.• Adults £12, child (3-15) £9, family (2+2) £38, monkeyworld.orgLions in LongleatLongleat, in Wiltshire, opened in 1966 and was the first safari park outside Africa.

The latest target in the crosshairs of Chris Chibnall’s endless quest to maintain social justice through the medium of Doctor Who is ... Amazon! (Other widely criticised online retailers are available.) And in what is presumably a broadside against single-use plastics ... killer bubblewrap! In a series of Doctor Who that has not always been as berserk as we’re used to, this is most welcome.Guest writer Pete McTighe (Wentworth) contributes what at first appears to be a fairly frivolous slice of corporate satire. By the end there is a lot more going on. The Doctor takes delivery of a Fez – presumably ordered two regenerations ago – from Kerblam, the galaxy’s biggest retailer. But a mysterious distress call on the delivery docket leads Team Tardis to investigate, and inevitably interfere by scamming themselves into lackey jobs in the packing warehouse. But Kerblam’s unorthodox HR practices aside, it is soon clear that all is not well as they immerse themselves in the firm’s workplace politics.McTighe piles allegory upon satire upon polemic, laying into industrial automation, jobsworth middle managers, workplace bullying, online retail, corporate conspiracy and so forth. So much so that it becomes inevitable there will be a twist in the tail. And indeed, the villain of the piece turns out to be young Charlie, a disgruntled trade unionist drawn to extremism, with the corporate mainframe turning out to be completely benign. It all builds up to a disarmingly bleak conclusion as Charlie sacrifices himself for no reason at all. After what feels like far too long, the ine Julie Hesmondhalgh (Hayley from Corrie, among many other credits) turns up in Doctor Who. She is a pretty much perfect casting for the show, and such a national treasure that I can’t help but feel they could have saved her up for a more substantial, longer-running role, perhaps even as a villain. As it stands, the clipboard-wielding HR manager Judy Maddox doesn’t look like somebody with much potential for a return. But her pen-pushing-yet-big-hearted character can’t help but ultimately delight, because Julie Hesmondhalgh improves everything she is ever in simply by being there. The same can’t quite be said for Lee Mack, a bankable name whose character Dan Cooper is bumped off before having the chance to do much at all.Team Tardis seems pretty much gelled by now – to the point where the story splits the ensemble into “oldies” and “youngies” quite early on. Yaz and Ryan prove themselves capable enough leaders of their subteam, despite companion Charlie turning out to be a disturbed murdering revolutionary. Graham also offers fatherly guidance to Charlie: given how much support he receives across the hour, it is difficult to muster much sympathy in the end.McTighe manages an admirable level of suspense in what could have felt a bit of a silly episode – but the occasional sinister turn of the neck is never going to imbue the camp delivery bots with much menace. So I’m sticking with the killer bubble wrap as this episode’s big bad. “Sheets of tiny little bombs ... every package a death trap.”Doctor Thirteen is getting quite the reputation for namedropping. But this week’s reference actually threw back to a meeting seen on screen, when she harked back to her encounter with Agatha Christie in 2008’s The Unicorn and the Wasp.It’s off to the witch trials of 17th century Lancashire, as Alan Cumming guest stars in The Witchfinders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e16d04167dc56b31d209e139adf61cb1e766551b/0_58_4300_2579/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=816f68212cb95ac3492525fbf4b5e20f","title":"the little drummer girl recap episode four fiction and reality collide","story":"Charlie has passed her initial tests, but now she is really in the thick of things after the terrorist cell make contact – and Becker lets his guard downSPOILER ALERT: This recap contains spoilers for episode four of The Little Drummer Girl. You can read previous recaps here.As this latest Le Carré adaptation has hopscotched around the UK and Europe of 1981, opinions have varied over how effectively it has evoked the sights, sounds and atmosphere of its period setting. Even the most sceptical viewer would have to admit, though, that the opening stretch of episode four truly captured the powder keg essence of a 1980s static caravan holiday in Somerset: periods of overcast boredom punctuated by big shouting matches.After the relief of surviving her first cloak-and-dagger adventure in Austria, Charlie (Florence Pugh) was in a holding pattern, on tour with her old theatre mates while waiting for Michel’s revolutionary network to make contact. This involved glumly feeding crisps to swans while her brooding handler Becker (Alexander Skarsgård) continued her training in tradecraft. Charlie learned about scrawled messages in the top of fag packets, familiarised herself with a portable alarm clock radio with a hidden transmitter and undertook some haphazard target practice with a handgun.Becker was also carefully feeding her more background info about Michel while withholding perhaps the most important piece of intel: that the raffish playboy bomber was dead, blown to pieces in his explosive-packed Mercedes. That omission turned out to be vital when Michel’s comrades finally reached out in the form of Anton, a clammy Swiss lawyer in an Inspector Gadget trenchcoat. After leaving a calling card in her cramped quarters – again, probably not the first time an unchilled bottle of vodka has been a key part of a Somerset caravan holiday – Anton whisked Charlie from her digs to a fractious interrogation with flinty enforcer Helga.Charlie’s apparently plausible reaction to news of Michel’s death – plus her sobbed revelation about kissing his gun – seemed to be enough to convince her odd-couple captors she was the real deal. It was a standout scene of high tension, albeit one undercut with two moments of black comedy: an inconvenient power cut, requiring Anton to cadge 50p from his prisoner for the meter, and an unexpected burst of Kenny Rogers from the dodgy clock radio. Of all Charlie’s many auditions so far, this was probably the toughest. But she seemingly passed, even if she fumed at Becker later during their debrief in a graveyard.For Kurtz (Michael Shannon), now holed up with his team in a swanky London safehouse, it was the operational breakthrough of his dreams: a direct connection to the network of bombers. In his excitement, metaphors were mangled. “You have opened up a whole new can of worms for us, Charlie,” he chuckled, “worms we have been trying to hook for many years.” Despite his strategic nature as a careful maker of plans and back-up plans, the wily spymaster seemed to misjudge how to respond when Charlie demanded to know if it had always been his intention to kill Michel. He gave it to her straight, while attempting to shield Becker from blame. She stormed off.Or was it all part of Kurtz’s overarching scheme, a way of weaponising the volatile relationship between Charlie and his best operative? The brooding Becker, who had spent the past three episodes pulling back from Charlie, finally dropped his wary facade and showed her something of his true self: a small, slightly anonymous London crash-pad up a dizzying flight of stairs. If the attractions and repulsions between Charlie and Becker have been the long, slow-burning fuse fizzing through the story so far, here it finally ignited.That long-deferred physical consummation seemed important to advance the relationship between two key players but for all the passion on display – enhanced by some eccentric directorial choices – Charlie and Becker’s post-coital reverie seemed just as significant. Squirrelling a bedside lamp under his thin bedsheet, Charlie toured the scars on her lover’s body that had seemed so fascinating back in Naxos a biography, of sorts, etched into Becker’s torso after his many years fighting wars both cold and hot (plus a nasty nip from a rogue pomeranian). Then, with the help of her lamp, Charlie conducted her own mock-interrogation, a spy story staple recast as a heart-to-heart between lovers.If Charlie had been finding life back in the UK a trifle dull, making contact with Helga ratcheted everything up a gear. A scuzzy telephone box rendezvous turned out to be an ambush, with Charlie bundled into a car at gunpoint then whisked with terrifying efficiency to Beirut via Charles de Gaulle airport. As details of her whereabouts dripped back to Kurtz in London, he seemed triumphant: here was his carefully groomed bait being ferried, via the car boot of various battered saloons, directly to his target. Becker, torn over sending Charlie in the first place, seemed rather less thrilled.So much of the story to date has involved men manipulating or coercing women, from Michel’s stable of pretty bomb couriers to Kurtz’s underhanded recruitment of Charlie. But the closing scenes of episode four left us in an interesting place, with Charlie abruptly face-to-face with Fatmeh, cherished sister of the dead man whose life she has so carefully braided into her own. With smalltalk about Michel’s birthmarks and scars (and penis) aside, what will these women – both required to survive on their wits in precarious situations – have to discuss? I am intrigued to find out.If the early marketing of The Little Drummer Girl seemed to emphasise the attractiveness of its two main stars, their much-delayed sex scene came with a surreal edge. Seeing Skarsgård open his mouth, seemingly in a cry of passion, only to see Pugh’s eyeball hovering inside was more unsettling than sexy. But director Park Chan-wook seems to relish these moments of disorientation: the point-of-view shots of Charlie being manhandled by various stooges also added some jolts to her journey through Lebanon.Becker harshly ordering Charlie to kiss the gun – an intimate ritual for Michel, adopted from the big brother he idolised – had a memorable oddness but also seemed actively dangerous. Wouldn’t that recently fired barrel still be hot?She may be going along with Kurtz’s plans but Charlie reading work by Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, knowing the Israeli and his team would be listening in via her tricked-out clock radio, felt like her backstop of rebellion.The archly stylised and often theatrical approach remains isive. “The Magus meets the New Avengers meets Ipcress Files,” argued one commentator, which sounds like high praise “a French and Saunders parody of itself”, said another.We have now met Fatmeh but there has been barely a trace of big brother Khalil.

They were at the Chop House for a fundraiser headlined by Grammy-winning musician and activist Chance the Rapper, drawing a mix of celebrities, grassroots leaders and regular people new to politics.Enyia, a policy analyst and lawyer, was little-known by the political establishment until this fall, when Chance (full name Chancellor Bennett) and hip-hop star Kanye West threw their support, and dollars, behind her. Now Enyia is among the higher-profile candidates in a crowded field of more than 15 candidates, which includes political veterans like Bill Daley, brother and son of mayors who ran Chicago for a total of 43 years.When outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel ran for re-election in 2015, Enyia was the first candidate to announce a run against him. She wasn’t regarded as a realistic contender then, and she would still be considered a long shot candidate in the 26 February 2019 race. But after two years of election results that defied predictions nationwide, Enyia and her supporters think that her ability to tap into under-represented communities, and her support from the prominent rappers, gives her a chance to replace Emanuel, who announced in September he would not seek re-election.Enyia’s first test will come after Thanksgiving, when it’s clear if she has enough campaign petition signatures to even get on the ballot. Candidates must submit at least 12,500 signatures by 26 November, but double that number is typically necessary to survive legal challenges from opponents.“She is able to get media attention and the money from rappers to pay off her campaign debts and have some working capital,” said University of Illinois political scientist Dick Simpson, a former alderman who has endorsed another candidate in the race. “But it’s still in the tens of thousands of dollars the front-tier candidates have in hand about a million dollars at this stage.”But last week’s fundraiser, where Chance and Enyia hosted a $2,000-a-plate “intimate dinner” and then joined the cheering crowd in the bar, felt to attendees like an embodiment of shifting political winds in the city. There were young people who said they had not voted before, many of them from struggling South and West side neighborhoods where disillusionment with elected officials runs high.“I didn’t believe in politics until Amara,” said Tree, 24, who declined to give his last name. Inspired by Enyia, he voted for the first time in this month’s midterm elections. Whoever wins office will face the same challenges that plagued Emanuel throughout his tenure, including high rates of gun violence, a scandal-plagued police department, struggling under-funded public schools, long-standing segregation and vast disparities in wealth between neighborhoods.Along with Bill Daley, the field of mayoral contenders includes two former Chicago Public Schools officials, the powerful county board president, a Black Lives Matter activist, a former state representative, and Lori Lightfoot, the woman tasked by Emanuel with reforming the city’s police department after the high-profile killing of teen Laquan McDonald by an officer recently convicted of murder. The field also includes Garry McCarthy, who was police superintendent at the time of the murder. In all, the race features a racially erse mix of political insiders and rabble-rousers.Enyia is the daughter of Nigerian dissidents who settled in the Chicago suburbs in the 1970s and continued to be active in their country’s politics. She speaks five languages and competes in Ironman triathlons. Her campaign has included running on neighborhood streets, joining would-be constituents in one- and three-mile jogs.In 2009 Enyia was hired by then Mayor Richard M Daley as a policy analyst, and she currently serves as executive director of a neighborhood chamber of commerce on Chicago’s West Side, where she also lives, a largely African American area struggling with violence and disinvestment.“I have a perspective other candidates don’t have,” said Enyia. “I see the guys who are part of the unemployed, dealing with addiction, the lack of access to mental health resources, I see that all right in my building.”Enyia said she got a text from Chance “out of the blue,” asking to talk about her vision. Though they hadn’t previously talked, they’d been in the same political spaces in Chicago, including around the “No Cop Academy” grassroots movement opposing city funds for a new police training center.While Enyia said her musical tastes are generally more “old school” than Chance’s, she admired his community involvement – including donating more than $1m to Chicago public schools through his charity.“He said he’d been a fan of mine for a long time,” Enyia said. “I was a fan of his too, because he had a track record of walking the walk.”Chance told the crowd at the Chop House that when he surveyed the “54,000 people” running for mayor, “I came across Amara. Who is just it. It was staring me right in the face… this is our Harold Washington” – the city’s first and only black mayor, elected in 1983.At the fundraiser and at a campaign stop earlier that afternoon at the University of Illinois at Chicago, students said they found out about Enyia because of Chance, and were won over once they learned more about her life and policy platforms.“It’s not just because she’s a black woman, she really wants to change Chicago,” said Terri Adams, 28, a friend of Chance’s who is especially impressed by Enyia’s focus on investing in public schools.Enyia advocates for an elected school board, a public bank, restorative justice, a boom in cooperative enterprises and greatly increased government transparency. She’s campaigned around the city, spending quality time in neighborhoods that residents say Emanuel and other candidates in the race ignore.Chance’s father, Ken Bennett, was a top adviser to Emanuel, and was also an aide to former President Barack Obama. He is now involved in the mayoral campaign for Cook county board president Toni Preckwinkle, a long-time political insider. “He loves his dad but they have different ideas of what the city really needs,” said Enyia.Kanye West’s support for Enyia is not as smooth a fit, considering his controversial bond with Donald Trump and recent erratic remarks, including his widely criticised claim that slavery was a choice.“It’s no mystery where I am on the political spectrum,” said Enyia. While that’s a different place than West occupies, “he’s open to different policies and different points of view, and I’m okay with that”.West first donated $73,540 to Enyia in October, the exact amount needed to cover outstanding debt from her 2015 run. A week later, West donated $126,460 to Enyia around the same time he announced on Twitter that he was “distancing” himself from politics. Board of elections records show no donations from Chance, but Enyia says his public support has been invaluable.Community organizer Jose Requena, 32, is among the Enyia supporters who think West could create challenges for her campaign. He described Chance as “what my generation hoped Kanye West would be”. But he also sees Enyia’s embrace of West as an example of her ability to reach across demographics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ed1983fb5a3b7c39acc028a2012e900da8daf5/0_105_3822_2294/master/3822.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae1367aa125eed259e7b827d277c4f7f","title":"democrats take orange county district to cap midterm rout of republicans","story":"Lottery winner Gil Cisneros’s victory cements a stunning realignment in southern CaliforniaThe Democratic party has captured another Republican-held US House seat in southern California at the weekend, capping a rout in which the party picked up six congressional seats in the state.In what had been the last undecided House contest in California, Gil Cisneros beat Republican Young Kim, who admitted defeat on Sunday, for the state’s 39th district seat.The Cisneros victory was assured on Saturday and cements a stunning political realignment after the midterm elections earlier this month that will leave a vast stretch of the Los Angeles metropolitan area under Democratic control in the House.With Kim’s defeat, four Republican-held House districts all or partly in Orange County, once a nationally known GOP stronghold, will have shifted in just one election to the Democratic column. The change means that the county of Richard Nixon’s birthplace and site of his presidential library will only have Democrats representing its residents in Washington, DC, next year.After more than a week of counting mail-in and other outstanding ballots, Democrats also recently picked up the last Republican-held House seat in Los Angeles county, when Katie Hill ousted Steve Knight. Republicans also lost a seat in the agricultural Central Valley.With other gains, Democrats will hold a 45-8 edge in California US House seats next year. The 39th district was one of seven targeted by Democrats across California after Hillary Clinton carried them in the 2016 presidential election.Cisneros, 47, a $266m lottery jackpot winner, had been in a close race with Kim in a district that has grown increasingly erse. It is roughly ided between Republicans, Democrats and independents, and between with Asians, Hiics and whites.“In one of the most erse districts in the country I learned that for all of our differences, we all care about the same things,” said Cisneros, who will be the first Hiic to represent the district.“Most of all, we want to live in a world brought together by hope, not ided by hate,” he said in a statement.

It is not normally cooked or served in a mosque.But on Sunday, vast quantities of chicken soup – often known as “Jewish penicillin” – were being made at the East London mosque by Jewish and Muslim volunteers to be distributed to homeless centres.Mounds of carrots, garlic, onions and celery were peeled and chopped on long benches by Muslim scouts, volunteers from Muslim Aid, members of the B’nai B’rith Youth Organisation and the New Stoke Newington Shul.At another table, LSE student Emily Otvos instructed fellow students on the preparation of matzo balls, the traditional dumpling served with chicken soup – despite confessing that she usually left them on the side.Tahir Iqbal, events director of Elite Caterers, was in charge of preparing 90 halal chickens for the pot. His company, which caters for Asian weddings and corporate events, donated the ingredients, equipment and transport for the cookathon.“This is a new experience for us. I’ve never made Jewish chicken soup before, but I’ve been practising for two weeks, including on my family,” he said. The nearest Asian equivalent was chicken yakhni, a spicy broth, he added.Across the UK, more than 2,500 servings of soup – kosher, halal, vegetarian and vegan – were being cooked at 20 venues, with soup-making events also taking place in Germany, Poland, South Africa and Australia, as part of Mitzvah Day – a day of social action led by the Jewish community but involving people of other faiths and no faith.Other activities undertaken by more than 40,000 volunteers around the world included hosting tea parties for refugees, collecting and sorting clothes and food for those in need, cleaning up cemeteries and parks, and visiting care homes.At East London mosque, 900 servings of chicken soup and more than 100 portions of vegetarian (spinach, walnut and yoghurt) soup were being delivered to projects run by the Salvation Army, St Mungo’s and the Acre Lane Centre, based in Brixton, south London.“Chicken soup is the Jewish food of choice,” said Laura Marks, the founder and chair of Mitzvah Day. “As well as its famed medicinal properties, it has all sorts of emotional properties – friendship, family, togetherness, love, nurture – they’re all in that bowl.”There was a common perception that Jews and Muslims did not get on, she said. “But Mitzvah Day is about the common values that underlie both religions – the commitment to social action and social justice. We are both commanded by our faith to do good deeds and contribute to society. Most of the Jews here today won’t have been in a mosque before, and most Muslims won’t have Jewish friends. But here we are, chopping vegetables together.”The East London mosque is one of the largest in Europe, and serves the UK’s biggest Muslim community. Until three years ago, there was a tiny synagogue next door, a remnant of the once-thriving Jewish community of the east end. It closed and was sold to the mosque.Jehangir Malik, the chief executive of Muslim Aid, which teamed up with Mitzvah Day for the event, said that in the 1930s the area would have been full of Jews. The chicken soup cookathon was “a wonderful initiative to bring our two communities together in a part of London which is meaningful to both of us and to spread a positive interfaith message around the world”.At 12.30pm, as cooked chicken was being shredded for the first batch of soup, the Muslim call to prayer rang out. “Food brings us together,” said Marks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/048314671716e3b6e0905e2f20b3b8f5ee33c96f/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3959f77e1372856af7bba7c08eb53af9","title":"apec leaders summit five key moments papua new guinea china","story":"The summit held in Port Moresby was one of the most tense in recent years and ended with no joint statementThe Apec leaders summit, held in Port Moresby over the weekend, was one of the most remarkable and tense in recent years. It ended with no joint statement from the leaders – a first in Apec history – and with the fight for dominance in the Pacific region between Australia, the US and Japan on one side and China on the other, coming out into the open. Here are five key things that occurred over a dramatic weekend:As the leaders gathered in matching red and yellow satin shirts for the obligatory photograph, their smiles belied unresolved negotiations that occurred over the weekend. The agreement that usually comes out of these summits was thwarted by tensions between the US and China over trade and security, meaning that for the first time in Apec history, the summit closed without a joint statement from the leaders.Papua New Guinea prime minister Peter O’Neill said the breakdown in talks was due to “the two big giants in the room”.Tensions were always going to be high between the US and China, countries which have been involved in an escalating trade war and which are currently in a battle for influence in the Pacific region.This was the summit in which the unspoken tug-of-war for the Pacific came out into the open.Chinese president Xi Jinping was attending Apec as a guest of government and arrived days before other leaders touched down. He visited roads and a school, built with Chinese money, and held a meeting with Pacific Island leaders, all of which were seen of ways for China to shore up support in a region that it has identified as geo-politically crucial.Speaking to business leaders he also raised the prospect of a “hot war” in the region.“History has shown that confrontation — whether in form of cold war, hot war or trade war — will produce no winners,” he said.Meanwhile, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison hosted a barbecue with Pacific Island leaders at the Australian high commission.Mike Pence, the US vice president, used a speech at the summit to implicitly warn Pacific nations off accepting financial help from China. He said infrastructure loans, which have been deployed by Beijing with Pacific countries, had “opaque” terms, and threatened the sovereignty of small nations.During the summit, Tonga confirmed that the Chinese government was allowing it to defer repayments on a reported $160m loan received from China for building projects. The deferral is for five years and was announced just before onerous repayments were due to start.In what was seen as a clear attempt to block China’s influence in the Pacific, the US announced it would partner with Australia in developing the Lombrum naval base on Manus Island.The atmosphere was so fraught at the summit, and leaders were so keen to influence the final communique, that at one point Chinese officials attempted to “barge” into the office of PNG’s foreign minister in an 11th-hour bid to influence a draft summit communique.Police had to be called to stop the office invasion, three sources with knowledge of the situation told AFP. But a Chinese foreign ministry official, Zhang Xiaolong, denied the incident, telling reporters: “It’s not true. It’s simply not true.”One of the most controversial aspects of the preparation for the summit was the purchase of 40 Maseratis by the Papua New Guinean government to transport world leaders around for the summit.Questions were raised about whether the cars would actually be used during the summit after New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern said she would not travel in a Maserati during the summit and diplomatic sources told Reuters that most leaders would travel in special armoured vehicles.During the summit photographs emerged showing at least a dozen of the cars were sitting idle in a Port Moresby warehouse.The government claims the cars will be sold on afterwards, meaning they would recoup the money spent on them, but locals raised doubts that the luxury cars, which retail in Australia for between $209,000 and $345,000 each, would be able to be incorporated into the PNG economy, where car-jackings are common, the status symbol is a Land Rover, and Maseratis are unknown.There were numerous reports that non-Chinese media outlets were banned from reporting on meetings held by the Chinese president, who arrived early for meetings with the PNG prime minister and Pacific leaders.On Friday, ABC journalist Natalie Whiting reported that only China’s state broadcaster CCTV had been allowed to plug in to get audio of an event between President Xi and Prime Minister O’Neill.Later, non-Chinese media were kicked out of Xi’s meeting with Pacific Island leaders and bussed out away from the venue. This included media from the Pacific countries whose leaders were meeting with Xi. It was a move described by Reuters Beijing correspondent as “a real own goal for China, which is always banging on about mutual respect and trying to convince the public there’s nothing nefarious about their play for influence in the Pacific.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5c3dcbaa4a9097c6456896e4c04d6bf835edaf8/0_0_2800_1679/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcab106858a8eff3bfed3cd65fc1d51d","title":"north korea defector next generation have no loyalty to kim jong un report","story":"In his first interview since his dramatic escape, Oh Chong Song says he does not regret leaving the NorthThe North Korean soldier who defected to the South in a hail of bullets last year is a general’s son but says most Northerners of his age have no loyalty to Kim Jong-un, according to a Japanese newspaper.Oh Chong Song’s dramatic dash across the border at the Panmunjom truce village in the Demilitarized Zone – under fire from his comrades – made global headlines last year, and saw him hospitalised with serious injuries.It is very rare for the North’s troops to defect at Panmunjom, a major tourist attraction and the only place on the frontier where forces from the two sides come face-to-face.The 25-year-old Oh is the son of a major-general, Japan’s Sankei Shimbun newspaper reported, in what it said was the defector’s first media interview.But despite his privileged birth – he described himself as “upper class” – he felt no allegiance to the North’s leadership.“Inside the North, people, and especially the younger generation, are indifferent to each other, politics, and their leaders, and there is no sense of loyalty.”He was “indifferent” to the rule of Kim Jong Un, the third generation of the Kim family to lead the North, and had no interest in how his friends felt about it.“Probably 80 percent of my generation is indifferent and has no loyalty,” he was quoted as saying.“It is natural to have no interest nor loyalty since the hereditary system is taken as a given, regardless of its inability to feed people.”Oh denied media reports in the South that he was wanted for murder in the North.After some unspecified trouble with friends, the Sankei said, he started drinking. On his way back to his post he broke through a checkpoint and, fearing execution, decided to keep going.“I feared I could be executed if I went back so I crossed the border,” he was quoted as saying, adding he had no regrets about defecting.A short clip posted by the Sankei Shimbun on its website shows him wearing a black jacket and a white top, speaking with a slight North Korean accent. His face is not revealed.The geopolitical landscape around the Korean peninsula has shifted dramatically since last year when US President Donald Trump threatened to rain “fire and fury” on the nuclear-armed North Korea.“I really felt that we were on the verge of war with the US,” Oh was quoted as saying. “The tension (that I felt) trickled down from the top.”Now a rapid rapprochement has taken hold on the peninsula and troops in the border truce village where he defected are to be disarmed.Oh said he understands the former comrades who shot him.“If they didn’t shoot they would face heavy punishment,” he said. “So if I was them, I would have done the same.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3702197.1542566394!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"couples getting married in 2019 face higher wedding costs due to vat hike","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrom the beginning of 2019 the hospitality sector will revert to paying VAT at 13.5 per cent. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThousands of couples getting married next year will see their wedding costs climb by hundreds of euro as a result of the VAT changes affecting the hospitality sector outlined in Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe’s recent budget.From the beginning of next year the hospitality sector will revert to paying VAT at 13.5 per cent after an extended seven-year break on a 9 per cent rate and wedding parties are likely to be among those hit hardest.In recent days hotels have started writing to couples with weddings booked for next year and 2020 alerting them to the fact that prices that have previously been agreed will not be honoured on the basis of the 4.5 point VAT increase.With many hotels charging well in excess of €10,000 for average-sized receptions – excluding the drinks bill – the additional costs to be borne by many couples will be more than €500.One bride-to-be who spoke to The  expressed dismay at the unexpected price increase and pointed out that, like most couples, they had budgeted right down to the last cent and will now have to jettison certain things to make sure the numbers add up. “I don’t know exactly how much it’s going to add because the VAT will only be on the food and won’t be on the alcohol but we have 110 people coming and it’s €79 per person and I think the changes will probably add somewhere between €300 and €500 on to the total cost,” she said. “That means we will have to scale back some of the things we had planned. I know it is not a huge amount of money but every penny is accounted for.” Spencer Simmonds, a Dublin-based wedding planner, said couples were increasingly raising concerns about the VAT increase. “I don’t think there is any real way of avoiding the charge,” he said. “Hotels could take the hit and absorb the tax increase themselves but margins can be very tight and I can’t see many going down that route.” A spokesman for the Department of Finance confirmed that the higher rate of VAT would be applicable for all weddings taking place from the beginning of next year unless couples had paid for in full before the start of January. If part or all of a hotel reservation for next year is paid for this year, the 9 per cent VAT rate applies to the portion paid. If the payment is made next year, then the 13.5 per cent Vat rate will apply"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3702119.1542561910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"each government department to adopt specific climate change targets","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton said there was no Irish sector on track to meet its carbon reduction targets. Photograph:  Colin Keegan, Collins DublinEvery Government department will have to adopt and implement specific climate change actions and targets in its own area of responsibility under a new policy initiative to be brought to Cabinet on Monday.As EU pressure increases on Ireland over its failure to meet legally binding targets on reducing carbon emissions, Minister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton is to seek Cabinet approval for an “all of Government” plan that will spread responsibility across all departments. The move is understood to come in response to an acceptance that climate change is now too big an issue for one department to ensure the level of decarbonisation required in the economy and throughout society is achieved. Commenting on Ireland’s climate change performance at the weekend, Mr Bruton said he wanted the State to be “a leader in responding to climate change, not a follower”. “That will require a significant step change across Government,” he said. The plan would set out actions to be taken in every department and State body “to stimulate the step change we need to achieve across all sectors of our society”, he said. Nine years ago Ireland was given a target to, by 2020, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to 20 per cent below what they were in 2005. The State has consistently lagged behind in reaching these goals and is on target to have reduced its emissions by less than 1 per cent come 2020. The EU’s targets for 2030 include a 40 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Climate and energy experts estimate Ireland will face EU fines running to hundreds of millions of euro for failing to reach the targets, but the Government insists the penalties will not be this large.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said in his speech to the Fine Gael Ardfheis that in transitioning from a laggard on climate change to a global leader, the State would meet its 2030 targets on reducing carbon emissions and adopting renewable energy. He said on Sunday that the Government was working on increasing carbon tax with a view to “giving it back to people in tax credits” as a way to prompt behavioural change.Mr Bruton said there was no Irish sector on track to meet its carbon reduction targets so “it’s not a question of singling out inidual sectors. Every sector has to make a significant effort.” The Minister said climate action was an area where the Government “needs to have a huge step up” as it was “way off target on the commitments we have made”. Referring to the proposed new approach, he added: “I will need the support of colleagues and the oversight from the Taoiseach’s department to ensure we can deliver on commitments we’ve made.The Government has an end-of-year deadline to produce a draft national energy and climate plan for the EU on the policy models the State is adopting. “It’s by December 2019 we have to have a detailed strategy with all the policy instruments in place,” the Minister said. “We need between now and the end of next year to build that road map that puts in the detailed policy instruments that we’re going to use.”A regulatory approach was being considered but the Minister said he wanted to give businesses and householders time to plan rather than introducing sudden changes."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3702142.1542567826!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mayo wind farm project takes on shades of corrib controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlan and Eileen Mullarkey, who have been affected by construction on the wind farm project in north Mayo. Photograph: Conor McKeownWhen an ESB and Bord na Móna consortium sought approval for a €600 million onshore wind farm in north Mayo, there was a cautiously positive response to a project with far fewer potential risks than the Corrib gas refinery.But a recent series of protests by a small number of people living close to the site at Bellacorick has highlighted wider concerns about the developers’ approach.“North Mayo has learned the meaning of community – through the gas – but the handling of this wind-farm project so far shows the State clearly has not,” says Brendan Lavelle of Keenagh Community Development.The joint venture, Oweninny Power Ltd, is based some 32km west of Ballina in a place best known for its “musical bridge” dating from 1820 and as the site of a former ESB milled-peat power station that was decommissioned in 2003.At peak Bellacorick employed about 360 people between the two State companies, and tears were shed when its iconic cooling tower was demolished in 2007.The benefits of the Erris wind resource were recognised by Bord na Móna when it built the State’s first commercial wind farm there in the early 1990s.The European Investment Bank has given €80 million towards the first phase of 29 turbines, now under construction at a cost of €160 million.During the An Bord Pleanála oral hearing into the project, the Corick Power Group – comprising residents living in Bellacorick, Crossmolina, Keenagh and Bangor Erris – made it clear they were not opposed to it in principle but wanted to ensure adequate benefit was returned, in the form of a gain to the community.“Community gain” has been an optional power afforded to planning authorities until it was specifically legislated for after 2006. An Bord Pleanála can attach it as a condition, as it did for the last section of the Corrib gas pipeline.The Government has recently confirmed approval for Shell’s sale of its 45 per cent stake in Corrib to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for more than €1 billion. The Corrib developers had paid €8.5 million over five years into a community gain fund administered by Mayo County Council, after previous efforts by Shell to disburse its own funds in Erris had proved to be very isive.However, even the latter fund was controversial, as a local authority audit found the council had allocated €451,000 of the sum to itself.Five years ago Mayo county councillors voted in a community gain rate of €10,000 per megawatt of wind energy generated for all wind farms in the county. This rate was set as a planning condition in 2016 for ABO Wind, a German company building eight wind turbines on Coillte land at Sheskin forest, 8km north of Bellacorick.However, Oweninny Power is paying a fraction of that, at €2,500 per megawatt annually. Residents ask how this can be. Mayo County Council says it was caught by An Bord Pleanála’s failure to set any community gain rate as a specific condition for Oweninny.In negotiations following a judicial review taken by the council, Oweninny Power agreed to a €2,500 per megawatt per-annum payment. The council said that, given the position it found itself in, it was “not practical or possible” to negotiate anything higher and forecasts it may still generate €5 million-€10 million over the lifetime of the farm.Oweninny Power says it has separately supported several local community projects in north Mayo during construction as a “gesture of goodwill”.A lack of local employment opportunities and the impact of construction on nearby residents are also bones of contention for some, while Brendan Lavelle in Keenagh, south of Bellacorick, is unhappy with Eirgrid’s failure to pay a community gain contribution when upgrading its 110kV line, although it is paying inidual farmers.Alan and Eileen Mullarkey, of Shanakilla, live along the L52925, a single lane road across the bog, which was not one of the three stated access routes in the original plan for wind-farm construction.Ms Mullarkey last June phoned Mayo County Council in frustration over use of the road by large haulage trucks working on the project. The local authority said it was “investigating” the matter when a resident phoned on June 6th, and Oweninny Power sought permission to use the road a week later “for exceptional circumstances”.The road has since subsided in part, a pillar cap has been knocked off a century-old bridge and the Mullarkeys and neighbours have photographs of frequent flooding incidents from the Oweninny river and tributaries. Deer disturbed by the night lights on the wind-farm site are roaming into local farms.The small number of residents have recently taken to protests, and are very upset that gardaí were called.Oweninny Power says it has agreed to improve the road, and is consulting with the National Parks and Wildlife Service on the “most appropriate approach to the issue of deer in the area”. It did not comment on whether this would involve a cull.Mayo County Council says it is aware of frequent flooding and is consulting with the developer.Fine Gael senator Michelle Mulherin has called on Bord na Móna and the ESB to “talk directly “ to the residents living near the Oweninny wind farm and “accept the principle that those communities living closest to the turbines should receive special benefits”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3702242.1542568137!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup and british government continue to clash over brexit deal","story":"Northern secretary Karen Bradley and the DUP are continuing to push opposing interpretations of the UK-EU withdrawal agreement as the battle to win over political, business and public opinion rumbles on in Northern Ireland.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds insisted that the Brexit deal threatened Northern Ireland’s union with Britain, while Ms Bradley will today repeat to Northern Irish business leaders that the deal is in the UK “national interest”.“It is clear that it is time to work for a better deal which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom, ” Mr Dodds put in a statement.However, Ms Bradley rejects this view.“The agreement preserves the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom, upholds the Belfast Agreement and ensures people and businesses that rely on an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland can continue living their lives and operating as they do now,” she will tell the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland. “The country now faces a choice between this deal – the only workable deal that fulfils the will of the referendum – or back to square one on Brexit.”Ms Bradley is delivering an address to the confederation as part of her efforts to go over the heads of the unionist parties, who oppose the agreement, to gain business and public support for the deal.The Northern secretary will take comfort from the fact that various elements of business from sectors such as manufacturing, farming, food and tourism have come out in favour of the agreement, contending that while not perfect it is better than no deal.“This is a truly decisive moment for Northern Ireland and the whole of the United Kingdom,” Ms Bradley will say. “The government has agreed in principle the terms for a smooth and orderly exit from the EU and the broad terms of our future relationship.“We are now close to a deal that will deliver in full on the result of the referendum. A deal that will see the UK take back control of our borders, our laws and our money.”However, the DUP, which has expressed considerable annoyance at business support for the draft agreement, continued to argue that the deal was a threat to the union.To buttress the DUP’s position Mr Dodds cited the comments on Sunday of the former Brexit British secretary Dominic Raab, who resigned because of his opposition to the deal.Mr Dodds said the British Labour leader understood the threat in the agreement. “Even Jeremy Corbyn gets it, although nationalists and republicans here are desperate for him to stop saying it,” he said.“I understand why some people fear a no-deal scenario. But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right deal.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3702271.1542571610!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord varadkar s speech was like a hobbit s front door very low key","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar  addresses the delegates. Photograph: Nick BradshawThrilled delegates knew they were in for a white-knuckle ride when Simon Coveney almost fist-bumped Regina Doherty onstage and then gingerly punched the air before inciting the Fine Gael mob to act like hooligans.The headline act was about to explode upon their ardfheis and the Tearaway Tánaiste wanted the crowd to make some noise.“In six minutes’ time,” he tantalised, “our party leader and our Taoiseach will walk to this stage.”Leo taking himself forward, in tune with the theme of the day.The country would be watching.“I know that this party has a reputation for being polite and mannerly and a little contained sometimes at events like this one,” devil-may-care Coveney told the crowd. “But not today, please! I am asking you to make a statement, to be heard, to let people know how united and strong we are as a political party right now behind Leo Varadkar.”There was a brief, polite pause and then the inflamed foot soldiers burst into a frenzy of genteel clapping. Guests in the diplomatic seating area were worried in case the rabble-rousing Minister for Foreign Affairs might start wrecking the gaff. But Simon settled down and there was no need to call security.Due to upstaging issues, seconds in command don’t often do the wind-up speech for party leaders. They are too far up the pecking order, too close to the crown. Somebody who won’t thieve some shine from the star – usually an up-and-coming candidate or a knockabout crowd favourite – is chosen.On Saturday night, the former rivals for the country’s top job stood together, recast as Ireland’s Brexit warriors.“We work together night and day to protect Ireland,” Coveney declared, just in time for the live TV broadcast and the showcasing of the wonderful Two Ts to a national audience.A wide black curtain was pulled back to allow Leo make his entrance from the back of the hall. They had to do this because after Simon’s podium paean (tough, calm, intelligent, educated, ambitious, compassionate, generous, change maker), Leo couldn’t fit his head though the double doors.He got a tremendous reception as he did some minor flesh pressing on his way to the stage, the Kongos song “Come With Me Now” pulsating from the sound system.“Woah come with me nowI’m gonna take you downWoah come with me nowI’m gonna show you how”As you do.Some bright spark put a joke early on in the script. It involved using one of the props – “ordinary” party members sitting woodenly in long rows behind the Taoiseach who had, apparently, asked him questions earlier which he would address in the speech. This was a way of getting over the makey-up “I met a man out along the road who told me . . .”These people had names, and when Leo mentioned them he swivelled his head towards the props to indicate that Tom or Lynda or Vera or whoever actually existed, and was there among them.Lorraine, it seems, wanted to know about extending the Confidence and Supply deal with Fianna Fáil.“I told her the truth. I said it’s not easy negotiating with the Fianna Fáil front bench,” said Leo, winding up for the big punchline.We feared we might suffocate in tumbleweed but a person began to clap, very loudly, and everyone joined in. Or at least that part of the hall which wasn’t wiped out by the lead balloon which was falling on them.The Taoiseach was clear Fine Gael would not go down the populist road of other parties by buying votes with all sorts of expensive promises like tax cuts and the like. Then he promised he would get middle income earners out of the top tax bracket and make sure more of them qualify for childcare subsidies.“As they should . . . They’re worth it! You’re worth it!”People may scoff and say that money should be used for far more pressing causes, but we noticed one of the private security men in the black bomber jackets standing at his position, hands held low, enthusiastically applauding.It certainly went down well with the crowd.Going forward was thrust forward quite a lot in a speech which was not backward about coming forward. It will come as no surprise that “Taking Ireland Forward Together” is Fine Gael’s new off-the-shelf slogan, from the clunky and unoriginal side of the marketing aisle.Did the Yanks see them coming and sell it to the party? Taking Ireland For . . . a ride? A fool? A small fortune? Hours of happy slogan and poster vandalising in prospect here.There was also a strangely jarring American word in Leo’s speech when he told the nation “Only Fine Gael can be trusted to protect your job, your pocketbook and your pension.”Then again, everyone knows Fine Gael ladies keep their pocketbooks in their fanny packs beside their cellphones.All in all it was a Hobbit’s front door of a speech – very low key.He isn’t a great speaker. If he was, Simon would have said it. But the delegates loved him, and he made up for his flat address by staying behind on stage for the best part of an hour posing for photographs with delegates.But the evening was rescued in style by the big screen in the Ballroom and a memorable rugby match. Leo was among cheering delegates urging on the home team to a memorable win over the All-Blacks. An elated crowd left Citywest in buoyant mood, all keyed up and ready for action.Heading home happy and sweatin’, even if the man who was supposed to do it wasn’t responsible. That doesn’t matter, Leo was exalted by association. A lucky general, along with everything else.Earlier in the day, for the benefit of party members and not for general release, a spoof video of various Ministers trying to be funny was aired.It was an entertainingly awful “spin the wheel” game where Cabinet members answered light-hearted questions. The whole farrago took place with whacky sit-com music running in the background.“Are you ready to play the game?” the Minister for Justice was asked.“I’m ready to roll . . .,” answered Charlie Flanagan, perpetrating a mortifying thumbs up.Then Heather Humphreys spun the wheel unenthusiastically.“What item did Leo Varadkar famously put in the dishwasher in 2017?”What did the Tánaiste have to promise his five-year-old daughter to make sure she would greet Pope Francis?“A kitten. A live one. It’s known as The Holy Spirit in our house,” replied Coveney.One viewer said his toes were curling so much he could scratch his arse with his foot.As soon as Leo left the stage, his team sent an email to all his subscribers.“I’ve just finished. Can you help?”Where to start . . ."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3702304.1542576581!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may to emphasise immigration control in selling brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May hopes to travel to Brussels this week to sign off on a political declaration on the future relationship between Britain and the EU. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesTheresa May will today seek sell her Brexit deal to people who voted to leave the European Union because of immigration, telling them that the draft withdrawal agreement returns full control of immigration policy to Britain.With the prospect of a confidence vote in her leadership still hanging over her, the British prime minister will tell a Confederation of British Industry conference that European Union citizens will not receive preferential treatment after Brexit.“Instead of a system based on where a person is from, we will have one that is built around the talents and skills a person has to offer,” she will say. “Not only will this deliver on the verdict of the referendum, it should lead to greater opportunity for young people in this country to access training and skilled employment.”Mrs May hopes to travel to Brussels this week, ahead of a special EU summit next Sunday, to sign off on a political declaration on the future relationship between Britain and the EU. This will accompany the withdrawal agreement approved by the British cabinet last week.She could yet face a confidence vote among Conservative MPs after a number of Brexiteers wrote letters in an attempt to trigger a ballot. However, Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the party’s 1922 committee, yesterday said he had not yet received the 48 letters required to hold a ballot, and that he believed Mrs May would win any confidence vote.Opponents of Mrs May are six letters short of the threshold to trigger a no confidence vote, according to The Sun. The newspaper said 25 had publicly declared they have submitted letters, while a further 17 have privately said they have written to the chairman.Concern The DUP, which props up the minority Tory administration in Westminster, continues to express concern about the draft deal. Its deputy leader Nigel Dodds yesterday cited the comments of former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, who resigned because of his opposition to the deal.“These are exactly the reasons why Northern Ireland unionism stands united in opposition to this draft withdrawal agreement.”Mrs May warned that toppling her would not help Britain secure a better deal from the EU and could stop Brexit from happening at all.“A change of leadership at this point isn’t going to make the negotiations any easier, and it’s not going to change the parliamentary arithmetic,” she told Sky News. “What it will do is bring in a degree of uncertainty, that’s uncertainty for people and their jobs, and what it will do is mean that it will be a risk if we delay those negotiations, and that’s a risk if Brexit gets delayed and frustrated.”Five cabinet ministers want Mrs May to seek a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement to allow Britain to leave the Northern Ireland backstop unilaterally. But Mrs May ruled out seeking a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his focus remained on getting the draft withdrawal agreement ratified. “Let’s get busy working on the future relationship. If we get the future relationship right we may never need the backstop,” he told RTÉ.Meanwhile, former British prime minister Tony Blair has described the draft deal as “a recipe for future chaos” and a “bad deal for both sides”.“Europe’s attitude is: ‘We agree this is crazy, but hey, if that’s what you guys want, okay.’ But it isn’t what we want,” he writes in today’s . “For the Brexiteers this is not really Brexit. For ardent remainers like me, it is a ridiculous outcome for the country. For both leavers and remainers it is not the best of a bad job, but the worst of both worlds.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

They are going to show us the photos. They say that our youngsters are inside, said Yolanda Mendiola, the mother of crewman Leandro Cisneros, 28. We are all destroyed here.Relatives are now asking for authorities to extract the submarine, though whether such an operation will be undertaken remains unclear.Relatives of the crew of the ARA San Juan submarine wait outside the navy base in Mar del PlataRaising the submarine to the surface is not impossible, but it is a very complex operation, and therefore very expensive, a naval officer told AFP, requesting anonymity.The discovery came the day after a somber ceremony, which Macri attended, at the San Juan\u0027s Mar del Plata base on the first anniversary of its disappearance.It also came just before the Seabed Constructor was to leave for maintenance in South Africa.

They believe there is still time to negotiate alterations, such as giving Britain a unilateral right to end any “backstop” arrangement over Northern Ireland.It comes at the start of a week fraught with danger for Mrs May, who could face a no-confidence vote as soon as Tuesday if 48 Tory MPs formally call for one. The DUP is also contemplating telling its 10 MPs to vote in favour of opposition amendments to the Budget legislation, in a move that would hugely undermine Mrs May’s authority.Read the full story. 2. Trump ridiculed for telling Californians to copy Finland and rake forestsDonald Trump’s weekend visit to fire-ravaged California has prompted a withering barrage of ridicule and anger after he suggested the state should copy Finland in raking forest floors to prevent a repeat of wildfires that have killed at least 77 people.He claimed he had received the tip from the president of Finland, who promptly said he could not remember offering such advice.“You gotta take care of the floors. You know the floors of the forest, very important,” said Mr Trump during his trip.“I was with the president of Finland and he called it a forest nation, and they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things and they don’t have any problem.” US President Donald Trump (2L) looks on with Paradise Mayor Jody Jones (R), Governor of California Jerry Brown (2R), and Lieutenant Governor of California, Gavin NewsomBut in an interview published in the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper, Sauli Niinisto said he told his American counterpart that the secret lay in an extensive monitoring system.Authorities are still sifting through the charred wreckage of California\u0027s deadliest ever wildfire, searching for any signs of the 993 people now listed as missing after the Camp Fire tore through the mountain town of Paradise.Read the full story. 3. Peanut allergy study points to live-saving treatmentPeanut allergy sufferers have been given new hope following the results of the largest study of its kind in the world.Children diagnosed with a severe allergy took part in a trial where they were given increasing amounts of peanut protein over a year.The landmark trial found that participants not normally able to tolerate exposure to even a tenth of a single peanut could eventually cope with two whole peanuts.Allergic reactions to peanuts can be very severe, and can even lead to deathIt is believed that by gradually building up tolerance levels, allergy sufferers could protect themselves from accidental exposure.Researchers from Evelina London Children\u0027s Hospital and King\u0027s College London took part in a study which suggests immunotherapy treatment, already used to treat pollen and bee sting allergies, could protect people from life-threatening reactions.Read the full story. The tally of injured in assaults, fights, and stabbings during France\u0027s “yellow vest” protests against fuel price hikes has jumped to more than 400 after a restive night.Fourteen of the injured were in a serious condition as the demonstrations against Emmanuel Macron, the French president, went into their second day.One person died on Saturday during the protests, for which people are wearing high-visibility yellow vests and setting up road blocks across the country. People block the A63 highway during a demonstration of Yellow Vests (Gilets jaunes) against the rising of the fuel and oil prices in Canejan near BordeauxOf the 409 injured, 28 are members of the police and fire brigade, said Christophe Castaner, the interior minister.About 3,500 of the estimated 288,000 people who took part in Saturday\u0027s protests stayed out overnight to continue demonstrating.Diesel and petrol price rises, which are due to come into force in January, are part of Mr Macron’s bid to wean France off fossil fuels.Read the full story.5. Swimmer dies in suspected stingray attack in AustraliaA swimmer died after a rare suspected stingray attack off an Australian beach while another two people were mauled in separate shark encounters this weekend.The 42-year-old\u0027s death came more than a decade after world-renowned Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin was killed when a stingray barb punctured his chest while he was filming on the famed Great Barrier Reef.The man was in waters off Lauderdale Beach, around 14 miles from Hobart in the southern island state of Tasmania Saturday when he sustained a puncture wound to his lower abdomen... possibly inflicted by a marine animal, police said.In the first shark attack of the weekend, a 24-year-old man, who was taking part in a surf lesson in waters off Seven Mile Beach, 81 miles south of Sydney, suffered serious cuts after an encounter on Saturday.That attack was followed by another on Sunday off the north coast, when a teenage boy was bitten on his arm and leg while spearfishing off the coast of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory.Read the full story. They played “Football’s Coming Home” at the final whistle and why not? This is not about triumphalism, arrogance or presumption. It is about enjoying a young England team enjoying themselves under a young England manager in front of a Wembley full-house.

Zverev makes statement with Djokovic victoryLadies and gentlemen, we have a new diner at tennis’s top table. And Alexander Zverev is only 21 years old – the youngest winner of the Nitto ATP Finals since Novak Djokovic in 2008.Zverev, the mop-topped German beanpole, has been the leading performer on the ATP tour – as opposed to the slams – for a couple of seasons now. But to beat the very same Djokovic in Sunday night’s final was comfortably his finest hour.Alexander Zverev of Germany celebrates victory with the trophy following the singles final against Novak DjokovicTo appreciate the scale of this achievement, you have to remember how bulletproof Djokovic has looked all week. Until Sunday, he had not even lost a set, nor dropped his serve, as he casually mugged four of the world’s best. One of them, ironically, was Zverev himself, who managed just five games in a round-robin match that Djokovic described as “not great quality”.Once Zverev entered the knockout stages, though, he was a man transformed. Not only did he pull off the ultimate double, knocking out Roger Federer and Djokovic – two consummate indoor players – in successive matches. But he also dealt superbly with the awkwardness of Saturday night’s conclusion, in which he was unfairly booed after ejecting Federer in straight sets.Click here for more  videos.Young Rohingya refugees fly kites at the Hakimpara refugee camp Please review our commenting policyComment: There is no crisis so terrible that it can\u0026#39t be improved by a brisk touch of houseworkNorth Korea weapons test is a shot across the bow of WashingtonJeremy Hunt urges Iran to release Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe ahead of trip to TehranComment: Sorry Theresa May, but you\u0026#39re no Margaret ThatcherParents should not let their outdated stereotypes influence their child\u0026#39s career, leading headmistress saysLargest peanut allergy study points to life-saving treatmentPamela Anderson criticises Australian prime minister\u0026#39s \u0026#39lewd\u0026#39 and \u0026#39smutty\u0026#39 comments in Assange spat Women are as tough as men, study suggests, as it finds extreme physical exercise doesn\u0026#39t have greater negative effects on femalesIndian telecoms director dismisses concerns about spread of fake news on WhatsAppBody of suspected migrant found under bus at Eurotunnel terminalI\u0026#39m A Celebrity...

Before Emily took part we were uncomfortable being more than twenty minutes away from a hospital and she wasn\u0027t able to attend play dates or parties without me or my husband being there.We had to constantly study food labels to ensure peanuts were completely eliminated from Emily\u0027s diet. Her allergy was very severe so even a small amount of peanut could lead to a very serious reaction. The impact on our family life was huge.Ms Pratt said by the end of the year-long trial Emily was able to tolerate around seven peanuts.Peanut allergy, a potentially life-threatening condition, has doubled over the last two decades and affects about 1 in 50 children in the UK.The allergy is rarely outgrown and is the most common cause of food allergy deaths.The PALISADE study was funded by Aimmune Therapeutics, which manufactures the peanut protein used during the trial.Please review our commenting policyComment: There is no crisis so terrible that it can\u0026#39t be improved by a brisk touch of houseworkNorth Korea weapons test is a shot across the bow of WashingtonJeremy Hunt urges Iran to release Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe ahead of trip to TehranComment: Sorry Theresa May, but you\u0026#39re no Margaret ThatcherParents should not let their outdated stereotypes influence their child\u0026#39s career, leading headmistress saysPamela Anderson criticises Australian prime minister\u0026#39s \u0026#39lewd\u0026#39 and \u0026#39smutty\u0026#39 comments in Assange spat Women are as tough as men, study suggests, as it finds extreme physical exercise doesn\u0026#39t have greater negative effects on femalesIndian telecoms director dismisses concerns about spread of fake news on WhatsAppThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendBody of suspected migrant found under bus at Eurotunnel terminalI\u0026#39m A Celebrity...

The average citizen consumes 17.5 litres of alcohol a year, according to figures. Meanwhile neighbouring Russia, home to the coldest inhabited town on earth, showed residents were drinking in similarly large quantities. Russians on average consume 11.1 litres of alcohol a year. The country meanwhile has a low number of sunlight hours over winter periods. Senior author Ramon Bataller, associate director of the Pittsburgh Liver Research Centre, said: This is the first study that systematically demonstrates that worldwide in colder areas and areas with less sun, you have more drinking and more alcoholic cirrhosis.Alcohol is a vasodilator, relaxing blood vessels and increasing the flow of warm blood to the skin.Drinking also is linked to depression, which tends to be more prevalent when sunlight is scarce.Dr Peter McCann, medical adviser to Castle Craig Hospital, a residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic in the Scottish Borders, contributed to the report.He told The : When the sun goes down and the temperature goes down, alcohol consumption goes up.  What is interesting is the correlation between sunshine hours and alcohol consumption. In Mediterranean countries such as Spain we found a lot of alcohol was being consumed but in a steady pattern. Whereas in colder countries with less sunshine, such as Britain, there is more of an emphasis on heavy drinking. Northern European countries show a higher prevalence for binge drinking.Dr McCann said there are several factors which could be the reason why some countries were more receptive to alcohol.  He said: In its early stages alcohol causes euphoria and can be beneficial to people in improving their mood and making them feel good. He said it might be the case that people living in darker parts of the world sought alcohol as a means to cheer themselves up. Dr McCann added: We now have new evidence that the weather, and in particular the temperature and amount of sunlight that we are exposed to, has a strong influence on how much alcohol we consume.Furthermore this weather-related alcohol consumption is directly linked to our chances of developing the most dangerous form of liver disease - cirrhosis - which can ultimately end in liver failure and death.He said it was time stricter laws on alcohol pricing were considered to combat the effect of low sunlight and cheaper alcohol on consumption.Dr McCann said: Advertising laws should be addressed with restrictions during winter months strongly considered.Evidence of the climate link comes as the WHO presents new data on alcohol consumption in Europe at a summit in Edinburgh today (Monday).It says levels remain high and that almost half of the adult male population are at risk of both short and long-term health and social problems due to harmful drinking patterns.Earlier this year, legislation on minimum pricing for alcohol came into force in Scotland in a bid to tackle problem drinking.Comment: There is no crisis so terrible that it can\u0026#39t be improved by a brisk touch of houseworkNorth Korea weapons test is a shot across the bow of WashingtonJeremy Hunt urges Iran to release Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe ahead of trip to TehranComment: Sorry Theresa May, but you\u0026#39re no Margaret ThatcherParents should not let their outdated stereotypes influence their child\u0026#39s career, leading headmistress saysLargest peanut allergy study points to life-saving treatmentPamela Anderson criticises Australian prime minister\u0026#39s \u0026#39lewd\u0026#39 and \u0026#39smutty\u0026#39 comments in Assange spat Women are as tough as men, study suggests, as it finds extreme physical exercise doesn\u0026#39t have greater negative effects on femalesIndian telecoms director dismisses concerns about spread of fake news on WhatsAppThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendBody of suspected migrant found under bus at Eurotunnel terminalI\u0026#39m A Celebrity...

This is Royal Army Veterinary Corps Dog Handler Private Beth Johnson, 19, from Bridgwater during a Land Combat demonstration featuring women in command posts at Copehill Down Village on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire.Workouts for womenThe ‘battle of the sexes’ has pitched men against women for thousands of years, usually with the connotation that women provide the brains and men the brawn. Sensational contests include Billie Jean King defeating Bobby Riggs in three sets, Donald Trump defeating Hillary Clinton in one election and Girls Aloud beating One True voice with ‘sound of the underground’ to clinch the top spot in the Christmas chart of 2002.But a new study suggests that the notion that females aren\u0027t physically as capable is outdated, and that with the right training, women are in fact just as tough as men.After testing a group of six British female soldiers who trekked across Antarctica, researchers found that they showed no more negative health effects than would be expected in men.The all-women team underwent extreme physical preparation for their expedition, and once on the ice, spent 62 days battling high winds and low temperatures to trek 1,056 miles while dragging sledges loaded with supplies and equipment weighing 80kg. They were the first ever all-female team to complete the journey.The British Army team of six women became the first all-female team to cross Antarctica using only muscle power. The study is the first to suggest that women are not more susceptible to the negative effects of physical exertion and, that with appropriate training and preparation, can be as resilient as men in undertaking arduous physical activity.Research conducted by Dr Robert Gifford from the University of Glasgow and scientists from the University of Edinburgh and the Royal Centre for Defence, monitored several markers of their health before and after the successful expedition. These included indicators of stress, reproductive and metabolic hormone levels, body weight and bone strength. The findings, presented at the Society for Endocrinology annual conference in Glasgow, indicated not only that markers of reproductive function and bone strength were preserved, but that some markers showed evidence of delayed, exercise-related benefit to their physical fitness two weeks after the expedition.Dr Gifford said, “Our findings contain some potentially myth-busting data on the impact of extreme physical activity on women. We have shown that with appropriate training and preparation, many of the previously reported negative health effects can be avoided.Speaking at the Defence Medical Innovation Conference in Birmingham, Major Natalie Taylor said of the group’s efforts: We did very well.Physiologically we coped very well, so our bones were as strong as we left. Our hormones, there was a little dip but within two weeks our hormones were back to normal which is really good.We also found that we lost fat, not lean mass. We didn’t lose any kind of muscle. Which is good because that’s what we gained before we went.”The findings come on the back of Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson announcing last month that all roles in the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, including frontline infantry units and the SAS, are now open to female recruits.The six women completed the 1,000-mile journey in extreme conditions, pulling an 80kg sledge behind them in temperatures as low as -42C for 62 days before crossing the finishing line at Hercules Inlet in January.Next year, after preliminary fitness tests and interviews, up to 20 women are expected to undertake the gruelling 32-week training course at the Royal Marines commando training centre in Lympstone, Devon.The recruits will train to exactly the same standards as their male colleagues and aim to serve as a regular Royal Marine.Commenting on the findings by Dr Gifford, Lieutenant General Martin Bricknell, Surgeon General, told Forces News: What this allows us to do is conduct research that is militarily relevant.The findings help understand the strengths and vulnerabilities in each gender and then make sure we as an employer can give everybody the best opportunity in their role, independent of gender.This is just one bit of science that allows us to understand that women have many strengths compared to men.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson called Major Nicola Wetherill, Major Natalie Taylor, Captain Zanna Baker, Lieutenant Jenni Stephenson and reservists Major Sandy Hennis and Lance Sergeant Sophie Montagne “trailblazing” and “formidable.”“They are an inspiration to us all and are role models to young people across the country.“They truly demonstrate why the British Armed Forces are the best in the world, and show that with hard work, courage, and determination anything is possible.A spokesperson from the Ministry of Defence added: “Women have already given exemplary service in recent conflicts, working in a variety of highly specialised and vital roles.“By opening all combat roles to women, we will continue to build on these successes and improve the operational capability of our military.”Workouts for womenPlease review our commenting policyComment: There is no crisis so terrible that it can\u0026#39t be improved by a brisk touch of houseworkNorth Korea weapons test is a shot across the bow of WashingtonJeremy Hunt urges Iran to release Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe ahead of trip to TehranComment: Sorry Theresa May, but you\u0026#39re no Margaret ThatcherParents should not let their outdated stereotypes influence their child\u0026#39s career, leading headmistress saysIndian telecoms director dismisses concerns about spread of fake news on WhatsAppLargest peanut allergy study points to life-saving treatmentPamela Anderson criticises Australian prime minister\u0026#39s \u0026#39lewd\u0026#39 and \u0026#39smutty\u0026#39 comments in Assange spat The 8 things you might have missed this weekendBody of suspected migrant found under bus at Eurotunnel terminalI\u0026#39m A Celebrity...

Pressed into a field in Hampshire, it seemed to mirror the look of the original Arecibo message, which gave a host of information about life on Earth that the originators hoped would be decodable to people anywhere in the universe.Where the original Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage had shown blocks of information including depictions of important chemicals like carbon, an illustration of DNA and a picture of a human being. The hoax reply was probably too perfect: carbon was swapped for silicon, the DNA was altered and the human being was replaced with a big-headed alien of the kind seen in science fiction.Arecibo Message anniversary honoured in Google DoodleIt was of course a hoax: among other questions, sceptics wondered why aliens wouldn\u0027t simply have sent a radio message, as we did, rather than dropping down to Earth to press a picture of themselves into crops and then failing to actually alert anyone. But it was a demonstration of the way the original Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage and the search for alien life that it grew out of continues to occupy the minds of people around the world.Scientists don\u0027t ever expect to actually receive a reply to the Arecibo message: it was powerful but specific, pointed at a galaxy cluster that will actually have moved out of the way by the time it travels the 20,000 light years to its destination. It was probably most useful as a demonstration of the technology and a thought experiment that led people to think about what such a message might actually need to say.Similar efforts have been launched that could have more positive results, however. A new initiative called Breakthrough Message – part of a broader group supported by a Russian billionaire and Stephen Hawking, which aims to find life elsewhere in the universe – has invited people to consider how best to write and send a message out into space, though has cautioned that for the moment it will not send out those messages.But some fear that a response wouldn\u0027t come in the form of a message at all. Instead, it would be something altogether more dangerous – and that\u0027s why they advise that we shouldn\u0027t send further signals like the Arecibo message, for fear that they would only put us in peril.Stephen Hawking, for instance, famously said that we should be wary of sending out messages into the universe for fear that they could be answered by someone looking to wipe us out – or, perhaps worse, someone who might wipe us out purely by accident. ‘If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans, he said in a 2010 documentary.And such criticism was even in place when the Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage was first sent. Just days after the dispatch was shot into space, the Royal Astronomer of England,\u0026nbspMartin Ryle, launched an intense blast of criticism at the idea, arguing that it might only alert aliens who are malevolent or hungry, and asking the\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union to ban any future messages.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said. Whether bitcoin is the one, whether bitcoin has solved its speed problem, or it\u0027s another cryptocurrency, only time will tell.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

We voted to leave and this proposal regains as much control as we can expect whilst still keeping us open for business with our biggest trading partner. Moreover, it delivers a clear path ahead that business so desperately needs.”Business groups welcomed the agreement as progress but the Institute of Directors (IOD) said more detail was needed for firms to assess how they will be impacted.IOD director general Stephen Martin urged ministers to think “long and hard” about how they react to the first-stage agreement.“Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for businesses, workers and consumers, and this is simply an inherent risk that comes with voting down any withdrawal deal,” he said.\u0026nbspThe IOD was “heartened” to see that provision had been made to extend the transition period, Mr Martin said. An extension would help to ensure firms have enough time to adjust to any new changes once the UK’s economic relationship with the EU had been agreed.But growing unrest in Westminster has made the prospect of the current deal passing through parliament appear remote.\u0026nbspTwo cabinet members, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, resigned on Thursday saying they could not support the draft agreement.

Amazon will go bankrupt, the billionaire said, replying\u0026nbspto an employee who asked him about the company\u0027s\u0026nbspfuture, in relation to the bankruptcies of big US retailers such as Sears.If you look at large companies, their lifes tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.Amazon picks New York City and Arlington for new headquartersA recording of the meeting was heard by\u0026nbspCNBC.In it, Mr Bezos\u0026nbspadded that the way for Amazon to stay successful is for staff to obsess over customers.If we start to focus on ourselves, instead of focusing on our customers, that will be the beginning of the end, he said.His comments accompany a wave of major success for Amazon, even as the company comes under heightened scrutiny.Amazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employeesOn Tuesday Amazon\u0026nbspannounced that New York City and Arlington, Virginia had been picked as the locations for its new headquarters, with a $5bn investment planned across both sites.Both Amazon\u0026nbspand local authorities in New York attracted heavy criticism after the company\u0026nbsprevealed that it would receive around $1.5bn in incentives,\u0026nbspbased on job creation targets, in Long Island City, and $573m in Arlington.\u0026nbspTwo of the sites chosen for Amazon\u0027s new campus in the city were originally intended for affordable housing and the decision is now likely to cost the city around 1,500 residential units intended for low and middle-income\u0026nbspNew Yorkers, according to\u0026nbspPolitico.\u0026nbspThe announcement followed an extensive beauty pageant process, which saw 238 competing proposals submitted from locations across the US.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAmazon, which now employs\u0026nbspmore than 600,000 people worldwide, said salaries at its two new bases would average more than $150,000, with hiring set to start next year.Staff at the company told\u0026nbspCNBC\u0026nbspthat employees are worried about the impact of government regulation and potential antitrust violations.In September the EU\u0027s antitrust watchdog launched a preliminary investigation\u0026nbspwhich is examining how Amazon uses data from\u0026nbspthird-party merchants.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They also discern that the most likely future path is for the UK to stay in the EU customs union. This is because:It will be guaranteed to do\u0026nbspso during the transition periodThe transition period could easily be extendedIt will be impossible for the UK to leave the customs union without the EU’s acquiescence andThe indications from leaked Brussels documents are that the EU sees UK membership of the customs union as the central feature of the future trading relationship.For 29 months, those in business have sought clarity and found only fog. For now, and despite every sign that the deal will be rejected by the Commons (at least initially) they are urging its acceptance – if only as the classic lesser of two evils.Mike Hawes, head\u0026nbspof the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders – representing millions of jobs and major UK export sector – was typical of many when he said: “For the automotive industry, Brexit is about damage limitation. The outline agreement is a positive step in avoiding the devastating consequences of no deal and securing a transition period.”The CBI echoed that view, saying: “This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transition period as a step back from the cliff edge.”The business world has for the most part\u0026nbsptried throughout the Brexit process to be as apolitical as possible. One of the more outspoken companies is Young’s, the pub firm, which said: “We have got as much as we can from a business perspective, and we need politicians to support this.”Markets believe that if there is a hard Brexit after all, the hit to the UK economy will be so bad it would need substantial devaluation of the poundThat provides an interesting counterpoint to the vocal pro-Brexit boss of Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, whose objections to the EU’s protectionism are well-known. Small business too has usually been more ided than big business, though in Northern Ireland, understandably, there is near unanimous support for the no hard-border deal secured by the government.The verdict of investors can be read more easily in the pound’s value, share prices and trading volumes than in press releases. As political backing for the Brexit deal started to unravel this week a familiar pattern re-emerged, reversing the upswing we had seen when it seemed there was solid cabinet support.\u0026nbspShares sank in companies that relied heavily on the UK market – housebuilders and banks for example – while those that are global and whose earnings are mostly non-sterling enjoyed a boost (because their euro, yen and dollar profits would buy more pounds when they are “brought home”). Markets believe that if there is a hard Brexit after all, the hit to the UK economy would be so bad it would need substantial devaluation of the pound to make UK exports\u0026nbspcheaper and overcome tariff disadvantages.There is a wider question, too, about the Brexit debate, which was colourfully summed up when Boris Johnson, when still foreign secretary, was reported as saying “f***\u0026nbspbusiness” in an overheated exchange. In other words, whatever the CBI wants is not necessarily the best for the UK economy as a whole.Thus, the Brexit debate can be seen as an argument between the producer interest\u0026nbsp– big business – and the consumer interest\u0026nbsp– families. The EU, through tariffs and other barriers,\u0026nbspprotects its\u0026nbspbusiness,\u0026nbspespecially farming, from global competition. The bloc\u0026nbspprovides a supply of cheap labour and makes food, clothing and many manufactured goods more expensive than they need be. For the public, yes, jobs would be lost in the short term in a hard Brexit, but there would be gains as the budgets of lower-income families would go further in the shops.\u0026nbspSo, just as in the referendum two years ago, business is mostly hostile to Brexit, as well as frustrated about the continuing uncertainties. Even now, business leaders have no clear idea about what the business environment will be like after 11pm on 29 March\u0026nbsp2019.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We voted to leave and this proposal regains as much control as we can expect whilst still keeping us open for business with our biggest trading partner. Moreover, it delivers a clear path ahead that business so desperately needs.”Business groups welcomed the agreement as progress but the Institute of Directors (IOD) said more detail was needed for firms to assess how they will be impacted.IOD director general Stephen Martin urged ministers to think “long and hard” about how they react to the first-stage agreement.“Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for businesses, workers and consumers, and this is simply an inherent risk that comes with voting down any withdrawal deal,” he said.\u0026nbspThe IOD was “heartened” to see that provision had been made to extend the transition period, Mr Martin said. An extension would help to ensure firms have enough time to adjust to any new changes once the UK’s economic relationship with the EU had been agreed.But growing unrest in Westminster has made the prospect of the current deal passing through parliament appear remote.\u0026nbspTwo cabinet members, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, resigned on Thursday saying they could not support the draft agreement. By Friday afternoon 21 MPs had publicly submitted letters backing a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Why in Wisconsin? Everybody assumes that’s because it’s cold.“But we could not find a single paper linking climate to alcoholic intake or alcoholic cirrhosis. This is the first study that systematically demonstrates that worldwide and in America, in colder areas and areas with less sun, you have more drinking and more alcoholic cirrhosis.”Drinking is known to increase feelings of warmth\u0026nbspbecause alcohol increases the flow of blood to the skin. It is also linked to depression, which tends to be more prevalent where\u0026nbspthere is less daylight.No safe level of alcohol consumption, major study concludesAlcohol \u0027hijacks\u0027 the brain to impair memory and cause cravingsAlcohol deaths up to 10 times higher among diabetics, study warnsThe study, published online in Hepatology, found a negative correlation between climate and alcohol consumption in\u0026nbspdata from from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Meteorological Organisation.As\u0026nbspaverage\u0026nbsptemperature and hours of sunlight decreased, the total alcohol intake per person, the percentage of the population that drinks alcohol, and the incidence of binge drinking all increased.Scientists said the findings justified stricter laws on alcohol pricing and advertising during the winter months.Dr Peter McCann, medical adviser to Castle Craig Hospital, a residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic in the Scottish Borders, said: “This weather-related alcohol consumption is directly linked to our chances of developing the most dangerous form of liver disease – cirrhosis – which can ultimately end in liver failure and death.“Stricter laws on alcohol pricing are surely justified when we consider the devastating combined effect of low sunlight and cheaper alcohol on consumption.“Advertising laws should be addressed with restrictions during winter months strongly considered.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland became the first country in the world to introduce minimum pricing for alcohol\u0026nbspearlier this year\u0026nbspin a bid to tackle problem drinking. Similar proposals are expected to come into force in Wales in summer 2019 and the issue remains under review in the UK.Roughly\u0026nbsp4 per cent of the UK population\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsparound two million people – account for a third of all alcohol consumption.There were 5,507 deaths attributable to alcohol\u0026nbspand 337,000 hospital admissions due to alcohol-related diseases or injuries in the year 2016-17.\u0026nbspThere were also 240 road deaths in Britain where one or both drivers were over the drink drive limit, accounting for 13 per cent of all road deaths, according to the Office for National\u0026nbspStatistics\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The top 10 countries that drink the most alcohol  Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The WHO is due to present new data on alcohol consumption in Europe at a summit in Edinburgh on Monday.It says levels remain high and that almost half of the adult male population are at risk of both short and long-term health and social problems due to harmful drinking patterns.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We still don’t know what will be decided at upcoming “crunch” European Union summits –\u0026nbspand the possibility remains that, even if a healthy dose of\u0026nbspgoodwill enables some kind of agreement to be cobbled together, Brexit will be messy.Whatever else, undoing a half-century of integration is bound to cause some distortion. So to be prudent, you might want to “Brexit-proof” your life, just in case. Here is my\u0026nbspfar from exhaustive\u0026nbspguide to some of the things you might (or might not) want to consider as departure day approaches.1. Stock up on loo rollWhat could be more essential to civilised life? Right now your local supermarket will happily sell you as many multipacks of Andrex (other leading brands are available) as you can transport home – but after 29 March\u0026nbsp2019\u0026nbspthere is a risk\u0026nbspthey may need to ration the supply. You see, some 50 per cent of the wood pulp used to make toilet rolls in UK factories comes into the country on lorries from Sweden,\u0026nbspan EU member state. When the lorries get stuck on some ferry somewhere, the factories will soon run out of raw material. They could make up the shortfall with the wood pulp that comes in from Brazil, although apparently that stuff isn’t as comfortable to use. You have been warned.Raab: Those fearing Brexit hit to car industry should show ‘mettle’2. Order your new car nowAround 85 per cent of the UK’s new car market is accounted for by imports,\u0026nbspand there are few vehicles you can buy that don’t have at least some European Union\u0026nbspcontent – including some famous British brands. The Mini, for example, has a crankshaft that crosses the Chanel more than a dozen times as it reaches completion. The Jaguar E-Pace, an excellent sporting SUV, is made in Austria, while only the Astra from the Vauxhall range is made here –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspagain, it\u0026nbspcontains EU parts. On the other hand, all of BMW’s four-cylinder engines for the likes of the 3 Series are made in Birmingham…Disruption to such automotive supply chains will make delays inevitable for virtually any brand.\u0026nbspTariffs on new car imports, if imposed by the UK, may add to the list price – if you can source the vehicle in the first place. Order now from stock and relax.By the by, if you own a Fiat, Kia, Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota, Skoda, Seat, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Vauxhall, Ford or virtually any other brand with parts from the EU, which includes “British” brands such as Mini, Bentley and Jaguar, then you might also want to buy a few spares. Just in case.3. Apply for an international driving permitThis is fairly crucial if you want to be able to drive legally “over there”.If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do...One of the main benefits of EU membership we take for granted is the Europe-wide recognition of national driving licences. This could conceivably end if we “crash\u0026nbspout” of the club. An international driving permit will allow you to drive legally throughout\u0026nbspthe EU you’ll need to\u0026nbspapply\u0026nbspfor it personally at a post office, for a reasonable fee of £5.50.4. Lay down some French wines, German salami, Italian pasta, Polish vodka, Belgian chocolates, Spanish manchego, Greek olives…With the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of these sorts of treats more tricky. There are British alternatives to many of them\u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspnot all, obviously. The commercial British olive, for example, is yet to make its appearance. If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do (no offence Somerset). You can\u0026nbspfreeze\u0026nbspharder cheeses and stick\u0026nbspsome pickled or “brined” cheeses in the pantry. The delicatessen then – such a continental word – is your next shopping destination. You’ll at least enjoy it, but try not to eat it all at once. Get stockpiling.5. Make sure your health insurance covers trips to the EU or EEAThe European Health Card and smooth reciprocal arrangements across the EU for member\u0026nbspcitizens in need of care could disappear. The safest solution might be to apply for some health insurance\u0026nbspthat will cover you in the EU for holidays and business trips.6. Review your investmentsNever a bad idea in any case. If you’re lucky enough to own some, including a (money purchase) pension pot, then be ready for the volatility a chaotic Brexit will bring. Currency movements will probably mean dollar, euro and other foreign currency assets will rise in value you may also find changes in the tax treatment of your stocks, shares, bond and real estate as the UK and EU settle down to their new, less convergent relationship.Fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated but it is something you need to be aware ofWithout going full Project Fear II, there may also be sharpish trends in inflation, interest rates and tax that you might not have foreseen. A change in the Bank of England bank rate, for example, will influence gilt and, thus, annuity rates for people who purchase one with their retirement pot (though of course\u0026nbspyou don’t\u0026nbsphave to go down the annuity route under the newish “pension\u0026nbspfreedoms”). This could be favourable, or not, depending on what happens, but you need to understand what might happen, so far as you can. As ever, do your own research and seek independent financial advice.7. What, the gîte has to go?The timeshare pad in Spain, the cute little conical cottage in Puglia, beach apartment in Cyprus, bolthole in Paris… all favourite British property investments, and hitherto unthreatened by discriminatory taxation or property laws –\u0026nbspbut perhaps no longer.\u0026nbspThere might also be some effect on the popularity of your place if you let it out to UK holidaymakers, many of who will obviously be stuck\u0026nbspin Blighty\u0026nbspeating the cheese and wine reserves they’ve built up (see point 4).Post-Brexit, there may be less certainty that British citizens, resident or not, will enjoy the exact same property rights and tax equality they do now. On the other hand, if the euro, Bulgarian lev or Croatian kuna strengthens against the pound, other things being equal, then the sterling-equivalent value of your real estate may go up.\u0026nbspThere again, fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated\u0026nbspbut it is something again you need to be aware of.8. Double-check the family treeYour ancestry, and one or two other conditions, might help you apply for a passport of another EU member state, should you want one.Don’t forget that although dual citizenship is permitted in the UK, it isn’t available\u0026nbspin all EU states, so you need to check if necessary, make a choice.Usually some form of parentage qualification can deliver a new passport from an EU nation – though a substantial investment can also secure one (see point 6). You will usually need to register your birth, even if it was in Britain, with the country you wish to become a citizen of. Here are a few of the basics to get the ball rolling (though there is much devilish bureaucracy in the detail so beware)...Surge in British people obtaining EU citizenship, new data revealsItalian citizenship: by being born\u0026nbspto an Italian parent and, in some circumstances, via an Italian grandparent. Or by naturalisation – at least 10\u0026nbspyears’ residency.Irish citizenship: yours if\u0026nbspsome of your parents or grandparents were Irish\u0026nbspor, under some circumstances, by marriage to an Irish citizen.\u0026nbspNaturalisation by residency will also get you an Irish passport.Spanish citizenship: for British expats it is possible\u0026nbspto obtain Spanish citizenship via residency, but you will have to surrender your\u0026nbspBritish citizenship – toss a euro\u0026nbspfor it. Alternatively, once you have lived in Spain for five uninterrupted years, you can apply for an “EU long-term residence permit”, which enables you to work and live in Spain on the same basis as Spanish citizens. You can\u0026nbspalso apply if you have a Spanish father or mother.Cypriot citizenship: been married to a Cypriot for at least three years? Time to celebrate!\u0026nbspCypriot parentage will also do the trick,\u0026nbspas will\u0026nbsp“citizenship by investment” – a property worth at least €500,000.\u0026nbspIt might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good timeMaltese citizenship: naturalisationresidency for five years should do it. But here too there is a chance of flashing the cash via the Malta Inidual Investor Programme – at least €500,000 in various combinations of Maltese government bonds, and the National Development and Social Fund. Five years of marriage to\u0026nbspa Maltese citizen is another route.\u0026nbspMost EU and EEA countries (eg Norway, Switzerland) are members of the Schengen scheme, meaning no border checks in any case for EU citizens.9. Order your European-made fridge, washing machine, dishwasher…Much the same arguments apply to consumer goods as they do to cars, though the prevalence of Chinese-made products (sometimes with European brand names) means that the possible delays and inconvenience are somewhat less for this class of goods. However, if you really desire a German-made Miele washing machine you might be wise to make a move on one now.10. Buy your foreign currency\u0026nbspnowI don’t have a Brexit crystal ball any more than anyone else but it seems reasonable to conclude that a\u0026nbsphard Brexit, the nearer it gets, could well bring about a hefty depreciation of sterling – as happened the morning after the 2016 referendum, when the pound lost about 15 per cent of its external value (though it did gradually recover). Then again, whenever there is a wave of optimism about the talks, sterling tends to rise. The pound would be expected to slide against all the major currencies in an unexpectedly chaotic scenario, so\u0026nbspif you wish to be cautious\u0026nbspyou could get your euros, dollars, roubles and rupees in now.11. Stock up on medicinesAssuming they have a long shelf life, that is. This is one of the most vexed of all the post-Brexit questions, about which we have heard a lot from politicians. All one can say now on the question of imported medicines is that they will, under UK law, be OK to use\u0026nbspin Britain if they’re already EU approved, as we will adopt all the European Union regulations from day one\u0026nbspof Brexit. However, like so many other goods, there may be delays in transportation, and it might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good time. The UK has a competitive pharmaceuticals sector, for now\u0026nbspthere is a reasonable chance that your pills and potions can be sourced by the pharmacy. Keep a weather eye\u0026nbspopen for updates.12. Au pairs, tenants and employees: let\u0026nbspthem go now or hang on for dear lifeWithout a legally sound withdrawal agreement, the rights and status of EU citizens living and working in the UK will need to be clarified, and there is no sign of that yet. Some may decide to leave the UK, even after many years here, which will inevitably\u0026nbspcause great disruption.\u0026nbspYou may therefore\u0026nbspwish to make some contingency arrangements of your own if, say, you rent a house to a Slovak family, have a French au pair or employ workers from Poland. The short story is that they may be hard to replace.13. Take advantage of “the exciting opportunities” offered by BrexitJoking aside, there will be some potential benefits for the new “global Britain”. If you’re the entrepreneurial type, you might well want to seek out new trading opportunities in China or India, as (or\u0026nbspif) tariffs and other restrictions that are now levied on goods and services in either direction are lifted. That could happen as a result of unilateral UK action or, in the longer run, through the kind of ambitious trade deals ministers talk so frequently\u0026nbspabout.All in all,\u0026nbspnow may be a good\u0026nbspmoment to start that business advising Indian students about how to get a visa and apply for a course at a British university. Provided of course the government finds such an arrangement with India that is compatible with its migration targets.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Engage in some cross-border arbitrageNot smuggling, you understand, but legitimate trade exploiting anomalies in inidual markets.If the Troubles return post-Brexit, it won’t just be due to the borderThis may be of especial interest to people living near the Irish border, who will have to make the most of whatever is coming their way this\u0026nbspspring. On the one hand, the prices\u0026nbspof various goods will erge because of movements in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspas well as duty, taxation\u0026nbspand regulation. The opportunities will be obvious. On the other hand, the EU or UK may decide to instal more stringent customs controls than before it’s\u0026nbspa sensitive subject. Or they could just forget about Ireland and leave things as they are, tolerating a certain amount of cross-border economic activity. Let’s be honest, no one knows.15. Watch your phone billOne of the greatest of the positive practical differences the EU Commission made in recent years was to cut mobile phone roaming rates among EU states.\u0026nbspIt is not yet clear whether\u0026nbspthat regulation will survive the Brexit process, although it may be caught by the UK withdrawal legislation.16. Check your flightOpinions, even at this relatively late stage, differ on how easy air travel will be post-Brexit. There are many EU regulations that govern passenger air transport\u0026nbsp(and freight for that matter). These\u0026nbspmay be overcome by UK-based\u0026nbspairlines setting up subsidiary companies in the EU\u0026nbspbut carrying on with business as usual – or not. Once again, confusion is the most likely outcome, and you may wish to exercise caution about booking your next flight.17. Learn to love your local uniThe future of European educational projects such as the Erasmus exchange scheme is under active discussion. More broadly, EU students can come and study in Britain at UK tuition fee rates, and that may not be so in future. By the same token, British students going to study in the EU may find themselves facing new fees and charges,\u0026nbspas well as having to factor in the impact\u0026nbspon their living costs of potential shifts to the exchange rate.18. Beware the expat lifeJust as there will be much uncertainty about the future of EU citizens in the UK, so there will be for those Britons living happily in EU countries, working or retired. There will be many issues to consider, some covered above: the cost of healthcare taxes on\u0026nbspproperty and income the payment or uprating of the UK state pension payment of local social security benefits gyrations in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspand the value of real estate across borders\u0026nbspremitted income from the UK the right to bring other family members to come and live with you voting rights and much else.19. Watch out for the RockSounds sinister – but not meant to be. Many Britons have links to Gibraltar, not just for financial reasons. Thus far\u0026nbspan under-discussed aspect of Brexit, Gibraltar is another UK territoryEU land border that raises an awful lot\u0026nbspof questions. The situation is made trickier because the EU has\u0026nbspgranted Spain a veto on future arrangements on Gibraltar. Nothing could change, perhaps\u0026nbspor “concessions” may only amount to the Spanish police having a role at the airport or the Spanish could decide to make life at the border more difficult, even though many Spanish workers rely on Gibraltar for their livelihoods.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march20. Don’t count on future working visits to the EUBy analogy with the US, if things really do get nasty\u0026nbspthen visa-free EU travel may be restricted to holidays and leisure. “Work”, even on a temporary assignment, may be treated differently, as it is by the\u0026nbspStates. Thus a special visa from the EU Belgium\u0026nbspmay be required if, say, a journalist wishes to go to Brussels, ironically, to report on the EU’s activities.\u0026nbspLikewise, an architect who wants to go Prague to supervise some construction work may need\u0026nbspan EUCzech permit. That’s because\u0026nbspif the UK\u0026nbspleaves the single market, British qualifications will not necessarily be recognised by EU states, as they tend to be now. Once again, a “worst case scenario” possibility that has\u0026nbspnot been much discussed.\u0026nbspSo there we are then. With luck, Britain won’t leave the EU at all certainly the pressure for a Final Say referendum is growing by the week. Or maybe we will do so in name only, or perhaps\u0026nbspacross a smooth, seamless transition that will take many months. Then again, Brexit hasn’t enjoyed much luck so far…\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

James Moore considers whether there is any room for social responsibility in the corporate world, or if we should just ditch the spiel on valuesClick to followThe IndependentBusinesses are stakeholders in society, and vice versa“These guys are mad. Call off the invasion. Their system’s going to eat them so we won’t have to. They have these company things that they’re allowing to bust the whole place up. Let’s just sit tight and clean up once they’re done wrecking it.”That’s what an alien might very well say upon looking at the way the titans of the capitalist system have been operating.\u0026nbspYou want examples? Ten years on from the financial crisis that caused a brutal recession and a lost economic decade from which we have still to fully recover and it isn’t hard to find people who’ll tell you that the banks could easily do it again.Tech giants make money from people taking out ads that are designed to corrupt democratic elections, while other companies wreck the environment.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the carnival of corporate scandal adds a new float every few months. Yet according to the Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, whose influence permeates through the Anglo-Saxon capitalist world, they’re all only doing what they’re supposed to do: increasing profits by whatever means necessary within the law.\u0026nbspIn his seminal work Capitalism and Freedom,\u0026nbspFriedman baldly stated that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits”.\u0026nbspHe had no truck with companies having any regard for\u0026nbspthe societies in which they operate, much less furthering socially useful goals such as\u0026nbsp“providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers”.\u0026nbsp“Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades,” he opined.\u0026nbspThat view is at odds with what you’ll often hear from modern executives, who like to talk about how important the “values” of the businesses they run are\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspbig up their role as “good corporate citizens”.\u0026nbspFacebook isn’t about making money. It exists to “connect people”. “Don’t be evil”\u0026nbspfamously used to be at the centre of Google’s corporate philosophy until it was quietly removed.\u0026nbspNow it says: “The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Google’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct.”Isn’t that nice? Milton must be turning in his grave. You hear similar things on this side of the Atlantic. I once suggested to a very senior executive at a rather famous FTSE 100 company over dinner that his talk about values was basically window dressing, and that cash was king. He became visibly upset.\u0026nbspYet Friedman would have found nothing to take issue with in the investor presentations put out by the aforementioned executive’s employer.\u0026nbspHe might have found today’s fiction of corporate social responsibility frustrating, even infuriating, but he wouldn’t need to scratch too far below the surface to be reassured.The Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real\u0026nbspwages\u0026nbspin the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago. Only those at the very top have made real gainsThe majority of western companies and western executives subscribe to and live by his doctrine in nearly every respect, even if they’re sometimes reluctant to admit it.\u0026nbspThat shouldn’t surprise anyone. They are legally required to do so.\u0026nbspBritain’s Companies Act of 2006 –\u0026nbsppassed by a Labour government by the way –\u0026nbsphas the fiduciary duty of directors to shareholders at its core.It states that a director must act “in the way he (sic) considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole”.\u0026nbspIn the case of big public companies, the members are shareholders, who invest in them, as Friedman stated, for the purpose of making money.\u0026nbspCapitalism red in tooth and claw rules, say his fanboys, because it has proved far better at delivering prosperity to those living under it than any of the alternatives (Friedman was writing at a time when the main one was Soviet-style communism).\u0026nbspSo, you corporate executives, it’s time to bin all that fluff about values. Go get yourself some CREAM (Cash Rules Everything Around Me, with apologies to the Wu-Tang Clan).\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe trouble with that view is it isn’t working so well any more, at least not for the masses, which might explain why extremists of one sort or another are finding such favour, extremists who are mostly bad for business – and yes that includes those on the right, in case you hadn’t noticed Donald Trump’s trade war.\u0026nbspThe Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real wages in the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago.\u0026nbspOnly those at the very top have made real gains. Since 2000 their real wages have risen by a cumulative 15.7 per cent, to $2,112 (£1,628) a week – nearly five times the usual weekly earnings of the bottom tenth ($426).\u0026nbspReal wages for the average American worker actually peaked 45 years ago, a couple of years after Friedman published a piece expounding on his profits argument in The New York Times Magazine.\u0026nbspSimilar issues are at work in the UK labour market. Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, a job site, recently noted that average pay is still below its 2008 pre-crisis peak.“If real wages had continued growing at their pre-crisis trend, the average person would now be earning £130 more per week than they actually do,” he said.\u0026nbspIn the boardroom it’s a different story. In a 2015 report, the High Pay Centre noted that CEOs in the UK had seen their pay increase by a factor of five since the late 1990s\u0026nbsp– despite no evidence that this resulted in better corporate performance, productivity or economic performance.\u0026nbspThe latter point was eloquently made by Charles Cotton, senior performance and reward advisor at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and\u0026nbspDevelopment, during a hearing of the parliamentary business committee in June.\u0026nbspYet despite the occasional shareholder rebellion, there is scant sign of any real slowdown. A more recent report by the centre found that CEO pay leapt by 11 per cent in 2017, more than four times the pace at which the average worker’s pay increased.\u0026nbspFriedman argued\u0026nbspthat a corporate executive has direct responsibility to his employers “to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Mark Zuckerberg meets world leaders – in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.President Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingPresident Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingBut, while they conform to that for the most part, when it comes to the question of their pay –\u0026nbspthey clearly break the rule. They and the non-executive directors who set it frequently act in ways that are ultimately opposed to shareholders interests.\u0026nbspThe situation reached its nadir in the UK with Persimmon Homes and its potential payment of £600m, slated to be shared among just over 130 executives. CEO Jeff Fairburn was due to receive more than £100m through it, although a public furore eventually saw him agreeing to reduce it to £75m.\u0026nbspThe company had been successful on his watch, it’s true, but that success was largely fuelled by the government-funded help to buy scheme, which underwrites mortgages for the first-time buyers Persimmon targets.\u0026nbspIt thus owed much of its success to a de facto public subsidy.\u0026nbspThe chair, and the chair of the remuneration committee who resigned in the midst of the scandal, admitted that the bonus scheme should have been capped, but this was too late to save the shareholders they were supposed to represent, who ended up handing over nearly 10 per cent of their company to its executives. No wonder one commentator referred to it as an act of “corporate looting”.\u0026nbspFiduciary duty? Forget about it!\u0026nbspPart of the reason for the repeated occurrence of this sort of thing is the way the modern company has become, in effect, ownerless – widely held by erse groups of institutional investment funds which buy and sell electronically, rarely vote on company resolutions and sometimes may only be on the shareholder register for a matter of days, even hours.\u0026nbspRemuneration committees would have you believe that they seek to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders, despite their lack of oversight, by making them shareholders too. CREAM for all!Facebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to comeThe problem with that analysis is executives get their shares for free, and if something is free you don’t really value it. They rarely put their own money at risk. Perish the thought.\u0026nbspThis too often leads to them throwing caution to the wind in pursuit of potentially huge payouts. Why not?If their employer fails really badly, keels over and dies halfway down the track from an overenthusiastic application of the whip, they may lose their jobs. But corporate executives are rarely out of work for long.\u0026nbspTake a look at the career of Andy Hornby, as an example. The HBOS CEO had his hand on the tiller when the bank fell off a cliff, and the government had to step in and find a rescuer (Lloyds) which it then had to bail out.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspHornby, who was sharply criticised in a report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, ought to have been unemployable after that. But it wasn’t long before he found a new role as the chief executive of Alliance Boots, before moving on to bookmaker Coral.\u0026nbsp​RBS’s Fred Goodwin wasn’t so lucky thanks to his status as the bogeyman of British banking. But nearly all of his boardroom colleagues had secured alternative work within a couple of years of that bank’s collapse. One wonders what will now happen to those who spent time in the Carillion boardroom. Its executives also went for the bonus long shot jackpot. Expansion and profits uber alles, until the roulette wheel threw up a double zero.There was no bailout in that case, but the taxpayer was nonetheless left with a hefty bill in the wake of yet another glaring example of the capitalism Friedman advocated eating itself. But there are some companies that have eschewed Friedman’s ideas in another, more laudable respect, and with intriguing results.I’m not talking here about the corporate social responsibility\u0026nbspprogrammes most big businesses like to run. They’re often little more than extensions of the marketing budget, designed to send a message to consumers: “Hey you lot, come spend with us. You can feel good about it because even though we screw up the environment, look we’ve built a well in Senegal and we let our people go and help inner-city kids in their lunch hours.”I am instead thinking of those businesses that have actively sought to promote ersity (a favourite of the current crop of reformers) through their hiring\u0026nbsppractices.\u0026nbspFar from suffering through doing so, they have benefited, and handsomely.\u0026nbspMcKinsey, a management consultant renowned for its hard-headed intellectual rigour, sought to study the impact on the\u0026nbspcorporate profitability of hiring both more women and more staff from a minority ethnic background.\u0026nbspIts report –\u0026nbspDelivering Through Diversity –\u0026nbspshows that companies that do this make more money.\u0026nbspThe firm examined 1,000 companies from 12 countries for the 2017 study.\u0026nbspThose with workforces in the top 25 per cent for ethnic ersity were 33 per cent more likely to see higher than average profits than those in the lowest. When it came to gender ersity the figure was 21 per cent.\u0026nbspThe findings particularly stressed the importance of these groups being hired to both management roles (where they are often hardest to find) and in revenue-generating “line”\u0026nbsppositions from where executives are typically drawn.\u0026nbspCompanies that do so comply with Friedman’s demands that they maximise profits by taking his prescription and doing the opposite. \u0026nbspBut the question of whether the “profit at all costs” aim isn’t still destructive remains.\u0026nbspPutting profits first has left Britain with water companies that impose hosepipe bans while gallons upon gallons of water pours into its streets from leaking pipes.\u0026nbspIt has produced the railway debacles that have shattered the faith of the public in privatisation.\u0026nbspIt was for the purposes of bringing in a few extra dollars that Facebook allowed itself to be used by those seeking to influence the US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.All these demonstrate how self-defeating corporate behaviour that puts profits above society can be. The water industry is now dealing with tougher regulation, while the government is poised to announce a review into how rail services are delivered.\u0026nbspIf Labour comes to power both industries face nationalisation, an idea that is finding increasing favour with the public.\u0026nbspFacebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to come. There probably should be.\u0026nbspWould all this have happened were these businesses to have taken their “social responsibilities” more seriously?It\u0027s not just in the field of hiring that companies would benefit from thinking a little more carefully about what they do and how they do it.\u0026nbspEco-friendly buildings? That’s your energy bill down.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutesAct to cut emissions and curb other environmentally damaging behaviours? The costs of environmental destruction could be reduced, resulting in, for example, lower insurance premiums.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutes.\u0026nbspIt’s worth considering the experience of Nationwide and John Lewis, one a member-owned mutual, the other an employee-owned partnership, at this point.\u0026nbspThey aren’t without their failings. Nationwide, for example, is as guilty of overpaying its executives as some banks.But as a rule, they manage to balance both long-term financial success, something their owners are still interested in, with a more enlightened stance towards the society they operate within than some of their peers.John Lewis’s constitution is a particularly worthy example. It sets out employee partners’ rights and responsibilities and defines “how power is shared and our collective responsibilities to others”.Mutuals and partnerships fail just as public companies do. But as often as not it is when they follow the destructive playbook of the latter, with too little oversight brought to bear on over-powerful and overpaid executives seeking to maximise profits above all else and taking silly risks to do so. \u0026nbspPerhaps it’s time to consider a revised Companies Act to better balance shareholders’ interests with those of other stakeholders. A very senior Tory, from the party’s sane (non-Brexiteer) wing, pooh-poohed this notion in conversation with me. They argued that an employee, for example, could never be ranked alongside the shareholder owner. But why not? As I’ve tried to demonstrate, it might ultimately work in their favour.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis, where the employees are the owners, hasn’t been immune from the challenges afflicting the high street. But most of its stock market-listed department store rivals would kill to be in the position it is in.\u0026nbspWorks councils are commonplace in Europe, as is employee representation on boards, something Theresa May briefly talked about before beating a hasty retreat. \u0026nbspJohn Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield to step down in 2020Diversity makes companies richer says McKinsey. Investors take noteIt is true that they haven’t necessarily\u0026nbspserved to curtail executives’ worst instincts –\u0026nbspit isn’t hard to find examples of excessive pay at German companies for example. But look at Germany\u0026nbspand look at Britain and ask yourself which has the better way of doing things. Would anyone other than a die-hard nationalist say anything other than “Vorsprung Durch Technik”?\u0026nbspBritain, and other western nations, have also given businesses responsibility for functions they never had when Friedman was writing.\u0026nbspSo, yes, society does have a big stake in how they are run, and governed. It is high time that was recognised. Society needs seats on the board, a place in the constitution,\u0026nbspa role in corporate thinking. So do workers.\u0026nbspWhen Tony Blair coined the phrase “stakeholder” it was widely criticised as a buzzword (he was rather fond of them).\u0026nbspBut businesses are stakeholders in society, just as society is a stakeholder in businesses.\u0026nbspThe betterment of one\u0026nbspfavours the other, not least because, as that McKinsey study shows, more society can ultimately lead to more money. More CREAM for everyone.It’s time for us to recognise that and to start looking at ways of reforming the system. It really isn’t serving us very well.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It failed to see it – but that failure puts a limit on how big the rock can be, since if it was large enough it would have been spotted, according to a new paper published in\u0026nbspthe Astronomical Journal and coauthored by scientists at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.Asteroid could have been spacecraft sailing past us, say scientistsThat helps to lead credence to the theory that the relatively small object is being pushed along by gas that was being thrown out of the object. That gave the effect of adding thrust as it travelled through the solar system, speeding it up.It was that strange speeding up behaviour that led scientists to suggest that it could be an alien probe, sent past Earth by a distant civilisation. The extra propulsion could be caused by the object working as a lightsail, designed to be carried along by solar radiation, Harvard scientists recently suggested.The alternative and more accepted theory of frozen gases inside the object being expelled and pushing it along was dependent on Oumuamua\u0026nbspbeing smaller than typical comets inside of our solar system. With the determination that it probably is, the research seems to suggest theories about it being an alien spacecraft are less likely.Oumuamua has been full of surprises from day one, so we were eager to see what Spitzer might show, said David Trilling, lead author on the new study and a professor of astronomy at Northern Arizona University. The fact that Oumuamua was too small for Spitzer to detect is actually a very valuable result.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And they produce them prolifically, depositing between 80 and 100 cubes each night.Australia’s amazing megafauna were wiped out by humans, study findsWombats’ distinctive defecation has an important function, allowing the animals to pile their faeces high to mark their territory and communicate through scent.The pellets’ flat sides mean they can be placed prominently on logs and rocks without rolling away, making them more likely to catch the eye of a mate.But scientists have always been uncertain how wombats – which have circular anuses – fashion their faeces into their unusual shape. Now,\u0026nbspa team of US mechanical engineers and Australian biologists believe they have flushed away any doubt.Lead study author Patricia Yang, a postdoctoral fellow at the Georgia Institute of Technology, set out to investigative if differences in wombats’\u0026nbspsoft tissue structures might explain their oddly shaped dung.“The first thing that drove me to this is that I have never seen anything this weird in biology. That was a mystery,” said Ms Yang, who\u0026nbspstudies the hydrodynamics of fluids, including blood, processed food and urine\u0026nbspin the bodies of animals.She added: “I didn’t even believe it was true at the beginning. I googled it and saw a lot about cube-shaped wombat poop, but I was sceptical.”The researchers\u0026nbspstudied the digestive tracts of wombats that had been put down after being hit by road vehicles\u0026nbspin Tasmania, Australia.Near the end of the intestine, they found that faeces changed from liquid\u0026nbspstates to solid states made up of small, separated cubes. The researchers concluded that the varying elastic properties of wombats’ intestinal walls allowed for cube formation.In the manmade world, cubic structures are\u0026nbspcommonly produced by injection moulding or extrusion. But in nature the shape is extremely rare: wombats are the only known species capable of producing cubes organically.Ms Yang said her findings could have implications for manufacturing, as well as contributing to scientific understanding of soft tissue transportation.“We currently have only two methods to manufacture cubes: We mould them, or we cut them. Now we have this third method,” Ms Yang said. “It would be a cool method to apply to the manufacturing process – how to make a cube with soft tissue instead of just moulding it.“We can understand how to move this stuff in a very efficient way.”Scott Carver, an Australian biologist involved in the study, added: “There is much general interest from the public, both in Australia and internationally, about how and why wombats create cube-shaped faeces. “Many ideas, some more entertaining than others, have been put forward to explain this, but until this study nobody had ever investigated the cause. This has been a fantastic collaboration, which shows the value of interdisciplinary research for making new scientific discoveries.”The researchers will present their findings at an annual meeting of the\u0026nbspAmerican Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics in Atlanta, Georgia, this week.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightSocial jet lag is a new phenomenon where people shift their sleeping patterns backwards and forwards during weekends and holidays. It is thought to be exaggerated by disruptive things like phones and social networks that encourage people to stay up and follow the news, and\u0026nbspit is thought to affect a vast proportion of the population.Usually, people are forced to wake up much earlier than their biological clock would suggest, as they get up for work. At the weekends, people will often move back again, going to sleep later and making up for it with lie-ins in the morning.This is the reason you\u0027re not sleeping wellNow a new study has found that appears to be causing social jet lag, where people are disrupting their sleep pattern between the week and the weekend.The new research came from a study that looked at\u0026nbspthe Twitter activity of more than 246,000 users from 2012 to 2013. Those tweets were tagged with geographical location, allowing researchers to use them to understand when people were going to sleep and waking up.It found that people across the US seemed to sleep in and tweet later during times that saw large amounts of holidays. Previously, scientists had suspected that social jet lag might change with the seasons and the amount of daylight – and while it does differ through the year, that appears to be more a consequence of the way people\u0027s social schedules change, rather than anything seasonal in itself.We started the study expecting it to be a solar or seasonal effect – that your internal clock will shift in the summer and that will lead to decreases in social jet lag, said Aaron Dinner, professor of chemistry and one of the study\u0027s senior authors. But in fact, that\u0027s not what we found at all. People get up later on weekdays in the summer because their social constraints are relaxed. Weekend behaviour – and presumably a person\u0027s biological clock – does not change much over the year in most counties.The researchers also found that the data about sleep correlated with obesity rates: places that tweeted until later also saw higher rates of obesity. They also correlated with sleep data taken from more traditional studies.I was impressed that so much could be learned from this purely public data set that was not at all intended to tell you about sleep, said Michael Rust, associate professor of molecular genetics, cell biology and physics and the study\u0027s other senior author. In fact, we could rediscover things like the correlation with obesity or levels of social jet lag based on time zone that were found in other studies where people designed surveys to ask about sleep directly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For these reasons I cannot support the proposed agreement in parliament and would hope that Conservative MPs would do likewise.”The cabinet’s backing, however, means the EU are set to give the green light to a\u0026nbspEuropean Council\u0026nbspsummit at the end of November, which if successful could see a vote on the draft deal in the house of commons in early December.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker.

This would\u0026nbsphave enormous water requirements in a nation already facing a national freshwater shortage.With a total spend of over £13,000, the two UK-backed projects were intended to export British expertise to kick-start proceedings and see pilot projects established in China within three years.Given the local opposition, legal troubles and environmental issues that have plagued British fracking, campaigners questioned the government’s involvement in operations overseas.“It is quite unbelievable that the UK should have the hubris to suggest that it can export a regulatory system that is clearly not fit for purpose,” said Barbara Richardson, a spokesperson from Frack Free Lancashire.Energy minister Claire Perry has emphasised the importance of shale gas as a relatively clean “bridge fuel” that will allow the transition to a low carbon economy, but critics are dubious about this goal.“With fracking and any other form of fossil gas, there is a huge risk of lock-in – which means that it won’t get up and running fast enough, and when investors are putting money into these operations they are putting it in for 40 or 50 years,” said Ms Markova.“In 40 years’ time we should not be using any fossil fuels whatsoever.”To meet its commitments under the Paris climate agreement, she concluded that the UK must stop financing any more fossil fuel extraction in foreign countries.Rose Dickinson from Friends of the Earth, who collaborated with Platform and Christian Aid to produce the report, said: “Our government’s claim to be climate leaders cannot be taken seriously while it continues to push fracking at home and abroad.“We need to be moving away from fossil fuels, not showing other countries the best way to dig up more.”Responding to the report, a spokesperson from\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspForeign and\u0026nbspCommonwealth Office said:\u0026nbsp“The UK’s aid investment is creating a safer, healthier and more prosperous world and is in the UK’s interest.“Gas has the potential to be a reliable energy source as countries transition towards a clean energy future, and these programmes are aimed at sharing UK expertise to help ensure that their exploration or development of resources like natural gas is done to high environmental standards.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

followIndy PoliticsTheresa May will seek to regain the initiative in the row over her Brexit plans by declaring that they stop EU citizens being able to “jump the queue” into Britain.The prime minister will say that under the new system, people will be given the right to live in the UK based on skills instead of where they come from.Ms May’s attempt to shift the debate onto immigration and away from technical issues around the Irish border marks an effort to fight back against Eurosceptic Tories trying to depose her.Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn will also give a speech on Monday attacking the PM’s approach as “a botched, worst-of-all-worlds deal”.On Sunday the prime minister sought to underline how it is future relations with the EU, and not the “withdrawal agreement” including the controversial Irish “backstop”, that will deliver the Brexit people voted for in 2016.Building on that theme, she will say in a speech on Monday: “In the future, outside the EU, immigration will continue to make a positive contribution to our national life, but the difference will be this – once we have left the EU, we will be fully in control of who comes here.“It will no longer be the case that EU nationals, regardless of the skills or experience they have to offer, can jump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi.“Instead of a system based on where a person is from, we will have one that is built around the talents and skills a person has to offer.”Downing Street believes immigration will be central in the fight to win support for the prime minister’s Brexit deal, ahead of a critical vote in parliament due in December.It is widely accepted that the issue was at the very heart of many people’s reasons for backing the Leave campaign, but it has not yet featured in the debate about the merits of the actual Brexit deal struck by Ms May.She will add during her speech at the CBI in London: “Not only will this deliver on the verdict of the referendum.“It should lead to greater opportunity for young people in this country to access training and skilled employment.”The prime minister will travel to Brussels this week to see European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, ahead of a summit to sign off both the withdrawal agreement and outline future framework on 27 November.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march –

continuing their push to oppose her plans, to rally support against them in the commons and to raise enough letters calling for her resignation to force a vote of no confidence in her.It currently looks doubtful that Ms May’s plans have enough support from Conservative benches to be passed by the commons, but No 10 are now beginning a drive to turn Tory MPs who are as of yet unsure how they will vote.In his speech to the CBI, Mr Corbyn will criticise the government for spending two years negotiating a deal that he argues will “leave the country in an indefinite halfway house without a real say over our future”.He will say: “If the prime minister is unable to negotiate an agreement that can win a majority in parliament and work for the whole country, Labour’s alternative plan can and must take its place.”The opposition leader said that his plan would prioritise a “new comprehensive and permanent customs union”, a guarantee for workers’ rights and protections for consumers and the environment, and a strong relationship with the single market.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign

Voters polled also made it clear they do not want a general election with 50 per cent opposing another immediate vote for parliament and only 26 per cent backing the idea. Crucially, the poll also reveals that the efforts by Remainers to scare voters away from supporting no deal with the EU have failed.                Brexit deal opinion polls latest: THIS is how British public feel                Theresa May VS Boris Johnson: Poll reveals who Britons prefer as PMAsked about their concerns with Brexit, 50 per cent said they were not worried about free travel to Europe, 47 per cent not worried about a shortage of medicines, and 54 per cent unconcerned about a shortage of food.Tory MP Peter Bone, the founder of the pro-Brexit Grassroots Out campaign group, said: \u0026ldquoThis poll just proves what I am finding on the door step and in my mail.\u0026ldquoNobody is writing or asking me for a second referendum, there is no real support for it out there.Prime Minister Theresa May holds a news conference at Downing Street (Image:  Ian VoglerPool via Reuters)47 per cent not worried about a shortage of medicines (Image: Matt CardyGetty Images)\u0026ldquoYou have to wonder what it would even achieve.

Their hopes of a vote as early as today appeared to be evaporating over the weekend.PM Theresa May is insisting her Brexit deal will give us back the control of our borders (Image: BEN STANSALLAFPGetty Images)Dominic Raab resigned his role of Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union last week (Image: TOLGA AKMENAFPGetty Images)Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the ruling body of Tory backbenchers and custodian of the letters demanding a confidence ballot, said that the threshold had not been reached.He also predicted it would be very likely the Prime Minister would win such a vote.By last night, only 25 Tory MPs had openly confirmed they had written to Sir Graham demanding a confidence vote in her leadership.Mrs May will today use a speech at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference in central London to argue that her Brexit deal will deliver the key demands of millions of voters in the 2016 EU referendum for the country to regain control of borders, law making and billions of pounds of taxpayers\u0027 money a year.She is expected to say: \u0026ldquoWe now have an intense week of negotiations ahead of us in the run-up to the special European Council on Sunday.\u0026ldquoDuring that time I expect us to hammer out the full and final details of the framework that will underpin our future relationship and I am confident that we can strike a deal at the council that I can take back to the House of Commons.\u0026ldquoThe core elements of that deal are already in place.The Withdrawal Agreement has been agreed in full, subject of course to final agreement being reached on the future framework.End the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (Image: Becker \u0026amp Bredelullstein bild via Getty Images)\u0026ldquoThat Agreement is a good one for the UK. It fulfills the wishes of the British people as expressed in the 2016 referendum.I have always had a very clear sense of the outcomes I wanted to deliver for people in these negotiations - control over our borders, by bringing an end to free movement, once and for all control of our money, so we can decide for ourselves how to spend it, and can do so on priorities like our NHS control of our laws, by ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the United Kingdom and ensuring that our laws are made and enforced here in this country.Turning to migration, the Prime Minister will add: \u0026ldquoGetting back full control of our borders is an issue of great importance to the British people.The United Kingdom is a country that values the contribution that immigration has made to our society and economy over many years.End to free movement of people (Image: Leon NealGetty Images)\u0026ldquoAnd in the future, outside the EU, immigration will continue to make a positive contribution to our national life.\u0026ldquoBut the difference will be this: once we have left the EU, we will be fully in control of who comes here.\u0026ldquoIt will no longer be the case that EU nationals, regardless of the skills or experience they have to offer, can jump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi. Instead of a system based on where a person is from, we will have one that is built around the talents and skills a person has to offer.\u0026ldquoNot only will this deliver on the verdict of the referendum. It should lead to greater opportunity for young people in this country to access training and skilled employment.E-gates for visitors from the USA, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada (Image: Oli ScarffGetty Images)We want an immigration system for the future that everyone can have confidence in. Yes, a system that works for business.One that allows us to attract the brightest and the best from around the world, more streamlined application and entry processes.\u0026ldquoAnd we are already talking action in that regard, introducing e-gates for visitors from the USA, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.\u0026ldquoBut it also needs to command the confidence of the public by putting them in control of who comes to this country. That is what I am determined to deliver, and I look forward to working with you to achieve it.Theresa May will meet EU President Jean-Claude Juncker this week (Image: Roni RekomaaBloomberg via Getty Images)Mrs May came out fighting against her Tory critics in an interview on Sky News yesterday.She used the interview to warn that the Brexiteer attempt to topple her could backfire by undermining the country\u0027s departure from the EU.A change of leadership at this point isn\u0027t going to make the negotiations any easier and it isn\u0027t going to change the parliamentary arithmetic.What it will do is bring in a degree of uncertainty. That is uncertainty for people and their jobs.Theresa May is due to head to Brussels to meet EU leaders and discuss further her Brexit deal (Image: Jasper JuinenBloomberg via Getty Images)What it will do is mean that it is a risk that we delay the negotiations and that is a risk that Brexit gets delayed or frustrated, Mrs May said.She confirmed she will head to Brussels this week for talks with EU President Jean-Claude Juncker to finalise a draft declaration outlining the UK\u0027s future relationship with the bloc.Anticipating a critical week in the negotiations, she said: I will be going back to Brussels.The negotiating teams are working as we speak and obviously which day I go back to Brussels will partly be about how those negotiations go.Tory and Brexiteer: Jacob Rees-Mogg  (Image: Dan KitwoodGetty Images)I will be going back to Brussels, I will be in touch with other leaders as well, because the summit next week - and it is next week - this special European Council, will be among the European leaders.Mrs May also insisted she had not considered quitting after the backbench coup attempt led by Jacob Rees-Mogg was unleashed last week.Asked if she had considered stepping down, the Prime Minister said: No I haven\u0027t.

The report from the PACAC has called for urgent action and backs previous findings from the Burns report, which laid out proposals on reducing the size of the House of Lords. It argues the growing size of the Chamber is impacting on its ability to function as effectively as it should.                Peer demolishes second referendum bid with THIS point about 2016 vote                Tory peer TEARS into Barnier during heated Brexit debateConservative MP Sir Bernard said Westminster\u0026rsquos revising Chamber must not be allowed to grow \u0026ldquoexponentially and axing the 200 peers over the coming years was the \u0026ldquoobvious step.He said: The House of Lords is of vital importance to the UK\u0027s political system, carrying out important scrutiny and revising functions, but it is a problem that the size of the Chamber continues to grow exponentially.My Committee is calling for the number of peers to be reduced, and then capped, at 600, as recommended in the Burns report.This is an urgent window of opportunity and the Government and other party leaders must seize this moment of consensus to ensure the number of peers is reduced to 600 over the years ahead.Sir Bernard Jenkin wants the number of peers in the House of Lords capped at 600 (Image: )The committee of MPs have highlighted how the reduction rate proposed in the Burns report would take up to 11-years to implement.It has called for party leaders to agree to strict retirement targets in order to accelerate reaching the new target.MPs said a sharp fall in numbers could be achieved with a commitment from Prime Minister Theresa May following a \u0026ldquotwo-out-one-in policy.They have also called for a body to justify new appointments to the Chamber, which would be allocated to pparties based on their vote share in the most recent general election.Sir Bernard, the MP for Harwich and North Essex since the 2010 general election, has also laid out plans for a new 15-year term for newly-appointed peers.                Labour peer MOCKS organisers of second Brexit referendum marchMPs said the fall in peers could be achieved by Theresa May following a two-out-one-in policy (Image: )He said this was a \u0026ldquodesirable but not essential part of the recommended reform, but also described it as \u0026ldquoperhaps the most radical element of the scheme.The PACAC chairman added: \u0026ldquoThe introduction of 15-year term limits for new life peers is perhaps the most radical element of the scheme and it will immediately create two classes of peer with all existing peers remaining appointed for life, and all new peers for a fixed term.There are members of both Houses who have been highly effective parliamentarians for far longer than 15 years, and this fixed term could remove peers at the peak of their effectiveness.But Sir Bernard said the proposals outlined by the committee would just be \u0026ldquoa minimal incremental reform and \u0026ldquowill fall far short of the aspirations of many who wish to see abolition or an elected Upper House.Sir Bernard Jenkin said the proposals would just be a minimal incremental reform  (Image: )He concluded: Adopting this reform does, however, not remove the pressure for more fundamental reform of the second chamber.A spokesman for the Lord Speaker\u0026rsquos Committee said: We are pleased the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee have recognised the importance of the Burns committee recommendations to reduce the size of the House of Lords.We welcome their agreement that a capped membership of 600 is appropriate and new Members be appointed on a \u0027two-out, one-in\u0027 formula in line with general election results.In the first year since the Burns report was published, the House of Lords has met the recommended targets in reducing the size of the House but it is important that progress is maintained.

His concerns come as senior academics say a no deal scenario with the EU is now the best option available for the UK at this late stage.

There was real enthusiasm for a USUK trade deal but they were categorical that this would be impossible if the UK does not control its own tariff schedules or regulatory environment. That is exactly the fate which awaits us under the Prime Minister\u0027s current plans.Many British luxury brands are popular in the US with Rolls-Royce, which is made here, last year selling almost 2,000 cars, despite the lack of a trade deal. Clothing brands Next, Asos, Lipsy London, Rokit and Sweaty Betty also boast strong sales due to the UK\u0027s reputation for quality.Mr Paterson said that Mrs May should not simply stick to what she has secured from the EU.He added: Her best option is to change course and negotiate a wideranging, zero-tariff trade agreement, with solutions to the Northern Ireland border based on existing techniques and processes. Otherwise, she risks failing to honour the largest democratic mandate the British people have ever delivered.Meanwhile, Professor David Paton, chair of industrial economics at Nottingham University Business School, has said poorer voters in Labour heartlands have the most to gain from a no deal with the EU.Owen Paterson (Image: Victoria Jones PA ArchivePA Images)The senior member of Economists for Free Trade and a long-standing Labour member, has said Labour MPs should back Tory Brexiteers in pushing through a no deal if the PM\u0027s plans are voted down.Prof Paton pointed out: In the first place, we would no longer be forced to erect huge barriers to trade with non-EU countries, something which forces up the price of food and clothing for hard-pressed consumers. We would be free to strike deals with fast-growing economies around the world and, crucially, we would be able to control economic policy for the benefit of our own workers, consumers and businesses, rather than having to do what works for the EU Commission.He added: Why should we wait until 2022 before the UK is given gracious permission by the EU to abolish VAT on female sanitary products?Professor Gwythian Prins (Image: CH)On the Briefings for Brexit website of pro-Brexit academics, Professor Gwythian Prins has warned that the EU is rapidly collapsing - with economic problems around the euro, its southern economies such as Italy struggling and concerns over Eastern Europe.

We are already laying the groundwork for negotiations with the US, Australia and New Zealand, and we will set out our negotiating objectives before formal talks begin.Last month, the US Trade Representative notified Congress of the Administration\u0027s intention to start talks with the UK for an agreement once the UK has left on March 29.A DIT source confirmed: The US is getting ready to negotiate.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though.

He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too. This has been the real problem with our economy.But it looks like we’re on the right track.UH-OH – the Beast from the East is said to be on its way back.You remember late last winter.

She makes £k a year by whispering to people over the internet.Usually stuff like: “Hello sweetheart.”She says it stimulates the listener’s “autonomous sensory meridian response”.Which is perhaps the longest phrase for “penis” I have ever heard.MONICA LEWIN­SKY was the young intern who had an affair with President Clinton, back in the s.Come on – you remember. According to reports a cigar was involved.And Monica had a revealing stain on the front of her dress.She’s been talking about the whole episode again.And she says she thought the stuff on her dress was “spinach dip”.Really  If it looked like spinach dip I think Bill should have got himself off to a doctor, pronto.Are you sure it wasn’t cock-a-leekie ASIA BIBI is the Pakistani Christian woman who was sentenced to death for alleged “blasphemy” against the Prophet Muhammad.She then had her sentence commuted and some Pakistani Muslims are going bonkers, as usual.Demanding she have her head cut off.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the s, Ted Heath and Harold Wilson both knew we would baulk at belonging to a Common Market that robbed us of our national independence.So they hid its true purpose — “ever closer union”, leading to a superstate with one currency. The public was reassured our sovereignty would not be surrendered to any meaningful degree.The Tory and Labour leaders both knew this was a lie. But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start. And the pattern was set.In  John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, without risking the public vote that saw it initially rejected by the Danes and Irish.In  Tony Blair — who now shamelessly praises fork-tongued civil ­servants for hoodwinking eurosceptic ministers — feared he would lose a referendum on handing new powers to the EU. So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July. It is crucial to the reclaiming of our sovereignty which a .million majority including many Sun readers, voted for in .It is crucial to our post-Brexit prosperity. It looks crucial, too, to whether the deal lives or dies. Yet, knowing exactly what the EU intends for us, the PM still brazenly insisted yesterday that we WILL make our own trade deals.How, Mrs May  We cannot.

Why  Why are they keeping going  Why “Why is one family getting all this priority  There are , missing people in this country.”In a separate case Karen Downes, , said she felt “very angry” other children, including her daughter Charlene, were “simply being forgotten”.She told the Sun Online: “A child goes missing in the UK every three minutes. What about all those others who never come home again ”No trace has been found of Charlene, , since she was last seen in Blackpool on November ,  – despite huge publicity and a £, reward.Last year detectives finally released the only CCTV footage of her on the day she vanished - after it lay unnoticed on police shelves for  years.Two takeaway workers were acquitted of her murder in  after a trial heard her body was chopped up and had gone into kebabs.Karen added: If they are going to plough money into the search for Madeleine, then they should do the same for all the children who are missing.She didn’t even go missing in this country – it’s really a matter for the Portuguese police, and yet the money just keeps on rolling in for the search.”Ben Needham’s mum, Kerry, has previously criticised the cash given to the Maddie search, saying it “hurt her”.She said: As Bens mum Im not taking anything away from them. We havent had a fraction of that help.Operation Grange has been one of the longest, most high-profile and costly police investigations in history.Some  persons of interest have been examined and sightings of Madeleine — in Brazil, India, Morocco and Paraguay, on a German plane and in a New Zealand supermarket — assessed.Previously police confirmed they thought Maddie was snatched by a paedophile gang who may have smuggled her over the border or grabbed during a botched burglary at the holiday complex.They have also been keen to identy a woman in purple seen hanging around the holiday flat.The Portuguese investigation of Madeleines disappearance was criticised by the British authorities as being not fit for purpose.Scotland Yard began an investigative review into the disappearance in , on the orders of then-Prime Minister David Cameron.Not one piece of forensic evidence linked to the little girl has been found since she vanished.And despite trawling through thousands of tip-offs and potential sightings, police have not confirmed that a single one was her.A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed: “We have confirmed that Special Grant funding of £, will be provided to the politan Police Service for the six-month period to  March . This is an ongoing police investigation.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004495554113.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"esther mcvey cabinet meltdown brexit deal","story":"The ex-Pensions Secretary reportedly became hysterical as she slammed Theresa Mays Brexit plan.Ms McVey today denied that she lost her temper - and described Cabinet colleagues as feeble for getting alarmed by her behaviour.The MP for Tatton resigned on Thursday morning, slamming the PM over the proposed withdrawal agreement.During the crunch Cabinet meeting the day before, Ms McVey was the angriest minister - urging Mrs May to let those present take a formal vote on whether or not they back the deal.One Cabinet source told the Mail on Sunday: It was the most extraordinary meltdown Ive seen in Cabinet.I thought security would have to be called, because she seemed so hysterical and aggressive.Chief Whip Julian Smith ended up shouting at her to shut up, the minister added.Ms McVey today described the claims as hilarious and mocked ministers for overreacting.She said: Seems a bit of straight talking from me to ask Cabinet members to vote on the most important matter in a letime made them crumble!Makes you wonderthis is how feeble senior members have been in negotiations with the EU over our future After she demanded a vote on the deal, Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill - Britains top civil servant - produced documents showing that a formal vote is impossible.Ms McVey was one of two Cabinet ministers to resign on Thursday, triggering a massive crisis for Mrs May.The PM is now fighting off an attempt to call a vote of no confidence in her leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"italy earthquake ravenna venice magnitude latest","story":"An estimated .million people have felt the tremors.The earthquake struck about  kilometres from the town of Ravenna.Witnesses and residents say they heard a roar and that furniture moved.One wrote to EMSC and said: I heard a roar.Another said: Very short and intense.One said: Just two seconds of trembling, lamps moving a minute and chair moved.Another added: For about  seconds the TV set and hanging lamp were visibly shaking, I was sitting on couch and could feel shaking like strongwaves.A . earthquake on the Ritcher scale is classied as a light earthquake.It is felt by most people and objects do move and fall as well as light sleepers will be woken up.Signicant damage is unlikely.The EMSC  is an independent organisation that provides real-time earthquake information.For the latest news on this story keep checking back at Sun Online, where we will bring you live updates as soon as they happen, before anyone .Like us on Facebook at www.facebook thesun, and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSun, where we will bring you this story and all the rest of the top news and exclusives of the day.TheSun is your go to destination for the best celebrity news, football news, real-le stories, jaw-dropping pictures and must-see videoOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She told me, you know, ‘Make a web page, make sure you set up the details correctly, know what you’re looking for.’”Payton copied the layout and much of the text from the other woman’s website.One section reads: “I don’t care about the age or the appearance of a man.“I admire respectful and intelligent men. Men who take care of women, give compliments and know what they want. I will be waiting for you to take my innocence.”It also lists a series of rules for the process, stating that “documents of my virginity will be provided by local health authorities”, the buyer “also has the further possibility to check me up again with a doctor he trusts” and “we will spend  hours together at the hotel where the winner is staying”.Payton said she didn’t want to ask her parents, who are originally from South America, for any financial help and would “probably” never tell them.She said: “I think they would think it’s kind of stupid, I don’t think they would get angry, they would just ask me why I would do something like that.“I guess I’d lie . I would just say I got a job.”Dr Lauren Rosewarne, senior social scientist at the University of Melbourne and author of Intimacy on the Internet, said she didn’t see it as “either positive or negative”.She said: “At the end of the day it’s up to a woman how she uses her body, andshe wants to profit from selling access to her virginity that’s her choice.“I do think it says something about our culture that the quickest way for a woman to earn , upwards is to do this.“Just be careful."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000347956192.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mirror possessed ghost titanic captain for sale","story":"The -year-old antique is believed to be possessed by the ghost of Edward John Smith - who left it on his dressing table before setting sail on the ill-fated ocean liners maiden voyage.His servant Ethelwynne took it from his home in lieu of wages after the ship was sunk by an iceberg on  April, .The terried maid claimed she could see the Captains face appear in it every year on the anniversary of the Titanics sinking.It was passed down by her relatives before being abandoned in Wolverhampton and picked up by current owner David Smith - who kept it locked in a vault for five years.Included with the mirror is a small brown envelope containing a handwritten note about the mirrors past.Ethelwynnes sister-in-law wrote to a pal: She always spooked me when she said that at times she could still see Captain Smith’s face in it on the anniversary of when the Titanic was sunk.Auctioneer Richard Winterton said: “The last time Captain Edward John Smith saw his own noble, bearded visage before leaving home to take the helm of the Titanic was possibly in this very mirror.“Even with one’s feet firmly on land and in the sunshine of a clear afternoon, there is something otherworldly about seeing your own reflection in such an object.“Captain Smith must have surveyed his own image in this mirror countless times and the legend that his face can still be seen in it on each anniversary of the Titanic’s sinking is as compelling as it is chilling!Whoever buys this in December will have it in good time to test that legend for themselves on the th anniversary next April.”The mirror is expected to fetch more than £, when it goes up for auction in Lichfield, Staffs.Dickinson’s Real Deal star Richard Winterton said: Interest in the Titanic is as strong as ever.

They want Britain to have a unilateral way out of the Irish backstop plan that could keep the UK in the customs union for many years otherwise.Allies of Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom say they could both quit by the end of the week unless Mrs May relents. But dfering tactics emerged among the rebel Cabinet group last night.Michael Gove has told friends he won’t now resign eventhe PM refuses ALL the Pizza Club’s demands. The Environment Secretary also thinks they have a greater chance of talking Mrs May out of agreeing a “single customs territory” with the EU as part of a joint vision for a future trade deal.Brexiteers fear the new phrase - in the far shorter Political Declaration that will accompany the orce deal - will spell an end to any hope of controlling our own trade deals where, and could be even worse than her Chequers plan for a soft Brexit.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Transport supremo Chris Grayling are also expected to sit tight now. The Pizza Club will try to meet today to draw up a plan of action, but by late last night no time had been set for the get together because of clashing diaries.One former Brexiteer minister, who has already resigned, told The Sun: “The only way to make your case heard by the PM is to put your job on the line. Dominic Raab and Esther McVey did that, but the others haven’t had the balls to yet and probably now won’t, so whatever they ask for is futile.”To the dismay of Brexiteers yesterday, Mrs May argued that the backstop plan to ensure the Irish border stays open wouldn’t workeither side could pull out of it.The PM told Sky News: “Just think aboutyou took out an insurance policy, andyou were coming up to the point where that insurance policy was being used, and suddenly people pull the plug on it for you  What would you think ”She added: “We agreed the withdrawal agreement in principle last week. The focus this week will be on the future relationship”.The PM also revealed she will fly to Brussels mid-week ahead of the summit to press the case personally for her vision of a future trade deal, pledging “an intense week” ahead. The draft Political Declaration that sets a course for the future relationship published last week was just seven pages long, as opposed to the orce deal’s  pages.But Mrs May also revealed she hopes she will be able to persuade round Brexiteer doubters by painting in a more complete vision. The PM argued: “It’s the future relationship that actually delivers on people’s concerns in the withdrawal agreement”.She also warned coup plotters who want to replace her as Tory leader to think again, saying: “It is not going to make the negotiations any easier, and it won’t change the Parliamentary arithmetic”.While admitting it has been “a tough week”, askedshe had considered stepping down, Mrs May said: “No, I haven’t”.The PM will mount a fresh bid today to sell her deal by saying it will halt EU migrants from being able to “jump the queue” to get into Britain. She will tell the CBI’s annual conference this morning: “Getting back full control of our borders is an issue of great importance to the British people”.Writing for The Sun online today, former Cabinet minister Priti Patel says of the current future trade deal blueprint: “The EU is tightening its grip on us and we get nothing – certainly no trade deal - in . This agreement effectively means that the EU has taken back control.”The DUP also called on the PM to renegotiate the backstop last night, arguing it splits Northern Ireland from the EU. Its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said: “It is clear that it is time to work for a better deal which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will again rule out voting for Mrs May’s deal next month unless she deepens customs ties with the EU. In his own speech to the CBI, the Opposition boss say he would negotiate “a new comprehensive and permanent customs union”The Tories’ sticking plaster plan for a temporary customs arrangement, with no clarity on how long it will last and no British say, can only prolong the uncertainty and put jobs and prosperity at risk.Two opinion polls yesterday revealed Labour has opened up a three point lead over the Tories after days of party turmoil over Brexit. As the Conservatives descended again into a full blown civil war, an Opinium poll for the Observer found the Tories have dropped five points to % while Labour has gained three to stand on %.And a ComRes poll for the Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror showed Labour on % versus versus the Conservatives on %.Alongside her woeful and deeply unpopular -page withdrawal agreement was a much sketchier seven-page political declaration that outlined ambitions for our future trading relationship with the EU. It said very little.Before negotiations formally start, it is vital Mrs May gets a lot more from the EU. Without doing so, she almost certainly won’t get the numbers to pass her Commons vote.Despite Mrs May’s stark failings, the Tories must also avoid imploding.A leadership battle will be bloody and even Tory Brexiteers are split. Dominic Raab, who resigned last week as Brexit minister, yesterday admitted he would back Mrs Maythere was a vote of no confidence... What does thatsay about the viability of a coup And voters, already irritated by Tory squabbling, will punish themthey are dragged to the polls yet again.The terrying prospect of Jeremy Corbyn in No, with all the damage Britain’s first Marxist PM could unleash, should be enough to stop the Tories from tearing themselves apart.To unite her party, the PM must start showing some energy, zeal and optimism about Britain.Our future, and hers, depends on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Michel Barnier is said to have proposed the extension in order to give more time for Britain to strike a full trade deal with the EU. The move would also give diplomats more time to find a means of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland and avoid the use of the backstop. Under the draft Withdrawal Agreement published last week, the transition period would begin when the UK leaves the EU on March  and run until December  .  During the transition, EU law will continue to apply in the UK and Britain will continue to participate in the customs union and the single market. There is a one-off option for the UK to seek an extension of the transitionnegotiations on the future relationship are still continuing. According to the Financial Times, Mr Barnier told EU ambassadors in a diplomatic note that the transition period could be extended until as late as December .  During the extended period, the UK could have to continue to allow the free movement of people from the EU and keep making large payments to Brussels.In October, Theresa May confirmed she was ready to consider a delay of a matter of months in Britains final departure from the EU in order to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The Prime Minister previously said she did not expect any extension of the transition period to be needed, because she hoped to conclude a deal on the UKs future trade and security relationship with the EU by its scheduled end-date of December . In his reported communique, Mr Barnier is said to have noted that the political situation in Westminster is volatile.

The inequality, austerity and neglect that drove so many to vote for Brexit isn’t dealt with at all in this deal. That is why Labour is opposed to the Government’s Brexit agreement and is determined we achieve a better deal for Britain’s workers and our country. We have set out an alternative plan for a sensible jobs-first Brexit. The Prime Minister’s deal leaves Britain’s businesses and workers in an even more uncertain state. Labour would negotiate a permanent customs union with a UK say on future trade deals, which all but the hard-right privatisers think is necessary for our economy.  While claiming to take back control, the Government’s “backstop” risks locking Britain into an indefinite halfway house it cannot leave without the agreement of the EU. This is an unparalleled and unacceptable loss of sovereignty, which Labour will not accept on behalf of our country. Labour would negotiate a deal that guarantees our country does not fall behind the EU on workers’ rights, or protections for consumers and the environment. We won’t let this Government use Brexit as an excuse for a race to the bottom in protections and to rip up rights at work, or expose our children to chlorinated chicken by running down standards. We would also seek a sensible deal that guarantees a strong single market relationship. A downgraded Canada-style deal is popular only on the extremes of the Tory party. It would be a risk to our economy, jobs and public services. A good plan must also include a radical programme of investment and change. Theresa May must now go back to Brussels and negotiate a better deal. If she can’t or won’t do that, she must stand aside and let Labour negotiate a deal which works for the whole country and offers the stability and fairness people are crying out for.

Surrendering sovereignty to minimise economic damage is May’s cowardly compromise. A braver PM would denounce forcefully the cost-free easy Britannia bonanza fabricated by fibbers Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, then champion another referendum. The uncomfortable home truths about stockpiling medicines and food as well as troops on the streets put into perspective the Leavers’ mythical poundmillion a week saving promise on the side of a bus. Timid Theresa May doesn’t come clean because she’s afraid of insulting five Cabinet Brextremists organising against her including Michael Gove and a Liam Fox suddenly believing any deal’s better than no deal.  She might survive a no-confidence vote of Conservative MPs in the coming weeks. But May is not strong and stable. She is living to die another day and her botched plan is barely worth the name. So a sovereign Parliament gains a glorious opportunity to take back control next month. Jeremy Corbyn’s immediate task is to convince his Westminster waverers the choice isn’t May’s mess or accidentally crashing out of Europe without a leline.

But he said thathe had received the  letters required to trigger the vote, he would have told the Prime Minister. He said: Indeed, the rules are very clear,the threshold were to be reached I would have to consult with the leader of the party – the Prime Minister. Askedthis would happen immediately, he added: Well I think that the whole thing is written with the intention that it should be an expeditious process. I think one of the crazy things that has taken hold over the last few weeks is that people in the media and where are suggesting that this could be something that goes on for weeks, and it’s an entirely discretionary process for me. It’s not. The intention is clear thatit were to happen, it ought to be a test of opinion, very quickly, in order to clear the air and get it out of the way so that the party, the government at the moment, can move on. And he said the idea that he would sit on some letters to give the PM or the party, a moment to draw breath was untrue and offensive.

But it ended in a sickening story of violence and death deep in the South American jungle. A cult leader who once preached peace and equality and railed against the violence of the global nuclear arms race now urged his followers towards death. Jim Jones was found shot in the head lying among the bodies of  followers - including women and babies. The mass suicide on th November  was the largest ever single loss of American civilian le in a deliberate act, and remained so until the   terror attacks.  Followers of Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, better known as Jonestown, had committed mass suicide. Earlier other cult members had butchered congressman Leo Ryan, in an act that Jones ordered, after he arrived in north Guyana to investigate claims people had been held against their will. He had met disciples who begged for his help amid lack of food and a dictatorship regime. Jones feared he was about to be exposed and so ordered Ryans death, with several of his entourage also killed. The cult leader then set in motion the plans for mass suicide he had long anticipated. He called his adopted son, also called Jim, at the cult HQ in Georgetown, the largest nearby city, and gave him an order with a terrying secret meaning.  In a new documentary he recalls: In the early evening I went down to the radio room because my father wanted to talk to me. He says, Were going to meet Mr. Fraser. And that was code for committing revolutionary suicide, and you need to work out how you guys can meet Mr. Fraser in Georgetown. Im like, What the hell is going on, is there something  we can do  Then my father went into a rhetoric: This is the cause that you have to stand up to, our avenging angels will protect us, and prove things right or make justice happen, but we have to meet Mr. Fraser. Terried about what was happening, Jim and his brothers went to the American Embassy to raise the alarm - but it was already too late. Back at the camp Jones had called a large meeting at the towns pavilion using the speaker system he often gave propaganda laden speeches over. Deadly cocktail Meanwhile a cocktail of sedatives and cyanide had been mixed by -year-old camp doctor Lawrence Schacht and flavoured with powdered grape juice flavouring. The phrase Drinking the Kool-Aid was later born from the Jonestown suicides to mean a person or group who goes along with a doomed or dangerous idea because of peer pressure. The assembled were told it was time to die. The first to take the poison were Ruletta Paul and her one-year-old son Robert. A syringe with its needle removed was used to squirt poison into the infants mouth, after which Paul squirted another syringe into her own mouth. Jones ordered mothers with babies to take the poison first and its been speculated that it was to make adults more willing to die after their children were dead.  One eye-witness stated that while the poison was squirted in some childrens mouths, there was no panic or emotional outburst and the assembled Temple members looked like they were in a trance. This though was contradicted when a  minute audio recording - known as the death tape - emerged revealing cries and screams of children. On the tape Jones could be heard ranting: I tell you, I dont care how many screams you hear, I dont care how many anguished cries...death is a million times preferable to  more days of this le. If you knew what was ahead of you –you knew what was ahead of you, youd be glad to be stepping over tonight. Humble beginnings The cult leader had begun as an American evangelical preacher who was certain the Cold War of the s would bring a nuclear bomb. He created a community in San Francisco, Calornia, where he said his followers would be safe from nuclear fallout. Many of his followers were recovering drug addicts from the black community and he seemed to offer a warm welcome at a time when racial ides were strong. But the authorities started to pay extra interest to his community - called the Peoples Temple - and there were stories in the press from disaffected former members of the church. Then almost overnight Jones relocated to Guyana, in South America. Followers - to whom he preached about communism, socialism, the US government, the rich, economic equality and ending childhood hunger- believed he had special powers and followed him to the new planned utopia  One member of the cult who survived the massacre with his children, Jerry Parks, recalled a car journey when what he thought at the time was a miracle happened. He said: My son Dale was driving to school with Jim Jones with two or three cars. The lead car which he was in hit a duck and knocked it to the side of the highway. Jim had him pull over, open the door, got out, walked over and picked the duck up in his hand and Dale says he stroked the duck. Miracle He said he was saying something but he didnt understand what he was saying and all of a sudden the duck jumps up to his feet on the hand and flies away. That is something to this day we dont understand how to view it, what to think about it, was it real, was the duck alive, would it have happened anyway  We didnt think that way at the time, because it was too early on with Jim Jones so we believed that it was the real thing. Jerry says now that he never fully bought into Jones hyperbole and suspected disaster was on the horizon the moment he landed in South America.  He said: I knew early on that we were going to die over there. He had backed himself into a corner that he couldnt get out of and it would soon fall in on him. He said we may have to die for this. But he didnt mean were going to grab guns and stand out there and protect ourselves. You have to die for it means were gonna kill ourselves before they get us. New start In South America in the baking heat Jones and his followers built a town housing , - mainly women and children. But it was not to be a peaceful le as quickly his methods of controlling a community containing those who had begun to doubt their mission became increasingly cruel and driven by paranoia. Residents had their passports collected on arrival and any dissent was treated with brutal beatings or menial tasks as punishment. Members of the cult were forced to sign confessions to theft, abuse and terrorism as a sign of loyalty but in reality they were used to keep the members quiet. Former member Joyce Shaw told the Mirror in  that Jones imposed celibacy on members, telling them he was the only heterosexual in the world but slept with both men and women. Shaw, who had been a member in the US, said: I saw beatings and physical abuse. For discipline people were publicly spanked or beaten with thick sticks. A man who confessed to being a homosexual was stripped, beaten with a rubber hose and made to march around to show his welts.  You could see that he could no longer have ed as a man. Another man who complained about the celibacy rule was forced to perform humiliating acts in public with a woman who vomited over him. That cured his ardour. Little kids who misbehaved had to box each other, so did elderly people. Word began to leak back to the USA that some residents were being held against their will in the community - which was known as Jonestown - and relatives lobbied their elected representatives for help. Paranoia Jones believed the American Government had it in for him and was terried he would lose control, so he ordered his brainwashed followers to conduct drills in preparation for a mass suicide. Then, in November , Congressman Leo Ryan decided to visit the community after his interest became aroused when the son of a friend who was a member of the cult was found murdered days after saying he wanted to leave. It was to begin the ball rolling towards a tragic conclusion. By the time Ryan arrived on November , Jones health had declined, according to survivors, and he was abusing LSD, Quaaludes, stimulants and barbiturates. His once sharp speaking voice was slurred, his eyes were glazed and he was increasingly paranoid. Ambush Ryan was initially refused entry to the town but once inside he was treated to a well-rehearsed musical show designed to show all was happy and well. In fact it would later emerge he had told an aide that he planned to report all was well upon histo the US. Jones, though, had already decided on his deadly course. Inside the camp several unhappy families approached Ryan asking to come with him when he left, but the numbers were still small in relation to the overall population. On the evening of November  the departing Ryan party - along with  defectors - assembled at the nearby Port Kaituma airstrip to fly back to Georgetown. They had been joined by Temple loyalist Larry Layton despite the concerns of those leaving who did not trust him.  As the party waited at the airstrip a tractor and trailer appeared and hidden gunmen opened fire - Congressman Ryan, two reporters and an NBC cameraman were killed along with defector Patricia Parks, while several other people were also injured. Congressman Ryan was shot more than  times. Jerry Parks was at the airstrip when the shooting happened and recalls in a new Investigation: Discover documentary: I had just fastened my seatbelt and was siting right by the window and I heard the guns going off and the bullets flying and all I could think to say was my God! I heard my mom holler look at Patty, my we. I looked back and she was sat slumped over with the top of her head gone. Larry Layton had shot two people inside the plane but when he tried to shoot Jerrys son Dale, the gun jammed. The gunmen fled after killing the Congressman and the survivors hid in the jungle until help arrived.  Back at the camp Jones used news of Ryans death to speed up the mass suicide telling his followers: The Congressman’s dead … please get us some medication. It’s simple, it’s simple, there’s no convulsions with it, it’s just simple, just please get it before it’s too late. The GDFwill be here. I tell you get moving, get moving, get moving … The poison took just five minutes to kill. When the army arrived they found a scene of unimaginable devastation with bodies littering the ground around the pavilion. A handful of cult members survived by fleeing into the jungle or hiding. Grover Davis, , who was partly deaf, missed the announcement to assemble on the loudspeaker, lay down in a ditch, and pretended to be dead. The children A first body count put the death toll at . Only when the bodies were moved was it discovered that children and babies had been murdered and their bodies lay hidden beneath the adult corpses. Plastic cups, Flavor Aid packets, and syringes, some with needles and some without, littered the area where the bodies were found. Jones body was found with a self inflicted gunshot to the head. At the cults headquarters in Georgetown, cult member Sharon Amos cut the throats of two of her own children and then killed herself.

Police in the Operation Grange team have told Kate and Gerry McCann they are hopeful for a result. Detectives told Kate and Gerry during a meeting - thought to be at their Leicestershire home - that they had two specic and active lines of inquiry, according to the Daily Mail. Kate and Gerry are said to be greatly encouraged that Scotland Yard could finally be closing in on Maddies kidnapper eleven-and-a-half years after she vanished while the family was on holiday in Portugal. Last week the Home Office announced it would grant an extra pound, to Operation Grange to keep the investigation going until spring next year. A Whitehall source reportedly said: politan Police officers had a sit-down meeting with Madeleines parents to tell them exactly where they were with their inquiries.  They informed them they had two specic and active leads that still needed to be chased and that although the investigation was taking longer than they initially thought officers said they were confident and hopeful they could get a result. Maddie, three, vanished from a holiday apartment in Portugals Praia da Luz in May . She had been left alone sleeping with her younger twin siblings while her parents were dining in a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. Police advised the McCanns there was still important work left to be done as they requested extra funding, allaying the familys fears that the London forces seven-and-a-half year investigation could be shelved. Kate and Gerry still cling onto hope that Maddie, who would now be , could still be alive even after all this time.  The McCanns spokesperson Clarence Mitchell said the couple were incredibly grateful for the approved extra funding. He said: They are greatly encouraged that the Met Police still believe there is work left to be done in the search for their daughter and they remain incredibly grateful to the Home Office for providing an extra budget for the investigation. It is a boostthe whole family and gives them renewed hope that one day they may finally find out what happened to Madeleine. Mr Mitchell added: Kate and Gerry appreciate everything the authorities have done and are doing to get a resolution after all this time. Beyond this they cannot comment on the ongoing operation.  The extra cash will enable Operation Grange to keep going until the end of March next year. A spokesperson for Scotland Yard said: We have confirmed that Special Grant funding of pound, will be provided to the politan Police Service for the six-month period to  March . This is an ongoing police investigation. The British inquiry was launched in May  after an initial bungled Portuguese investigation and the McCanns own funded private eye searches, is spearheaded by Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall.

Jessica, whose named has been changed by police keep her anonymous, was caught out by a scam known as ‘romance fraud.’ Police describe the victim from Staffordshire as a woman living a comfortable existence including a nice house and car. However, Stoke-On-Trent Live reports that her le was turned upside down after she fell for a scam. In  Jessica began playing the Scrabble app ‘Words with Friends’ where she would often talk to strangers and make online friends. However in June this year a stranger challenged her to a game, which led to him seducing her and conning her out of thousands of pounds. Jessica said: He told me he lived in San Jose, Calornia. His father was from the USA and his mother from Malta. The pictures he sent indicated that he was a very good looking man. “He told me he had orced his we and lost their two children in a car accident three years ago.” After a short period of time the conversation moved onto the Google Hangouts app, where over a number of weeks the fraudster claimed he was a millionaire, making his money as an oil rig contractor. As they got to know each other better their relationship intensied, with the fraudster telling Jessica he loved her and sending her red roses. Jessica received a number of photos and videos, including pictures of expensive flight tickets, to try and prove the lavish lestyle he could apparently offer. The ongoing relationship gave Jessica a happiness she had not known for a long time, which unfortunately led her to make some rash financial decisions. I told him I wanted to book a cruise because I was feeling so much better thanks to him. He told me not to book it until we met up, but I couldnt resist it and booked a ticket for me and him, she said. This was when the scamming really started. He begged me to allow him to pay for the cruise, I refused and told him, pay me back when you see me. “He made me feel guilty for calling him a liar and not caring, because I wouldnt accept his gratitude. So he tried to send me the money, and then he shared pictures claiming that all his .m fortune was now frozen following a trip overseas.  I challenged the fact that a jet-setting millionaires bank account would be frozen as he is always travelling abroad, but he was very manipulative and made me feel uncaring. “The conversation quickly turned and before I knew it I had agreed to send him pound, to cover necessities like food and medical supplies. “He said he had  staff underneath him that he needed to provide for and so two days later he convinced me to send a further pound,. Unfortunately the fraudster did not stop there, contacting Jessica in another two or three days and asking for an additional pound, as he had a problem at one of his oil rigs and needed money to fly over a specialist from Turkey. By this time Jessica had run out of money and so her bank froze her account and said they suspected she had become victim to a scam. I struggled for  days on limited money and then luckily I managed to get some cash out to see me through, she said. I was visiting the bank daily, begging them to unfreeze my accounts as I had bills to pay. I was too ashamed to ask any friends or family for help, they wouldnt believe that I would be so stupid to give my hard-earned money to a stranger. The scam was reported to Staffordshire Police and detectives met with Jessica to talk through her options and provide some reassurance. The detective was able to demonstrate that the photo of the man she thought she was talking to was actually taken from a social media profile of a random man in Norway. In reality her relationship was with a group of fraudsters who were most likely performing the same scam to a number of victims at any one time. When asked how she felt when she realised it was a scam, Jessica said: To be honest, I just felt stupid. That money was there for a rainy day and retirement so that I could go and enjoy myself. “But, its gone now, never to be seen again. The only positive is that Im a stronger person for it and now more aware of how easily people can be manipulated into something they want to believe is true.

The -year-old Duchess of Sussex - branded Hurricane Meghan by royal aides because of her work ethic - has reportedly raised eyebrows with her choice of outfits since her wedding. Although she is said to have a good relationship with the Queen, her dress sense hasnt always been met with approval. According to the Mail on Sunday, the monarch was surprised when Meghan opted to wear the elegant white Givenchy dress for her May wedding, given she had been married before. And her decision not to wear a hat on a royal visit alongside the Queen in Cheshire in June raised eyebrows - because protocol dictates she should have followed suit when told the monarch would don one.  This is said to have caused a level of tension between the two on the trip, as the Queen is described as a stickler for the rules. A fashion team source said: Meghan is being told she needs to start dressing less like a Hollywood star and more like a Royal. In her first royal engagement after getting married on May , many commented on how she appeared to have altered her style to be more fitting with the royals . But just a few months later she was back to her more usual style - showing bare legs in shorter styles, not entirely keeping with royal protol.  She wore a black suit, with the skirt above the knee, when she attended a special performance of the musical Hamilton in August. And her fondness for wearing black may not be entirely popular, as royals traditionally only wear the colour when in mourning. She is also a fan of non-British designers, which suggests she is breaking the mould. According to a royal source Meghan is up at am rain or shine and her formidable work ethic is like something that palace staff have never experienced before.

Donna Corden can finally now bring herself to look in the mirror again after a minor fall in her home ended up with her looking like ‘Frankensteins monster’. Mum-of-four Donna, , who suffers from arthritis, fell in her kitchen and cut her brow bone on the oven as she fell. Initially, she thought nothing of the scratch but just  hours after the accident, in January last year, she became incredibly sick. Daughter Jayde Stammers, , dialled  and Donna was raced to hospital.  Her skin turned black, her kidneys failed and she stopped breathing. Doctors diagnosed that the rare, deadly and aggressive bacteria, necrotising fasciitis, was devouring her flesh and heading straight towards her brain. In a desperate bid to save her le, surgeons cut out the aggressive bacteria and dead tissue over three hours, leaving Donna with only half her face. She spent four days in a coma fighting for her le before having an -hour surgery in which her thigh was sliced off and transplanted onto her hollowed-out face.  Donna said that when she woke from a coma she looked like a monster. She said: I asked to see my face so a nurse passed me a little hand-held mirror. I was sedated and the intensive care ward was quite dark which was lucky really because the transplant was hideous. I looked like Frankensteins monster. I was like something youd see at Halloween with this great big distorted head. They had to take the biggest piece of thigh flesh possible so they could then de-bulk it in stages.  I felt like a freak, which is a terrible thing to say about anyone with a disfigurement but its how I felt and still feel sometimes. Half my face had gone, I had a big patch over my eye and this rugby ball of flesh attached to my face. I thought I can never go out again. I gave the nurse back the mirror and cried.  I avoided mirrors after that but sometimes Id look out the hospital ward window and see my reflection which was hard. “There’s a mirror in my bedroom at home that I used to pamper myself and do my make-up at but when I came home from hospital I hung clothes over it so I didn’t have to see my reflection. “I stopped wearing make-up and put on weight.”  Donna was so anxious about the way she looked she became a ‘recluse’ only leaving the house for vital hospital appoitnments. She said: “ I could never show my face again. I got too anxious and lost all my confidence. Surgeons have been excavating Donna’s face from the transplanted thigh since her first surgery in a process known as de-bulking where they remove excess fatty tissue.  Their amazing skills has finally allowed Donna to start getting her le back together with her even joking: Ill probably look  years younger by the end of it all”. Speaking about the results, Donna said: “My face has gone down by half. When you look back at pictures you realise how far youve come. Doctors say its a miracle Im still here after what I went through. Necrotising fasciitis is extremely rare and it moves really fast, destroying tissue at cm an hour, so I was extremely lucky a doctor was there who recognised it.  “I was told thatI had been five minutes later to surgery it would have reached my organs and I would have died. My daughter begged the surgeons to save my eye, but they told her that it wasnt about saving my eye, it was about saving my le. My chances of surviving were very, very slim. It was an absolute nightmare but Ive definitely been through the worst part. You have to be able to laugh and to remember that there are people worse off than you. Donna is now running out of surgical options through the NHS and will soon be forced to turn to expensive cosmetic treatment to further de-bulk and re-build her face.  But the private treatment she now needs will cost at least pound,. You can donate to Donnas fund here. Donna’s friend, Lindsey Macenroe started a fundraising campaign to find the cash she needs to repair her face. Ms Macenroe also treated her for free with laser therapy at her True You Skin Clinic in Leeds and referred her to Irish cosmetic doctor, Dr Patrick Tracey, who has also offered treatment free-of-charge. “My surgeon told me thatthey cut away any more fat now there is a high risk of infection and of my body rejecting the transplant. They were going to focus on rebuilding my eye with skin grafts - I still have no eyelid - but my surgeon just told me on Thursday that that is too risky now too.  “So, now, most of the work I can have will need to be paid for privately and it’s expensive. The flesh and skin they transplanted from the top of my thigh to my face is a dferent tissue, its not anatomically supposed to be on the face, so its a dferent colour and it droops down, it doesnt hold in place. A surgeon in London said he can do metal work around my eyeball and cheekbone, like scaffolding, to build my face again and I can get the skin graft on my face tattooed the same colour as my facial skin but its all very expensive.” “It’s been a tough few years but my family have been brilliant. There’s no point in crying. I’m very lucky to be alive.” "},{"url":null,"title":"organised mum shares top housekeeping","story":"NewsThe Organised Mum shares top housekeeping tips for chore free weekendsManchester mum Gemma Bray has amassed thousands of online followers after creating The Organised Mum MethodShareCommentsByEmma GillPippa Allen-Kinross:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video secrets-of-the-organised-mum-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum of threes housekeeping tips are followed by thousands, after she created The Organised Mum Method to keep weekends free of any chores. Gemma Bray, , goes by the name The Organised Mum and has devised a method for getting all the cleaning done in half an hour a day between Monday and Friday. After making a rota for herself to help her keep on top of the housework when she had her first child  years ago, The Organised Mum Methodis now religiously followed by parents across the country. Gemma was even invited onto Good Morning Britain to talk about it. Gemma, who is now a mum of three, told the Manchester Evening News : I started the method  years ago after my eldest child was born. I was struggling to keep on top of everything in the house and look after a newborn, so I created the method which enabled me to get everything done but still have lots of time leftover to enjoy my new baby.I sat at my kitchen table and drew it up on a piece of paper and stuck it to my fridge, and I have followed it ever since. Essentially, TOMM is an efficient way to keep on top of everything at home. We work in  minute chunks daily Monday to Friday. Weekends are kept housework free so you can enjoy your time off without having to do a mammoth clean at the weekend. Each day has its own focus room, and these never change.The pattern goes: Monday - living room Tuesday - bedrooms Wednesday - hallway and stairs Thurs - kitchen Fridays - focusing on a dferent area each week in an eight-week cycleThe Friday Focus room alternates each week and gets a deep clean, the idea being that it eliminates the need for spring cleans and makes sure your house just keeps on getting cleaner. Now living in Kent, Gemma is originally from Altrincham in Greater Manchester where she worked in her familys fish and chip shops. Before having children she owned chip shops herself in Suffolk, and it was while still working  days there that she first started TOMM - doing  minutes in the morning and  minutes at night.  Its taken off so much that it recently became her job, with revenue from sponsorship and collaborations with brands so that she can keep her method free for people to download. She said: I never really expected it to take off. In fact, I followed TOMM privately for years and it was only a couple of years ago, one New Years Eve, when my kids dared me to start an Instagram page all about it. I took them up on their dare. It really struck a chord and people started to share the method and it really gained traction quickly. I first noticed it was starting to make some waves last Christmas, when I was asked to go on Good Morning Britain to talk about it. Gemma, who is married to Mike, , and mum to Tom, , Jonny, nine, and three-year-old Ben, puts part of the success down to the team spirit that comes with TOMM. She said: Not many people enjoy cleaning but unfortunately we have to do it. I try my best to make cleaning fun, I put together daily Spoty playlists for people to rock the housework to and the sense of community that people feel when they know that thousands of others are cleaning their living room at the same time is amazing. I think so many people have joined Team TOMM because it gives them motivation to keep on top of the housework without having to be cleaning for hours every day. The team spirit is amazing and on the Team TOMM Facebook group we have such a strong sense of community - we currently have , members. If someone is having a bad day or needs cleaning tips everyone rallies round. It is actually lovely to see. And its not just mums who are on board with Gemmas plan. TOMM promotes a balanced approach to keeping on top of it all, which means it is achievable for busy people, she said. Sht workers, busy parents, non-parents can all follow the method - plus, it is completely free to download.

When Mary Crumpton made a letime commitment to John Hulls earlier this year, she was supported by by her husband Tim Crumpton - who even walked her down the aisle at a special ceremony. Its all part and parcel of polyamory - the practise of openly being in a romantic relationship with more than one person at a time, with the consent of everyone involved.Mary lives with Tim and John under the same roof in Chorlton, and is in equally committed and loving relationships with both of them, reports the Manchester Evening News.She also has two boyfriends who live nearby. Andany of Marys four partners wanted to start seeing another woman at the same time, shed be happy for them.  Mary first spoke out about her relationships earlier this year, in a bid to demysty polyamory and help people understand what it really means. Now she is taking it one step further, and getting ready to lobby for a change in the law, to allow people in the UK to be legally married to more than one person at a time. In her heart, Mary is married to both Tim and John - but only her commitment to Tim is legally recognised, something Mary is adamant must change. John was already living with me and Tim before John and I had our ceremony, explains Mary, .  He moved in with us in  so wed already got into a stable and happy domestic situation, so its not changed anything practically, but it has changed things emotionally for me. Its lovely to be able to feel that Ive made that commitment to John, so that hes not in second place any more. We got to the point where John and I both felt that we wanted to make that letime commitment, but obviously in this country you cant marry more than one person. Tim was fully supportive of mine and Johns commitment to one another. Mary and Johns ceremony took place at Chorlton Unitarian Church. They made vows to each other, and Tim and John made extra vows, promising to honour and respect Marys commitment to the other man. The church is very forward thinking, they were the first to do homosexual marriages and civil partnerships so they are very inclusive and respectful of ersity, says Mary. I went to the church and said that Id like to have a wedding with John. I told them I knew it wouldnt be a legal wedding, but I wanted it to be a wedding in every other respect. They ran it by the committee and everyone was fully supportive. Thats quite an amazing thing because as far as I know, its the first polyamorous wedding ceremony thats happened in a church in the UK. People have had handfastings in fields, but an actual church saying yes we will do this for the first time, weve made history and Im proud of that. I hope that other churches will follow on. The way we did it, with the help of a minister, Laura Dobson, we structured a service, with a walk down the aisle, the white dress. There wasnt a dry eye in the house! Everyone was really moved by the whole thing.  We kept a lot of the things that are in a normal service, we kept all those normal wordings in - we promised letime commitment. Clearly we werent going to say excluding others because Im married to Tim as well! It was lovely, having all the family there and everybody being so supportive. There were lots of people whod never seen anything like this before and got used to it through seeing it happen, coming up afterwards saying: Mary that was amazing, I didnt get it before but I can see that its really working for you so that was lovely. Since then everything has been great. Tim and John get on great, theyll go off on bicycle rides together - they joke that Im a bit of a wild one and it takes two of them to keep me in line! Mary is keen to push for change to marriage laws so John has the same legal rights as Tim, who she married in . In our hearts, he is my second husband, I have two husbands, but clearly legally, Tims the only one, says Mary.  There are plenty of people in my situation who have more than one partner they would like to commit to for le, be it same sex or dferent sex. If I want to have two husbands, then Id like that to be respected in law as well, and I dont see any reason why it shouldnt be. At the moment, because Im not legally married to John as well as to Tim,I was knocked down by a bus tomorrow and was in hospital, Tim would be my next of kin and gets to make all the decisions and John would not be recognised. Clearly Tim and John are close and therefore of course Tim would consult John, butthey disagreed about a decision, what would happen then  Johns rights are not respected. Other things like,I die and I havent made a will, everything would go to Tim and John would get nothing. I have to make a will to make sure everything gets split between them.  ButId been able to legally marry John as well as Tim, then I wouldnt have to go that extra mile, it would just be automatic. Theres things like that, where John has no legal rights because I cant marry him legally and that upsets me, and there are a lot of people in the country that this affects, who are in a similar situation, who are having to do work-arounds to make sure that any partner they are not married to get fully respected. I would really like to see a change in the law. Weve done marriage for people in homosexual relationships, this is the next thing that needs to happen. I think there needs to be a big campaign, people need to write to their MPs, get the issue raised in parliament and go from there really. Thats my target for next year, do some research and get as many people on board as possible to make it happen. Theres lots of people who arent polyamorous but know people who are, and Ive said this to them and they say absolutely, quite right, you should have your other relationship respected and legalised, thats perfectly reasonable. The first thing was lets talk about it, lets get other people talking about it and get it more accepted and less judged, and go from there. So watch this space. Mary says there are more people living in polyamorous relationships in the UK than people might realise. There are lots of people living like this, theres a UK poly group, theres a Manchester poly meet-up group, people get together. They have confidentiality rules because a lot of people havent told their families or workplaces.  When I first started looking into it I thought there wouldnt be anybody, but theres loads of people. The Manchester polyamorous community is quite big, they have meet ups a couple of times a month, theres a lot more people living this way than you would imagine. You could have a married couple next door, and you think they are going out with a friend but actually its their partner, because they are discreet about it. Since Mary last spoke out about polyamory, Tim has started seeing someone, but far from being jealous, Mary says she is pleased that her husband is happy, and would give her blessing to any of her partnersthey wanted to pursue relationships with more women. They are very welcome to . My husband Tim has recently started seeing a new lady, and thats going really well, says Mary. Theyve all been on dates occasionally but not really developed any relationships particularly. This is the first time Tim has formed a bond with someone, so hopefully this one will pan out. Im very, very pleased for him. Its very exciting. I think jealousy arises because of fear of losing somebody. My relationship with Tim is so good, and I know that we love each other so much that I dont feel in the slightest bit threatened by him falling in love with someone . I know its not going to affect him and me at all. Knowing that, I can just sit back and be really pleased for him that he has some extra happiness in his le. Its no dferent tohed joined a darts team and was suddenly going out every week to play darts, Id be pleased he had a new interest. I see him having a new partner as the same thing, Im pleased hes got something new in his le, bringing him some joy. I know the person and shes lovely so I could not be happier, Im really happy to finally see him having that as well. Ive had the joy of being in love with more than one person and hed been open to it but it hadnt really happened, so to see him exploring that is just great. People are used to the idea of you having a second child,you have a second child it doesnt mean you love the first one any less so people understand that love is not a limited resource. I just say, romantic love works the same way as that kind of love, I can love more than one person at the same time, actually, a lot of people can. A lot of people have been in that situation of being in a relationship with one partner and loving someone , and they either pretend that they havent got those feelings, or they have an affair, neither of which are great outcomes. A lot of people do understand is that it is possible to love more than one person, the only dference is people in my situation talk about it and find a way to make it work. As for whether or not shed consider another relationship herself in future, Mary is thinking practically. Even though I say love is not a limited resource, time is. There are only seven days in a week, to try to have more partners than that would be a challenge, she says.

The -year-old mirror is believed to be possessed once a year by Edward John Smith, who left it on the dressing table of his home in Stoke-on-Trent before he set sail on the ill-fated ships infamous maiden voyage. A servant of the captain, Ethelwynne, was offered to take one item from his home when he went down with the ship after the vessel hit an iceberg on April ,  as a keepsake and in lieu of wages. But the terried maid told relatives she could still see Captain Smiths face in the silver-framed easel mirror each year on the anniversary of when the Titanic sank. Since then, the haunted mirror was passed down by Ethelwynnes relatives and was later discovered in a deceased estate in Wolverhampton before coming into possession of current owner David Smith, who kept it in a vault for the last five years.  The letter, penned by Ethelwynnes sister-in-law Hilda and addressed to someone called Ida, chillingly reads: She [Ethelwynne] always spooked me when she said that at times she could still see Captain Smiths face in it on the anniversary of when the Titanic was sunk. Auctioneer Richard Winterton said: The last time Captain Edward John Smith saw his own noble, bearded visage before leaving home to take the helm of the Titanic was possibly in this very mirror. Even with ones feet firmly on land and in the sunshine of a clear afternoon, there is something otherworldly about seeing your own reflection in such an object.  Captain Smith must have surveyed his own image in this mirror countless times and the legend that his face can still be seen in it on each anniversary of the Titanics sinking is as compelling as it is chilling! Whoever buys this in December will have it in good time to test that legend for themselves on the th anniversary next April. The mirror is expected to fetch more than pound, from collectors when it goes up for auction in Lichfield, Staffs, with Richard Winterton Auctioneers this December.  Included with the mirror is a small brown envelope containing the handwritten note and explaining the items provenance. A statue of Smith was unveiled in Lichfields Beacon Park in July , with the cathedral city chosen as the location due to Lichfields status as the centre of Staffordshires diocese. The plaque on the memorial statue commemorates Smiths great heart, a brave le and a heroic death, adding in quotes Be British - a reference to Smiths stf upper-lip in the face of impossible adversity and what were widely believed to be - yet unsubstantiated as - his final words.  Bargain Hunt and Dickinsons Real Deal star Richard added: Interest in the Titanic is as strong as ever. This mirror could fetch well in excess of pound, at auction. Last month, a couple was left terried after the ghost of the captain of the Titanic photobombed them in a historic pub with connections to the doomed ship. Cheryl, , and Luke Arkless, , hit the headlines after they visited Belfasts Robinsons pub and snapped a romantic shot together they were horried to spot a spooky face right behind them - which they believe bears a great resemblance to Captain Smith.

The young man from China, put on an incredible show at the FISM World Championships of Magic back in July, going on to win the award for Best Trick.

When you get down to it, you might soon discover that what works for you, doesnt feel so good for your partner and vice versa. And when it comes to pleasing the ladies, recent research has shown that up to  percent of women have dficulty reaching climax, while for others the Big O is achievable but is likely to be short and sweet. However scientists think they may have stumbled across a new trick that will lead to longer and better orgasms for women. Yay!  So whats the secret to increasing theof an orgasm  Surprisingly its actually really simple - all you have to do is add a sex toy into the mix. According to bodyandsoul, sex toy retailer Lovehoney discovered this little gem of information after commissioning a study into the science of sex. The aim of the racy study was to find out what really happenswhen a woman approaches orgasm with a sex toy, and without one.  And the results clearly found that a woman can orgasm faster and for  percent longer on average when shes using a sex toy. The brain patterns of  women were analysed by neuroscientists as they climaxed and they saw that the womens Alpha brainwave levels dramatically increased when a sex toy Lovehoneys new Happy Rabbit range was used. Dr Nicole Prause, who was leading the study, said: Our original hypothesis was that the Happy Rabbit would bring women to orgasm quicker than manual masturbation. However we found that women wanted to play, explore and enjoy their new toy, which resulted in a longer lasting sexual experience with broader physical sensations and more excitement than using their hand alone. So there you have it folks, time to invest in a new toy."},{"url":null,"title":"explore worlds best buildings 2018","story":"Explore the worlds best buildings of  - from tribal retreats to clf-top homesThe World Architecture Festivaland INSIDE World Festival of Interiors Awards  will judge over  shortlisted entries across  countriesShare and INSIDE World Festival of Interiors Awards  will judge over  shortlisted entries across  countries\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _monoarchi_treewow__lr.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" and INSIDE World Festival of Interiors Awards  will judge over  shortlisted entries across  countries\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _monoarchi_treewow__lr.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" and INSIDE World Festival of Interiors Awards  will judge over  shortlisted entries across  countries\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _monoarchi_treewow__lr.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" and INSIDE World Festival of Interiors Awards  will judge over  shortlisted entries across  countries\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _monoarchi_treewow__lr.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" and INSIDE World Festival of Interiors Awards  will judge over  shortlisted entries across  countries\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _monoarchi_treewow__lr.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" and INSIDE World Festival of Interiors Awards  will judge over  shortlisted entries across  countries\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _monoarchi_treewow__lr.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" and INSIDE World Festival of Interiors Awards  will judge over  shortlisted entries across  countries\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _monoarchi_treewow__lr.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"CommentsByTom HowellLaura Forsyth:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsPatricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science by Grimshaw which is based in Miami, Florida, USA Hundreds of the worlds best buildings will compete to win a top prize at a prestigious architectural awards festival.The World Architecture Festivaland INSIDE World Festival of Interiors Awards  will host its eleventh edition in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, from November  to .This is the first time the event has been hosted in the Dutch capital.

The incidents happened after regional government officials decreed a state of alert as a fierce storm battered the north of Tenere and other parts of the Canary Islands.Garichico was one of the worst-affected areas, with waves crashing over the sea wall and flooding streets to the astonishments of locals who filmed the water racing towards them as they ran for safety. Further south, in the holiday hotspot of Adeje there were also reports of waves breaking the windows of a hotel restaurant, although again there were no injuries.

Animal welfare groups slammed the unidentied hunter for sending his dogs to trap the wild animal today, as they shared the footage on social media. The incident happened near the village of Herreruela in the western province of Caceres, Spain. An passerby can be overheard shouting to the hunter: “Run, the dogs are falling” as the first three go over the edge while the others bite at the deer. He repeats his warning as the dogs’ owner appears, shouting out to him: “Run, three dogs have already fallen”. The hunter fails to pick up his pace and ambles over to the pack of animals before appearing to make a botched attempt at finishing off the deer by stabbing at it with a kne.  Several more dogs plunge to the bottom of the clf, followed by the deer, as he moves back, making a loud noise as they crash to the ground. It was not immediately clearany of the animals had survived the fall, although a spokesman for the Royal Spanish Hunting Federation said the dogs had been treated at the scene by professionals before being taken to nearby veterinary surgeons.  Pablo Iglesias, leader of left-wing party Podemos, tweeted: “The people responsible for this atrocity only have one name criminals. “Let’s end this once and for all and punish those who are guilty. A warning, the images are very distressing.”  Political party PACMA, which stands in Spanish for ‘The Animalist Party against the Mistreatment of Animals and wants hunting with animals banned across the country, added: “The cruelty of hunting. A deer and several dogs fall over the edge of a clf. “It’s time to demand responsibility from politicians who are insensitive to the suffering and lives of animals.”  Pro-hunting lobbies described the incident as an “isolated accident” which they said was the result of the “instinct and the nature of the dogs”. The Royal Spanish Hunting Federation said: “Immediately afterwards the dogs involved were assisted by vets at the scene and at veterinary surgeries”, although it gave out no information on whether any had survived.

Ferry’s Gray Street with a cafe that would sell the popular beverages.But despite being under consideration by council planning chiefs, the application has now been withdrawn.Architect Paul Doig, who tabled the plans on Mr Douris’s behalf, said the decision was taken after it became clear Dundee’s over-provision laws made it unlikely the premises would be granted an alcohol licence.Mr Doig said: “We’ll be coming back with another plan, although we’re not sure what just yet.“But it won’t be a gin bar, that much is clear.”New rules introduced by Dundee City Council this year make it harder for new shops and pubs to sell alcohol, as they have to prove they won’t harm public health in doing so – or face having their application rejected.Mr Douris previously told the Tele he wanted to bring “something new and exciting” to Broughty Ferry.But Sandro Paladini, from the Broughty Ferry Traders’ Association, said the area was already well served by other pubs and bars.Mr Paladini said: “This particular application is an interesting and creative one, however, I believe that Broughty Ferry is very well serviced already for wine bars and hospitality.“Beyond that, this is a good corner unit in one of Broughty Ferry’s prime locations and I am sure there will be interest from another business.“I believe a good book shop would be an excellent addition.”Local councillor Craig Duncan said he would welcome a reapplication for the development but agreed that the Ferry is not suffering from a lack of licensed premises.He said: “I think the Ferry at the moment does have a choice of venues serving alcohol – whether that is pubs or restaurants.“It could be that they just don’t think the idea has enough legs or it’s not a big enough space.“I think there’s already a good range butsomething

How you come back from that type of injury is normally how much you put into your rehab.“Mark has given absolutely everything. He is out running, he is out doing the warm-ups with the other players.“Mark is out running with physios when we are training. It is great to see him with his boots on and getting that step closer.“There might be some set-backs along the way with that type of injury but it is all systems go. Mark has been fantastic and the physios could not be more pleased with him.”Reynolds limped off just  minutes into the friendly with Cove Rangers. A scan revealed the extent of the damage and he subsequently underwent surgery in Glasgow.That friendly was abandoned as Cove’s Jordon Brown, , suffered a serious head injury in an accidental collision with Dons defender Considine in the second half.An ambulance was called, with spectators asked to leave, and Brown received treatment for more than  minutes.The ex-Aberdeen youngster has gone on to make regular appearances for Cove this season.“If Mark gets close round about January, in the winter break, to coming back then he has done extremely well,” said McInnes.“It can be a seven to eight-month injury.“Considering he did it in July, as good as Mark is doing and encouraged as we are, we still have to be careful.“It is a serious injury and we have to treat it that way.”Reynolds’ serious knee problem was the first set-back in what would become an injury crisis for Aberdeen in the early throes of this season. At one point, McInnes had eight players out injured.Reynolds and on-loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban, who is recovering from shoulder surgery, are the only two long-term absentees for the Dons now.Aberdeen are to assess the extent of the injury to Devlin that forced him tofrom the Scotland squad.McInnes said: “We did not have our troubles to seek with injuries. It was the worst injury situation since I have been at Aberdeen.“With Mark, he had done all the pre-season work so to then get injured in a pre-season game sticks in the throat a wee bit.“But that is the nature of the game and with injuries you can never foresee when they come.“Thankfully we have dealt with them as a squad and Mark is dealing with his injury.”"},{"url":null,"title":"charity walk for kids cause","story":"A dog-walking group is hoping to break its own record with a charity event.Bella and Co, a socialisation group based in the north-east, is raising money for charity Cash for Kids Mission Christmas appeal.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Fiona Coughtrie, , and Stephen Thomson, , were caught metres away from targeted store Aldi in Prestwick after pinching the generator on June . The blundering thieves made attempts at a getaway but were snared a short distance away at the traffic lights on Ayr Road. Ayr Sherf Court heard the stolen electrical device was worth pound.. Defending Coughtrie, of Galloway Avenue, solicitor Tony Currie said: “Slightly unusual as I don’t think either of them have a caravan. “It requested both of them to carry the item out of the shop. “This is an offence that was against a background of a chaotic lestyle and drug issues.” Mr Currie explained the pair were then caught “literally straight at the traffic lights”. Sherf John Montgomery commented the theft attempt was “rather pathetic”. Defending Thomson, of Elba Gardens in Ayr, solicitor Ian Gillies said: “Mr Thomson and Miss Coughtrie were living together but they’ve decided to part – and I don’t think that’s a bad thing. They’ve been getting themselves involved in drug-taking. “Mr Thomson could do with some support.” Sherf John Montgomery told the pair: “You both tell me that you want to change – well I can provide you with an opportunity to do that with a community payback order. “If you don’t comply with the terms of the order you’ll be brought back before me and we know what will happen.” Coughtrie and Thomson were ordered to be under supervision for  months.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCourtsPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

general inspection since .MP John Lamont believes the figures show the Scottish Government is failing Borders pupils.He said: ldquoParents in the Borders will find it shocking that one in five schools have been waiting more than a decade for an assessment by Education Scotland.\"While I understand that inspections can be stressful for teachers, they need to be taking place more regularly than they are.\"Inspections are vital for parents to make an informed choice about their childrsquos education.\"Many young families look at these reports before a potential move and with so many out of date in the Borders, it can only be putting people off.\"But our hard-working teachers are also being let down because inspections provide important feedback and advice.\"Among the  local schools which havent been fully inspected in the past decade are Hawick High School , Priorsford Primary , Stow Primary , Walkerburn Primary , Broomlands Primary , Fountainhall Primary , Jedburgh Grammar Schooland Eyemouth High .Its also been nine years since Berwickshire High was inspected, eight years since Earlston High, seven years since either Peebles High or Kelso High were visited and five years since

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this year."},{"url":null,"title":"a72-to-close-at-clovenfords-while-manhole-cover-is-repaired","story":"DRIVERS in the Tweed Valley are being warned the A will be closed at Clovenfords this Sunday.Scottish

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience.

IIn the final minutes the Pupils were denied what seemed a stonewall penalty.Who knows what the score would have beenit had been given and converted.Looking forward to a better team performance, Campbeltown Pupils travel to play Easthall in the league tomorrow.Gary Grumoli was in the thick of the action till going off injured in the closing moments. _cpupilsSary Rahma caught in a balletic move in front of the Neilston goal. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"off road cycle time trial given a yellow jersey","story":"Perfect sunny but cool conditions with hardly a breath of wind, saw  riders, of all abilities, head for the Lussa Loch TT at am on Sunday morning.Club chairman Robert Semple gave his usual safety briefing before the event being run in a semi-remote location.Despite the clear conditions, he gave a word of warning when he advised riders to take great care particularly on descents, saying: #If you go into a ditch on this course you#ll not be climbing back out of it.#It was not just the premiere time trial on forest roads for KWCC but for some road riders, the .-mile event was their first time on mountain bikes.Alex Binnie dubbed the #rocket man,# finished first and said: #Yet another well organised event, Robbie.#I really enjoyed it today, over the moon with my time but I#m pretty sure I#ll not be top of the winter league for long, but in the meantime I#m loving it.#Cycling crofter, Emma Smith, from Taynuilt, came in second having spent the previous day beating for pheasant at Ormsary.McFadyens Contracting director, Tom Millar said: #Very well organised, Robbie, well done, Alex, a great race.#The full results:  Alex Binnie .

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

The location has been selected as it forms the primary gateway into the town and is visible from the railway line, said the applicants.Ken Ross, from applicant Hallhill Development Ltd, said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Scottish Government has approved this fantastic piece of public art and are actively engaged with Andy to get the bear erected in Dunbar in spring .ldquoThis piece of art will not only contribute to the emerging identity of Dunbarrsquos new gateway but has the potential to draw people into the area to find out more about John Muir.Mr Ross was confident the sculpture would prove popular with children and would become a landmark.The sculpture is made of welded steel and fabricated from steel plates of ious thicknesses, heavy at the bottom and lighter towards the top. Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire. He said: ldquoThe proposal has had a range of dferent opinions within the community.ldquoHowever, any piece of new artwork that is ever produced and put into a location always has dferent opinions from dferent people about whether it is good or not.ldquoThe artist selected to produce this is well-known.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

You must be afraid of the isions politics has produced and the invective that comes with it  It seems everyone wants to be angry.ldquoIrsquom sick of politics, he admits. ldquoIrsquom completely disenchanted with all of it. Politicians lack so much knowledge. If Irsquom honest, I donrsquot think therersquos a politician out there worth listening to, of any creed or colour. I donrsquot have any truck with any of them. Irsquom just looking away at the moment while they do what they do, which is self-aggrandizing and performing their Punch and Judy nonsense. I cannot be bothered with it.He adds: ldquoI was in that arena vaguely for a while on account of a few opinions I was invited to give.He certainly was. Oliver incurred the wrath of the Nationalists back in  when he declared independence for Scotland a \"dead dog.\"But does he now regret becoming involved in the independence debate He pauses for thought. ldquoNo, I think itrsquos important to say what you think is true. But I donrsquot like the atmosphere at the moment whereby you canrsquot say what you think. If you are not pleasing the social media mob you are silenced or destroyed. I was asked some questions and I gave an honest answer.Oliver rejects the offer of half a sconeand instead sips at his coffee cup. ldquoHow it really started for me was when I was being interviewed for Bannockburn  [his TV show] and a journalist asked me about the referendum. ldquoI remember saying, lsquoA referendum is like going shopping for food when yoursquore hungry.rsquo You donrsquot want to be making snap decisions.Because you come away with a packet of Hobnobs and a jar of Nutella  ldquoExactly. I donrsquot think we should have referendums to decide which side of the road we should drive on, never mind kicking the ball back to the general population to determine a nationrsquos destiny. Thatrsquos why we have political democracy, whereby we employ hundreds of people to read tedious paperwork, shout and bawl at each other in a room for as long as it takes. Thatrsquos why these -odd people have a job.He becomes more animated. ldquoReferendums are a bad idea. After the Scottish referendum there were immediate cries for another one. lsquoThat disnae countrsquo. Now therersquos been Europe. And that was seen to be wrong. And so you claim for another one. What do you do  Go for best of three  Or best of five Oliver smiles. ldquoIrsquove never been a card-carrying member of a political party. I used to scoff at university friends who were. In the same way I couldnrsquot understand why anyone would get excited about football. Irsquom not minded that way.Yet, but he is minded to recognise how politics overlaps into culture and issues of identity, which he loves to wax lyrical about on his TV shows. But there are those who donrsquot countenance his passion for explaining the likes of Iona and the coming of Christianity. Some, such as Professor Tom Devine, see Oliver as an irritant.The historian once attacked the fact Oliver had been asked to front a History of Scotland ndash given he didnrsquot have a degree in history.Oliver didnrsquot take Devinersquos comment laying down however, describing the historian as being like of the old grumps from The Muppets.More recently, Oliver got it in the neck when appointed president of the National Trust for Scotland, and many Nationalists demanded his removal, which seemed odd given the TV presenterrsquos passion for this space we live in.But the writer presenter took it on broad shoulders. Did his personal history prepare him for the future stre  Seems so. Hersquos used to adjustment. ldquoI was born in a council flat in Renfrew, my dad moved to Ayr to work [he was a commission salesman] and then to Dumfries. The family was ldquocomfortable, he says. It certainly wasnrsquot an Angelarsquos Ashes set in Scotland storyline. They even managed a holiday to Spain once.Yet, the man who would go on to explain the Picts and Vikings and anacyclosis to uswasnrsquot top of the class at school. ldquoI was in the upper half but I wasnrsquot so great at maths and science so I focused on English and history, which I was quite good at.Oliver was blessed with encouraging parents who most likely were baffled why their son wanted to study archaeology, University I fell in love with the prospectus given it rarely leads to a career. ldquoI did work as an excavator for a few years going on digs, he recalls. ldquoIt was fun, but there was no money in it. And during the winters it became a bit grim.One Friday afternoon he was excavating the Roman Road in Greenock, and on the Monday he was covering a peace protest in Lockerbie for the local newspaper. Why the switch to journalism ldquoI liked the idea of journalism because it was essentially noseyness about people, he explains, grinning. ldquoItrsquos a bit like archaeology in that itrsquos the chance to poke through the rubbish, to find out what people were doing and why. Instinctively, I want to know who, what, where, why and when.Journalism has been as important to his current career, he says, as his time spent scraping dirt with a big spoon. ldquoWhen Irsquove been cast in the likes of Coast as a presenter it helped me get something out of people. And this Magpie-like work taught me how to become engrossed in a subject for a day then drop it, and move onto something .The curious mind continued to search for the next adventure and in  he joined a BT internet company. ldquoI thought that may be my future. I was also fascinated to learn how it had evolved, largely financed by the US military, who wanted to knowcomputers could survive after a nuclear attack. And so they hired these hippies to find out. And then I wondered what do we do with it  What are the consequences of it He answers his own question: ldquoItrsquos created titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon, Google and Pay Pal. He adds in soft, serious voice, ldquoNow, Zuckerberg is almost at the point he has more power than Putin, without the missiles.While working for the internet company, Oliver decided to set off for Zululand.ldquoI had met up with my close pal from university Tony Pollard one day in the Granary Bar in Glasgowrsquos Shawlands and we came up with the idea of going to Zululand to make a film [which became the BBCrsquos  documentary, Two Men In A Trench].Boldness has to be part of the reason for Oliverrsquos success. He had a good job, with a good salary, a car and an Amex account. ldquoBut I didnrsquot have a mortgage. I wasnrsquot married. I could take a chance. And I knew I had had experience. When the TV job ran out Irsquod do something .Does the job flipping suggest a malcontent  ldquoNo, when I was at BT I figured Irsquod give it a couple of years, he says with a wee hint of umbrage in his voice for me having suggested such a thing. ldquoAnd we made the film really because we wanted to go to South Africa. The voice warms again: ldquoArchaeology was my first love and we met again. It was like Friends Reunited. And wersquove been together ever since.Hersquos a television natural. But did he always feel confident speaking to the camera  ldquoYes. Irsquove always had a good memory and Irsquom lucky in that I can remember  words in the right order, he says, grinning. ldquoTalking to the camera is not a natural thing to do. Itrsquos like a golf swing. But some people can do it. And I enjoyed being with these like-minded people. It was quite collegiate. I loved it from the get-go.Oliver landed on the box at the right time. ldquoI was   when television began to happen for me. I had few delusions about my own reality. Irsquod been in a few dferent jobs, had the rougher edges knocked off by le experience. Irsquod filled shelves at Presto supermarket while eating the Mars Bars. Irsquod worked on an MS till. He adds, with a wry smile, ldquoIrsquod been dumped often enough by women.Women. Yes, now hersquos married to one. And history taught him he should incorporate this woman into his future. Oliver met his future we Trudi when he was at university. ldquoI was in third year at the time, the president of the archaeology society and she was in first year, and she came in to join. I made a bee-line for her when she walked in the door.He grins. ldquoI donrsquot think she was as impressed by me as I was by her.She must have liked him a little because the pair were together for seven years. ldquoAnd it just sort of fizzled out. Then, years later, I met her wee brother Johnny and we swapped numbers and a few months after that I was back in touch with Trudi. It was asIrsquod seen her the day before.He reflects: ldquoThatrsquos another great thing about my le. Whatever happens, I know Irsquom with someone who remembers me when I was  and a silly arse. She remembers me when I had all sorts of archaeology student affectations, all patchouli oil and cheese cloth shirts. We can remember the teenagers we were.Oliver reveals he had the long hair back in the day. He didnrsquot create the soft Tarzan look for telly. He has just never bothered to have it cut. And it works for him, gives him a USP, although watching him on TV with the wind blasting into his face as he stands on a clf edge he does have to brush it away from his mouth a little too often but, I suppose, a kirby grip or a hair scrunchy would wreck the image.He laughs. ldquoIrsquove been holding out for the Head and Shoulders contract for  years but itrsquos never happened.Therersquos a calm about Oliver, even though he does become animated when he talks about the politics he says he wants nothing to do with. And he clearly loves his le, beaming at the delights of a career which allows him to take his family adventuring in the likes of Australia and New Zealand while filming Coast.

Irsquom going to look at the detail closely before coming to a final decision about how I will vote in the deal when it comes to the House of Commons.Mr Masterton, elected as the MP for East Renfrewshire last year, wrote on a blog:ldquoDeciding whether or not to support this deal will, short of a decision on whether to go to war, be the biggest decision MPs will make. I will not be rushed, bounced, or forced into reaching a position. To do so would be irresponsible and do you a disservice. You deserve a decision of this magnitude to be properly thought through.ldquoI have read the documents carefully and have a number of concerns. These relate primarily to the Northern Ireland backstop , and aspects of the future relationship framework where there is a real lack of detail.He continued: ldquoI now need to work through those concerns and understand the practical reality and real-world implications in a number of areas. So as of today, I am not in a position to state that I will be supporting the deal.However, he also wrote that leaving the EU without a deal would be a ldquoterrible outcome and voting against the May plan poses an ldquoinherent risk.Mr Duguid wrote yesterday that he is continuing to ldquoseek and receive assurances that the UK will leave the CFP and become an ldquoindependent coastal state.He added: ldquoEU demands for continued, guaranteed access is UNACCEPTABLE.While Mr Lamont and Mr Masterton voted Remain in the  referendum, Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson voted for Brexit.The MP stepped up his criticism of Mayrsquos plan yesterday: \"The PMrsquos plan would create serious new trade barriers between GB and NI. As a Unionist first and foremost I can never accept that.With May struggling to cobble together a parliamentary majority for the draft deal, she desperately needs her Scottish MPs onside.SNP MP Stephen Gethins said: \"With all wings of her party against her, it is abundantly clear that Theresa May has no chance of getting her deal through parliament - leaving us all in political purgatory.ldquoRather than trying to please the Prime Minister, the Scottish Tories should be listening to their constituents who voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU.\"The best deal short of EU membership is to remain in the single market and customs union.\"It is essential that we avoid both Theresa Mays hard Brexit and a No Deal scenario - and all options must be on the table to achieve that.\"A Scottish Tory spokesman said: \"Scottish Conservative MPs know that their constituents will expect them to scrutinise this draft agreement in detail before they vote, and that is exactly what they are doing.\"Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will tell a forum in Dundee on Monday that Brexit in any form is likely to reduce economic growth.She will use her address at the National Economic Forum on Monday to reiterate her call for the UK to remain part of the single market and customs union.She is expected to tell delegates that leaving the single market will do \"immense damage\" to jobs and living standards in Scotland.Sturgeon will say: \"The UK Governments refusal to even consider the Scottish Governments detailed plan to keep Scotland in the single market, while accepting a dferentiated solution for Northern Ireland, which we support, potentially puts Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.\"But, perhaps worst of all, it leaves everybody completely uncertain about the shape of our long-term relationship with the EU.\"The seven-page political declaration on the future contains little more than vague aspirations and platitudes.\"But while we can expect more pages forthcoming on some aspects of the future relationship, there will be no concrete reassurances.\"The governments National Economic Forum is a regular event attended by ministers and senior figures from business, the public sector and trade unions to discuss how best to grow Scotlands economy.Sturgeon will address delegates at the Apex City Quay Hotel on the theme of innovation and inclusion.She will say: \"Put bluntly, long-term economic uncertainty is hard-wired into the Prime Ministers withdrawal deal.\"If the UK Government insists on leaving the EU, then it should remain in the single market and customs union. That is the solution which respects the outcome of the referendum, mitigates the worst economic consequences of Brexit and largely resolves the Irish border issue.\"If Brexit goes ahead - in any form - it is likely to reduce economic growth.\"But that doesnt devalue our wider efforts to support business - in fact it makes those efforts all the more important.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-faces-crunch-week-as-tory-critics-plot-her-exit-from-downing-street","story":"The Prime Minister appeared to have gathered momentum on Friday after surviving a spate of resignations from her Government, but she is expected to face a series of challenges to her authority over the next few days.Conservative MPs who have angrily denounced her draft agreement with European negotiators are expected to get close to the  signatures required to force a no- confidence vote in her.A core of influential Cabinet Ministers who voted Leave in the  referendum, led by Environment Secretary Michael Gove, will also meet within days in a bid to persuade May to change course.The Tory civil war comes as senior figures in all the main parties at Westminster insist she will be unable to command a majority for her exit plan.May last week unveiled the  page draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, which was put together following fractious discussions with the EU.The UK is scheduled to leave the EU next year, but Mayrsquos problems arise from what happens after the completion of the transition period in December .Under the draft,a long-term trade deal has been not agreed by the end of , one option is for the transition period to be extended for a limited period.An alternative, in order to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is a ldquobackstop consisting of a single customs territory between the EU and the UK.However, the backstop plan infuriated some of Mayrsquos backbenchers as they believe would prevent the UK from entering into new trade deals with other countries, which they argue is one of the main benefits of Brexit.The UK would also be unable to cancel the backstop independently and would need the agreement of the EU, an outcome MPs fear would trap the UK.Publication of the draft agreement led to the resignation of members of Mayrsquos Cabinet, including Brexit secretary Dominic Raab.It also triggered a campaign on the backbenches to secure the  signatures required to force a no confidence vote in the leader.However, the move to force a vote appeared to stall after MP Steve Baker, vice-chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, over-estimated the number of signatures.Mr Baker had stated on a WhatsApp group that the number was ldquoover , which would have led to a contest, but he later backtracked and said his count had been ldquoinaccurate.One senior Tory told the Herald on Sunday that the figure could reach  by Tuesday, which would lead to a vote soon after.Another Conservative insider said a vote could be an ldquoopportunity for Mayshe won it convincingly.ldquoShe would be able to say she has a mandate for the deal on the table, he said.Another threat for the Prime Minister will come when Gove, whose decision to stay in the Cabinet last week gave May a boost, meets other Cabinet Brexiteers to discuss strategy.It was reported that Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Chris Grayling, Penny Mordaunt and Liam Fox will meet and try to force May into renegotiating elements of the draft.Meanwhile, May has warned her Tory opponents that rival Brexit withdrawal plans, including the so-called Norway and Canada models favoured by her hardline critics, would not solve the backstop issue.In an interview yesterday, the Prime Minister said: \"People say If you could only just do something slightly dferent, have a Norway model or a Canada model, this backstop issue would go away. It would not. That issue is still going to be there.May appointed Stephen Barclay as her new Brexit Secretary, the third this year, but the role has been further downgraded as the Prime Minister will in future take sole control of negotiations on EU withdrawal.The job of Barclay, a Leave supporter, will be limited to the domestic delivery of EU withdrawal, preparations for Brexit either with or without a deal and shepherding legislation through Parliament.He said: \"We now need to keep up the momentum to finalise the withdrawal agreement and outline political declaration and deliver a Brexit that works for the whole UK.\"Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the Prime Minister is \"prepared for anything\", when asked on BBC Radio s Today programmeshe was prepared for a leadership challenge.He added: \"I think that whatever deal, when we see ious dferent organisations and groups talk about dferent ways of leaving the EU - Norway, Canada, all of these things - what we have to be clear about ... is all of those require a backstop.\"In another development, Irelands deputy premier has warned MPs to sign up to the Brexit agreement or risk crashing out of the EU without a deal.Simon Coveney said people were \"too quick\" to write off May, saying she has shown \"resilience, courage\" and a \"reality check\" to Brexiteers in Westminster.He warned it \"will be dficult\" to find an alternative deal that will prevent a hard border. \"If we are forced into that situation we will have to look at ways in which that can be avoided but that will not be easy,\" he added.\"It is a far more sensible approach to support what is being negotiated over the last two years as a way that we know provides the guarantees that we have looked for and insisted on that there will be no physical border or infrastructure or checks or controls and that is an issue that goes beyond commerce and trade.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lord-lester-hopes-decision-to-block-suspension-means-the-end-of-my-ordeal","story":"Lord Lester of Herne Hill was facing the longest suspension in modern parliamentary history after an inquiry found the -year-old had sexually harassed Jasvinder Sanghera and offered her ldquocorrupt inducements to sleep with him.The Lords Privileges and Conduct Committee recommended he should be suspended until June .But on Thursday, peers backed a call to send his case back to the Lordsrsquo Committee for Privileges and Conduct by  votes to , amid claims that the investigation was ldquomanestly unfair.Following a y and impassioned debate, members agreed that the Commissioner for Standards Lucy Scott-Moncrieff had failed to comply with the code of conduct which required her to act ldquoin accordance with the principles of natural justice and fairness.In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Lord Lester ndash who denies the allegations against him and says they are ldquocompletely untrue ndash said the decision was ldquoa triumph for Parliament, and for equal justice under the law.The prominent QC blasted the investigation process, and said he had been ldquotreated despicably.He told the paper: ldquoI hope this means the end of my ordeal.

I do not believe that everyone who graduated this year has sufficient skills in numeracy to be able to teach it to -year-olds at a reasonable standard.Cue bedlam. Here for the first time was a suggestion the slide in standards could be laid at the door of poorly prepared trainee teachers unable to pass on the essential skills required to make pupils literate and numerate.Even tabloid newspapers became interested in teacher training with the front page of next days Daily Record berating the Scottish Government under the headline \"You Do The Maths\".Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson seized the moment demanding new literacy and numeracy tests for primary teachers at the beginning and end of their course.There was even graver concern when the education committee received a follow-up report from universities which said student teachers on some four-year degree courses could spend as little as  hours on numeracy and  hours on literacy.John Swinney, the Education Secretary, said he was ldquovery concerned by the findings and raised the issue with both universities and the General Teaching Council for Scotland.More than a year on and there is still resentment from some involved in teacher education over the way the issue played out.\"The students were not a representative sample,\" one member of university staff said. \"They were a very specic group who had already written to complain to the committee and they were the only ones selected to speak. It was unfortunate and we are still dealing with the consequences.\"Professor Ian Rivers, chairman of the Scottish Council of Deans of Education, is also concerned about the weight given to some of the statements made to the committee.\"There was no actual evidence that teachers who leave university are unable to teach -year-olds to the appropriate standard,\" he said. \"Every university does its absolute best, working in partnership with experienced teachers, to make sure our students leave able to meet the requirements and professional standards expected of them.\"The committee wanted the literacy and numeracy work we do neatly calculated in terms of the number of hours we deliver, but that is a very narrow view of what we do. All of the work on literacy, numeracy is integrated into the course as a whole so it is very dficult to provide what they wanted. That does not mean that literacy and numeracy is being ignored.\"Mr Rivers also questions the current narrative from headteachers and council officials that the quality of new teachers is not what it was.Local authorities have recorded an increase in the number of probationers having to repeat a year because they were not seen as being of an appropriate standard and school leaders have also raised concerns over quality.ldquoWe do not allow anyone to graduatetheir practice is not up to scratch and that is done with assessments by a member of academic staff from the university in partnership with the classroom teacher they have been working with,\" said Mr Rivers.\"It is very important to understand that teacher education is the starting point of a journey and not the end point. When students are on probation councils are also heavily involved in the development of skills and knowledge as the teacher moves towards becoming a fully registered member of the profession.\"The other concern that has unsettled public confidence in teacher education is drop-out rates. Figures published earlier this year showed the number of new teachers leaving after less than a year had doubled in just four years. In total, almost  probationers have left the profession since the   school year.While the reasons for leaving are not given a wider survey of probationers conducted last year highlighted a number of worrying concerns about the quality of courses and the experience of probationers in schools.Some trainees told how their ldquoappalling experiences at the hands of disinterested lecturers and on placement in classrooms had made them re-think their career path. One said veteran teachers had told them to ldquoleave whilst you still can while another suggested bullying was re within the profession and staff rooms a \"poisonous environment\".The Scottish Council of Deans of Education argues that the drop out rates are not particularly high and are generally stable. However, they acknowledge a growing concern over the ever-increasing demands placed on trainee teachers and the requirement that universities provide the Scottish Government with evidence of how they are addressing a iety of additional areas including looked after children, children with autism, LBGTI pupils, black and ethnic minority pupils and pupils with mental health issues.Moyra Boland, a senior lecturer from Glasgow Universityrsquos School of Education, said all of these areas were crucial, but questioned whether it was wise to try and cram them all into a one-year postgraduate course.She said: \"You can never get everything into the curriculum. That will never happen because there is so much to know in schools and it is such a complicated job. You never stop learning as a teacher because every class provides new challenges with new combinations of children.\"Rather than thinking about covering absolutely everything in initial teacher education in Glasgow we are much more focused on how we give our students the skills and dispositions to find the knowledge that they need to support their changing classrooms from year to year.\"Ken Muir, chief executive of the General Teaching Council for Scotland , also has concerns over what is expected of trainee teachers and believes the time is ripe for a wider review.He said: \"It would be a good time to look at whether the current system of a one year postgraduate followed by a one year probationary year adequately prepares teachers for the range of youngsters and experiences they will face.\"There are huge added responsibilities on teachers, and therefore on teacher education programmes, and an expectation that everything has to be covered which creates pressures and dficulties.ldquoWe need to stand back and ask,we want teachers to be skilled in covering a wide range of areas from sex education to additional support needs, can we cram all that into an  week university postgraduate programme \"Mr Muir said one solution was to look at a longer period of induction that allowed teachers to undertake the additional studies they require once they were in school so they could focus on the areas most pertinent to the context of their schools.There is also more radical thinking on the current structure of initial teacher education.Professor Chris Chapman, chair of Educational Policy and Practice at Glasgow Universitys Robert Owen Centre, wants to see barriers broken down between universities and schools.\"If we are building new schools we should look at teacher preparation in the design of those buildings. You could have studio classrooms or experimental classrooms where trainee teachers are working with university staff and teachers in a more regular and dynamic way.\"I would like to see university staff co-located in schools and working much more closely on a day-to-day basis with teachers and student teachers and engaging with research. That would create a much more dynamic and reflective set of teachers.\"Raymond Soltysek, a former teaching lecturer at Strathclyde University and now an independent educational consultant, argues Scotland could go much further.He believes the inconsistencies highlighted in the way universities deliver basic skills is an indicator of a system where students at dferent institutions study dferent subjects for dferent s of time and are assessed in dferent ways.\"Perhaps more radical initiatives should be explored,\" he said. \"Many have suggested ious structural changes, including taking professional teacher training back into the public sector.\"However, a model of public ownership might take the form of a National College of Teacher Education ndash a central body run by the GTCS, councils, Education Scotland, teachersrsquo bodies and associations ndash which would centralise matters such as recruitment, course design, student placement coordination and assessment. That would provide much greater consistency in what is delivered across Scotland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  May   s done the impossible - brought Leave and Remainers together  but only against her","story":"The Prime Minister made a dignied, resilient stand last week, before a House of Commons that loathes this proposal. But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"tumultuous-brexit-events-could-have-implications-for-scotlands-economy","story":"Arguably, the publication of the Draft Withdrawal agreement was an attempt to reconcile the un-reconcilable.

A Brexit deal that is already dead in the water with the Prime Ministerrsquos own authority at risk as the Tory Party implodes with resignation after resignation from the Government. It is increasingly clear, the Prime Minister is, or now, still in office ndash but she is not in power.The Brexit deal satisfies no one, not least the people of Scotland. Instead of coming back with a deal that protects the economy across the UK, the Prime Minister has shown utter contempt once again to the Scottish people. Despite the fact that Scotland voted to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister has decided to ignore our interests. Yet, the UK Government has agreed a dferentiated deal for Northern Ireland ndash but sold Scotland out. Quite rightly, Northern Ireland is to receive access to the European market, but that dferentiation puts Scotland at a real competitive disadvantage. We are being left high and dry by this deal. England and Wales will get what they voted for, remain voting Northern Ireland is guaranteed a special deal to stay close to the EU, yet Scotland, with the highest vote to remain of any UK nation, has our democratic wishes ignored. Instead, Theresa May wants Scotland to pay the price of a Brexit we didnrsquot support - with lost jobs, household incomes slashed and our NHS under threat.Now I wonrsquot pretend that I expect any Tory Party leader to put the interests of Scotland before their narrow party political interests ndash the broken promises of consecutive conservative leaders have taught us not to expect anything less from them. However, the context in which this conservative leader finds herself should at least cause the Prime Minister to pause for serious consideration. Consideration of the offering we in the Scottish National Party have put to her time and time again. We will vote for a deal that delivers membership of the Single Market and the Customs Union. Such a deal would protect our economy, safeguard jobs and maintain living standards. Anything less is economic catastrophe. With  strong MPs, the SNP has  votes ndash and with the parliamentary arithmetic as it is, stacked against the Prime Minister and her insufficient deal, Theresa May should start listening. She should change course.It is time for the Prime Minister toto Brussels and extend Article  to secure continued membership of the single market and the customs union. It is time for the Prime Minister to take her head out of the sand and be realistic. Thousands of jobs will be lost unless a deal is secured that will protect the future of economy. It is completely reckless to risk. Playing a game of wait and see isnrsquot good enough. There is little time left, the Prime Minister cannot sit and wait to seethe Brexiteers to come with their pitchforks. She needs to show some leadership and recognise her deal cannot get through the commons, therefore she must deliver a new deal. Only one deal will carry a majority and secure our economic future ndash and that is a deal that secures continued membership of the single market and the customs union.It has been an excruciating week for the Prime Minister, her party is ided and now she is desperate. There is only one way to see off defeat, and that is to finally put the interests of citizens across the UK first not the interests of the Tory Party. I urge the Prime Minister to take the compromise and keep us in the single market and the customs union. Should she fail, she will not be forgiven and I do not mean just by those with the pitchforks in her own party. The SNP will not allow Scotlandrsquos future to be put at risk or our economy to be ripped apart.

It was a stlingly humid, rainy day in the midst of civil war in the West African nation of Liberia when I met him back in .Along with a few other boy soldiers, J-Boy was guarding a makesht checkpoint on the Po River bridge some  miles or so from the Liberian capital Monrovia.High on cocaine and alcohol and heavily armed, the boys were in an unpredictable, volatile mood and hell-bent on extorting whatever they could from terried civilians fleeing along the road from nearby fighting.Clearly wary of our presence as journalists, my driver offered the boys cigarettes to try and relax the situation before myself and a colleague began chatting with them.Like most boy soldiers J-Boy had a swaggering, boastful air and carried his assault rle like some totemic macho badge of honour. Had he himself ever killed anyone  I eventually asked tentatively.ldquoOh sure man, plenty, plenty, he replied, grinning widely, his eyes scarily unblinking. ldquoWith this good AK, itrsquos way easy, killing, he assured me, slapping the assault rle in his lap while speaking Kreyol, the English-based pidgin spoken by many people in Liberia.It was a disquieting confession, one I had little doubt was true. The AK he was referring to of course was the AK-automatic rle, or lsquoKalashnikovrsquo as itrsquos more commonly known throughout the world.Itrsquos been said that the Russian name most often uttered across the globe is not Lenin, Stalin or Putin, but Kalashnikov. The reason is depressingly simple, for there is estimated to be as many as  million Kalashnikov rles in circulation worldwide, thatrsquos almost one for every  people.The Kalashnikov is not just any gun, but a brand name that straddles continents and is as familiar as Coca Cola. With its distinctive banana curved magazine clip, the rles familiar silhouette is part of modern iconography.Mexican drug cartel gunmen boast about their cuernos de chivo, or ldquogoat horns, because of its curved magazine. In Lebanon that same silhouette has made its way onto the flag of the Islamist Hezbollah movement while in Mozambique it features on the countryrsquos coat of arms.In other African countries, the shortened form lsquoKalash, has even become a boysrsquo name. In Britain meanwhile there is a well known racehorse named Kalashnikov, while its cultural symbolism has found its way into movies like Jackie Brown by Quentin Tarantino where black market arms dealer Ordell Robbie played by Samuel L. Jackson, praises its effectiveness for ldquowhen yoursquove absolutely, positively, got to kill every mother****** in the room.The reality of the Kalashnikov of course is anything but glamorous. It is, in effect, the modern worldrsquos most plentul and efficient killing machine, an infamous utensil of death.Had he been alive today the weaponrsquos designer, former Second World War Russian tank sergeant, Mikhail Kalashnikov, would have been  years old last week. How ironic it is that Kalashnikov himself was born almost a year to the day,  November , after the signing of the armistice on November  , that ended the First World War.No firearm of any kind has killed more people than the Kalashnikov. In the  years since its first prototype was made, the AK- has dealt death to millions. Every year, small arms kill between , and , people in the worldrsquos conflicts with the Kalashnikov accounting for a high proportion and quite possible the majority of this human toll. Kalashnikovs make up more than one in ten of all firearms globally.Despite having been around weapons for most of my working le, Irsquove always felt acutely uncomfortable by their presence. On a point of professional and ethical principle countless times Irsquove declined the chance to hold or be photographed let alone fire a weapon. It only makes an already dficult job more complex when reporters, non-combatants, are seen to be shouldering any kind of arms.Only once have I broken this cardinal rule back in the s in the remote mountains of Afghanistan.ldquoShoot, shoot, mister Daoud! insisted the Afghan commander of my guerrilla hosts for the umpteenth time, as we sat one day watching his men train at a remote camp in a craggy valley in the Hindu Kush mountains.With his holy warriors looking on, the commander slotted a full clip of the boat-tailed bullets designed to give more accuracy into a Soviet-made Kalashnikov and thrust the weapon towards me.There was an uneasy pause, but judging by the looks of the fighters around me, this had simply boiled down to an issue of initiation and acceptance, a very Afghan thing about loyalty and brotherhood. To refuse my hosts now would have made my presence at best uncomfortable, and at worst, untenable.I explained that I would do this one time only, that no photographs should be taken and that he must never ask me to do it again. The commander gave me his assurance and after only minutes of instruction, a battered plastic bottle was set up some distance away as a target.As I squeezed the trigger and the first rounds cracked against some rocks reasonably close to the bottle, the gawping bearded guerrillas who had clustered around began to grin. It wasnt a question of them ever expecting me to fire in earnest, just about passing some strange communal ritual.In the event the experience was to prove instructive, for the ease with which I was able to handle the rle made me realise why the AK- had gained its reputation as a so-called ldquouser-friendly weapon.I realised too why it had become the firearm of choice among mercenary suppliers and illegal arms dealers, who know that those who end up shouldering this oddly toy-like weapon - which fires  rounds a minute, each powerful enough to punch a hole through a personrsquos chest from  yards - will have had little or no proper military training. Or, put another way, it is ideal for everyone from Afghan peasant farmers to school-kids-turned-killers like J-Boy in Liberia or some marauding civilian gunman in an incomprehensible blood lust in a shopping mall.So robust and simple is the Kalashnikov that quite literally itrsquos a gun that child soldiers can take apart and put back together in  seconds.While not especially accurate the gunrsquos controls are unsophisticated with plenty of clearance between it moving parts meaning no matter how clogged it gets with Syrian dust or Congolese mud its mechanism is unlikely to jam and those who use these weapons like such reliability.The Kalashnikovis a weapon for ldquothe small-statured, the mechanically disinclined, the dim witted, and the untrained, observed former US marine turned war correspondent CJ Chivers in his remarkable book The Gun: The Story of the AK-.It is a weapon, he notes chillingly, that allows ldquoordinary men to kill other men without extensive training or complications. So durable is the gun that as a reporter in Afghanistan in , Chivers saw an AK- stamped with the manufacturing date of , something I too have similarly witnessed.Currently some  dferent types of Kalashnikovs are now produced in at least  countries and vast quantities of the weapons have turned up in trouble spots all over the world for decades, especially in Africa.Hundreds of thousands of them disappeared after the breakup of Yugoslavia frequently ending up in the hands of terrorists and criminals. Most of the Kalashnikovs used in the Paris attacks at Charlie Hebdo and the Bataclan theatre were purchased in Belgium and traced back to the Balkans.Recently too the war in eastern Ukraine against Russia-backed separatists has led to the uncontrolled spread of Kalashnikovs throughout the country.ldquoUkraine has turned into a supermarket for illegal weapons, says Heorhiy Uchaikin, who heads the Ukrainian association of gun owners, and estimates that Ukrainians now illegally possess as many as  million firearms the majority Kalashnikovs.ldquoIn Ukraine, a gun is like shoe polish in a shoe polish factory, Uchaikin recently observed.If ready availability makes the Kalashnikov ubiquitous, so to does its cost. According to a report by Global Financial Integrity, which monitors illicit financial flows, procuring an AK- on the black market depends on a number of factors, notably the further it travels.In Afghanistan, the gun could cost as little as  while on Mexicorsquos northern border with the US, the price would increase to ,. In Belgium where the Paris Charlie Hebdo perpetrators obtained their Balkan Kalashnikovs, it has a price tag of about ,. An authentic model would cost , in Pakistan but a locally produced model can be obtained in the countryrsquos frontier bazaars for as little as . It is also possible to obtain an AK- through the darknet where costs typically range from , to ,.The independent research group Small Arms Survey based in Geneva points also to the fact that cheaper weapons prices lead to an increased risk of civil war, independently of other conflict risk factors.Countries with more porous borders tend also to have lower weapons prices. This is especially the case in Africa, where such borders allow the supply of weapons to meet demand more readily.The Survey says that in Africa, Kalashnikov prices are the lowest in the world and falling. Income, regulatory effectiveness, war legacy, and supply cost iables all lower the price of weapons, but even controlling for these factors, being located in an African country makes purchasing an assault rle around US  cheaper than the world average.During years of working across the African continent, I have stood on many dirt airstrips watching Soviet-era cargo planes being loaded up with crates of grenade launchers, ammunition and Kalashnikovs much of which often appeared to have been beneath the radar deliveries with little in the way of accompanying ldquopaperwork.ldquoAfrican conflicts are wasteful of weapons ammunition and are always in need of more. The guys who carry this stuff in are just flying truck drivers, Alex Vine who has intensively researched the arms trade and today heads the Africa Programme at Chatham House once told me.He has a point. Back in  just before I encountered J-Boy in Liberia I flew into the capital, Monrovia, on the second humanitarian aid flight ever to have reached the country since the upsurge of the civil war a few weeks before. The aircraft was flown by a group of volunteer pilots who told me that days earlier, coming in to land on the first aid flight, they had almost collided with an unscheduled incoming cargo plane.ldquoLater we found out it was flying in ammunition and guns for President Charles Taylor, which some people said was coming from Libya, the Swedish pilot told me.ldquoIts always the same across Africa, you never know who is flying what.One member of the same pilots own crew even admitted to having ldquoferried a few Kalashnikovs and bullets in his time.Illegal trafficking in small arms and light weapons is estimated to be worth . billion to . billion every year, equivalent to about  to  per cent of the legal arms trade. With over a million Kalashnikovs still produced annually, one of the worldrsquos foremost killing machines is set to remain at the centre of the global arms trade for decades to come. Today the Kalashnikov continues to kills more people each day than all the worldrsquos tanks, warplanes and ships combined.As a servant of communism, Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died in , made no money from his invention. Had he been a capitalist as well as a master gunmaker, he would have been a billionaire.Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the Kalashnikov ldquoa symbol of the creative genius of our people.The weapon that made Kalashnikov a Hero of the Soviet Union has also appeared on t-shirts and vodka bottles, featured in videos and song lyrics and been re-fashioned in crystal - a gt from Putin to George W. Bush.Before his death in  however, the designer of the worldrsquos most famous rle expressed more than a few regrets about what he had given the world.ldquoI am proud of my weaponhellip but I wish I had invented a machine which people could use, which could do good, for example, a sowing machine, said the peasants son from Siberia. Unfortunately that will never be and sadly as child soldier J-Boy told me that day on the bridge in Liberia, ldquoWith this good AK, itrsquos way easy, killing."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

We are now all reaping the bitter harvest. The country has been landed with a bad deal and the unedying spectacle of a roguesrsquo gallery of hardline Brexiteers denouncing the product of their own actions.Parliamentary arithmetic means there is little hope of this deal surviving a vote in the Commons.With Jacob Rees-Mogg and the rest of the European Research Group in open rebellion, Dominic Raab joining an ever-growing list of former Brexit Ministers, and other Ministers going and gone, the Toriesrsquo time in Downing Street should surely be up. This is beyond a party political argument.So, of course, while there is an element of drama in watching the Tory party turning on itself, the problems of Theresa Mayrsquos deal are far more serious than that.One of Labourrsquos six tests for the Toriesrsquo Brexit is whether it delivers for all regions and nations of the UK. Theresa Mayrsquos negotiations have patently not produced a deal that delivers for the people of Scotland.Scottish Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal that best supports jobs and our economy. Which is why a few weeks after my election as Scottish Labour leader, I said that we needed a new comprehensive and permanent customs union ndash because you need that to protect our manufacturing industry and its supply chains. This would also be the cleanest and best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement.We also need a strong and stable single market relationship, one that is good for jobs in our service industries. And we need a deal that guarantees no erosion of workersrsquo and consumersrsquo rights and environmental standards.The Tories Brexit proposal delivers none of those things. For these reasons it has to be rejected by the House of Commons ndash and its why every one of Scotlandrsquos Members of Parliament, regardless of party, must vote down Theresa Mayrsquos deal.But the position of the Scottish Conservative Party is now totally untenable. Their leader, Ruth Davidson, and the Scottish Secretary David Mundell, threatened to resignthe deal did not protect the integrity of the UK. Theresa May ignored them ndash but so far they have clung on to their positions. It is remarkable that Dominic Raab has shown more backbone and integrity than either of Scotlandrsquos leading Tories.The SNPrsquos argument that there must be a separate deal for Scotland is not a matter of political principle. It is an exercise in cynical political posturing.For Scotland to be in a customs union, the logical position is for whole of the UK to be in customs union. A hard border between Scotland and the rest of UK would make even worse the economic damage of Brexit. And remember the UK single market is four times more important for Scotlandrsquos economy than the EU single market.But providing the SNP with the excuse to play fast and loose on this issue is yet another way in which Mayrsquos Brexit threatens the integrity of the UK.Should MPs vote the deal down then this would constitute a total loss of confidence in the Government. From there, the right outcome is a General Election so that the people can finish the job they started in  and sweep the Tories from power.A General Election and a change of government is necessary to break this Brexit deadlock and avoid the no deal outcome. A General Election and change of government would create the conditions for the European Union to stop the clock on Article  and to begin meaningful negotiations with a new government that can deliver a deal to parliament and the country.We need a deal that works for the whole of the UK and it is becoming increasingly clear that is something only an incoming Labour government can deliver."},{"url":null,"title":"future-shock-the-question-is-not-whether-ufos-are-real-its-why-the-us-military-have-only-now-admitted-their-existence","story":"If Trevor ever approached you in the city centre, all urine-stained jogging bottoms and uncomfortable familiarity, asking for change towards his train fare home, you wouldnrsquot hesitate to dig deep ndash perhaps handing over your pound smart phone too so he could check the Central Station timetable.Thatrsquos why I believed this establishment-approved Knight of the Realm when he said UFOs were real. The year was  ndash the fag end of true reality, a few years before the mass fractionalisation, isolationism and grotesque self-glorication bequeathed to us by the digital dawn. No phones, no internet, your gran could whistle the Top Ten and  million folk watched Coronation Street. Before Xhamster, Ken Barlowrsquos rampant bed-hopping was all teenagers had to learn about sex.This vacuum of yawning nothingness allowed for mass pop culture crazes that infected entire continents with short-lived delirium ndash and in , the brow of the globersquos collective consciousness was hot and sweaty with X-Files fever.In fact, so seismic was the showrsquos influence that ITV saw fit to dedicate an entire eveningrsquos scheduling to UFOs ndash showcased somewhat predictably in the familiar format of a  debate. Nothing that would scare the horses, then ndash or elderly folk too jiggered to get up and change the channel after Corrie.Saucers full of secretsIT was as a prelude to this peculiar pow-wow that host Sir Trevor greeted viewers with an unforgettable soliloquy. ldquoWersquore here tonight not to decideUFOs are real ndash unidentied flying objects clearly are real, he announced, steely-jawed, unblinking. ldquoSomething is in our skies. Wersquore here to discuss what they could be and from where they might originate.It didnrsquot matter that Trevor was likely reading some faceless producerrsquos hyperbolic spiel from an autocue. The signicance lay in the fact someone who didnrsquot cut his own hair or eat roadkill just told the nation UFOs were real.Even unbound by its ubiquitous acronym, unidentied flying objects being legitimised on ITV should have been a cultural watershed ndash a moment where even the most earthbound of cynics recalibrated their stance.Yet, nearly a quarter of a century later, the credibility of UFOs has lost much of its worth in terms of cultural currency. Even reputable sightings like the darting lights witnessed by several commercial airline pilots over Ireland last week barely registered a raised eyebrow.Perhaps, then, UFOs really are just a fading hangover from less informed times, when our species was far more susceptible to vague notions of the supernatural ndash before smartphone addiction stopped our minds from wandering, killing imagination, wonder and creativity stone dead.Perhaps Sir Trevorrsquos new gig chatting to folk with morals lower than snake testicles ndash not celebs, the monsters he salaciously affords the oxygen of publicity on his abhorrent Inside Death Row show ndash is also indicative of todayrsquos anaesthetised indference to anything thatrsquos not taking place within our own silos.The dying scream of a world quickly spiralling into an uninhabitable, fascist dystopia is being deafened by the static of digital isolation. In such a dystopian, self-obsessed reality, it might actually take something as seismic as the sight of a UFO hovering over a major city to dig us out our deep burrows and unite us again as a species.Escape the netTHE smoking gun often held up by cynics dismissing the UFO phenomenon is the distinct lack of any clear photos in this smartphone-dominated era.Certainly, two major online sites for reporting sightings ndash the National UFO Reporting Center and the Mutual UFO Network ndash have both experienced numerical declines parallel to Gary Glitterrsquos royalty cheques.The internet itself can certainly shoulder some of the blame for UFOs fading fame too. Despite the initial promise that free access to information and instant communication could birth a more enlightened, empowered and equal world, a grotesque funfair mirror reflection of reality has instead haemorrhaged.Without gatekeepers, lies are now afforded an equal  to truth, and the ensuing static serves only to discombobulate focus and perception. In the era of spin, reality distortion, Photoshop and Deepfakes, good luck finding credible evidence of your own existence never mind UFOs. The internet is rather like communism ndash wonderful in theory, but the cradle of true horror when human nature is added to the formulae.At times, however, some notable events do cut through the noise. Commercial pilots are certainly credible witnesses and last weekrsquos incident over the Irish sea proved that very strange things continue to happen in our skies ndash even odder than folk willingly paying pound for a coffee and biscuit.Some of the iniduals now coming forward to tell their stories are actually more plausible witnesses than those we trust to steer us through the clouds in a sky-dart ndash high ranking government employees and military personnel with nothing to gain and everything to lose. Yet, despite waving all manner of prestigious credentials, itrsquos likely they will be taken as seriously as folk who claim to have skinny-dipped with Nessie.Full DisclosureOVER the past few decades, there have been several ldquoofficial movements attempting to find some sort of objective truth on UFOs.The most high profile is lsquoDisclosurersquo, where ufologist Steven Greer herded  whistle-blowers ndashincluding astronaut Gordon Cooper and a brigadier general ndash for a fascinating press conference held in Washington DC in . The aim  To ldquoestablish the reality of extraterrestrial vehicles, le forms and advanced propulsion technologies. The bantz at that Christmas party must be awesome.Yet, groups like Disclosure are finding it tough to gain publicity in the mainstream media, where editors have licked a finger and held it to the wind, deeming the public has lost its appetite for such frivolity in an age filled with real clear and present otherworldly dangers.But who needs the media as a conduit when the lying, conspiring governments themselves are now releasing the most intriguing and credible UFO evidence for public consumption Perhaps most jaw-dropping of all the recently declassied military footage released by the US Defence Department is an encounter between Navy F- fighters and several unidentied aircraft. The recording captures several pilots discussing a hovering egg-shaped craft, apparently one of a ldquofleet. Another film trumps that however ndash showing an F-rsquos close encounter with what is clearly, well, an unidentied flying object.More sober mindsets will speculatethis was simply space junk catching the sunrsquos light or even an advanced craft piloted by tiny Russians. Yet, such speculation itself suggests something even more terrying than the existence of UFOs ndash that we might actually be completely alone in the universe. Or perhaps were simply in too early a stage of evolution to be interesting.The Pentagon comes cleanIF itrsquos a credible UFO whistleblower yoursquore after, perhaps someone with a lot to lose from being subject to ridicule from his peers, then Christopher Mellon is your man ndash a former deputy assistant Secretary of Defence for Intelligence for the Clinton and George W Bush administrations.Bemoaning the lack of transparent government investigations into valid sightings, Mellon recently told the Washington Post: ldquoI know from numerous discussions with Pentagon officials over the past two years that military departments and agencies treat such incidents as isolated events rather than as part of a pattern requiring serious attention and investigation.He also makes reference to his colleague Luis Elizondo - who used to run a Pentagon intelligence program examining evidence of ldquoanomalous aircraft - resigning in protest at the US governmentrsquos seeming indference to a ldquogrowing body of empirical data.ldquoNobody wants to be lsquothe alien guyrsquo in the national security bureaucracy, Mellon soberly concluded. ldquoNobody wants to be ridiculed or sidelined for drawing attention to the issue. Yet, the current attitude is a serious and recurring impediment to progress.Other declassied documents reveal that the US Air Force recently launched several F- fighters in a failed attempt to intercept an unidentied high-speed aircraft darting over the Pacic. Defence Department officials also confirmed more than a dozen similar incidents taking place off the US East Coast since .Itrsquos perhaps no coincidence that these stories emerged not long after the Pentagon itself publicly acknowledged the existence of a program dedicated to studying unidentied flying objects. The soberly-monikered Advanced Aviation Threat Identication Program ran from  to , but many officials claim its efforts have simply resumed under another name. Either way, admission of its existence has marked one of the most signicant disclosures about UFO government research since the infamous Project Blue Book, a y US Air Force study into thousands of sightings that was shut down in .Officially, Project Blue Book failed to find ldquoany technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientic knowledge, yet a small number of its investigations remain unexplained. And thatrsquos the thing ndasheven one of the millions of UFO sightings is true, then the phenomenon is conclusively proven. Just one.Wharsquos like US FAR from being a spectacle confined to the toothless whispers of mulleted banjo prodigies, Scotland is no stranger to wee visits from aliens, interdimentional structures, highly evolved sky dragons and time travellers from the future. Perhaps all fouryoure in Port Glasgow.Just last year, an Airbus A with  people on board which was making its final approach into Glasgow airport, came within  feet of colliding with a ldquoblue, yellow and silver object, which pilots witnessed flying underneath it. The disturbed crew immediately contacted air traffic control, stating: ldquoNot quite sure what it was but itrsquos definitely quite large and itrsquos blue and yellow. Prestwick airport backed up the sighting, with radar detecting an ldquounidentied track history . miles east of the planes position  seconds earlier.However Scotlandrsquos most infamous UFO tale, unique in British history as the only example of a close encounter becoming the subject of a criminal investigation, is known as The Livingston Incident. Forestry worker Robert Taylor claims he saw \"a huge flying dome\" in woodland near Dechmont Law on November , , describing it as seven metres in diameter, and made of a dark metallic material with a rough texture like sandpaper.Taylor claimed to have experienced an acrid smell \"like burning brakes\" and the sensation of being dragged. When police visited the site, they found marks in the soil where the craft was said to have hovered, and further tracks following the path of two ldquomine-like objects. Taylor, who died in , never sought publicity or financial gain ndash and always stood by his account.Perhaps he would have found a more sympathetic audience in Bonnybridge, home of the infamous Falkirk Trianglersquo. This well-kent ndash and henceforth thoroughly monetised ndash phenomenon was first reported in  and the area still continues to register around  sightings a year, more than any other place on Earth ndash even more than the notorious Area  in Nevada. The fact it attracts a lot of UFO tourists who are perhaps inclined to believe in the phenomenon ndash and also want their moneys worth ndash is neither here nor there, of course.Scots UFO expert Ron Halliday says: \"One theory is that there could be a window into another dimension, other worlds, the past or the future. Even Nessie probably thinks thats a bit outlandish. Although where  would you visit but Scotlandthis planet is simply some sort of space zoo for holidaying Zeta Reticulians And finally hellipTemporal lobe epilepsy is an unenviable yet fascinating condition that many doctors deem entirely responsible for all occurances of inexplicable supernatural phenomena, from UFOs to religious communion to the indeterminate forces holding Donald Trumprsquos barnet together.Those afflicted may not be aware of their condition, unwittingly suffering brief seizures, paralysis, vivid hallucinations and ndash notably ndash an overwhelming feeling of something other in their vicinity.If UFOs are indeed a purely internally projected phenomenon, we can then safely assume such stories would likely reflect current sociological, technological and cultural fears and aspirations.Certainly during the Cold War, the beings described in these close encounters were often characterised as benign saviours who wanted to help humans overcome the prospect of nuclear annihilation.And after events such as Watergate and the Vietnam war fuelled mass distrust in government, witnesses came to describe UFOs as a threat to humanity ndash their sinister occupants often rendering abductees powerless and repeatedly probing them intimately against their will.Looks like this might just be another column about Brexit after all."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-takes-swipe-at-tory-critics-ahead-of-critical-week-for-brexit","story":"The Prime Minister warned that a change of leadership would not make it easier to get a deal past parliament or the EU, after furious Brexiteer backbenchers started moves to remove her.She told Skyrsquos Ridge On Sunday that as far as she knew the -letter threshold for letters of no confidence needed to start a leadership battle had yet to be reached.In a message to those plotting her downfall, including members of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic MPs, she said she had not considered quitting.She added: ldquoA change of leadership at this point isnrsquot going to make the negotiations any easier and it isnrsquot going to change the parliamentary arithmetic.ldquoWhat it will do is bring in a degree of uncertainty.

Messiaenrsquos Quartet for the End of Time perhaps. Or John Cagersquos piece for organ, As Slow as Possible, which takes  years to perform. Or maybe even Eh-Oh by the Teletubbies. Any of them might symbolise the mess wersquore in now: the disorder, the ision, the dragged-out damage.To make some sense of it all, it might be useful to remember what Edward Heath thought he had achieved in  as well as the approach he took to some of the controversies that are still with us, such as referendums. Mr Heath said in lsquo that he believed the British people would eventually see the wider benefits of the European Community, particularly peace and prosperity. ldquoI believe they will become convinced that this is where the future of modern Britain lies, he said.For a while, they did, although Ted Heath did have to fight hard to win a majority in the Commons. He also resisted the pressure to hold a referendum, which some said was the only way to avoid the claim that the Government was dragging the country into the Common Market against its will. Mr Heath took a view that now looks impossibly elitist or hugely realistic: in a parliamentary democracy, he said, it would be irresponsible to leave a decision on so critical and complex an issue to the electorate.It obviously wouldnrsquot be easy for a politician to express that kind of view now, but there are lessons for Theresa May to learn from Ted Heathrsquos experiences ndash not easy ones though. Specically, in one respect Mrs Mayneeds to do exactly the same as Ted Heath did, which is to aim for the reasonable centre of the electorate, which still exists and which supports remaining in the EU, a soft Brexit, or some pragmatic compromise.However, it now looks like she can only achieve that result , in another respect, she does exactly the opposite to Ted Heath. Heath thought referendums contradicted the principles of parliamentary democracy ndash and they do ndash but in the circumstances wersquore in, another public vote is the only way to get us away from the extremes of Brexit. In fact, a second vote may end up being one of the few redeeming features of this process by recalibrating us back to where all the good and sensible stuff happens in politics: the centre ground.It is likely to happen because of the logistics of where we are. Theresa May did not ndash and realistically could not ndash stick to her Remain principles when she took over as leader of the Conservative party, but she has achieved the best deal in the circumstances ndash some of which were unavoidable, some of which were self-inflicted.The unavoidable bit was the UKrsquos border with Ireland ndash a hard border is impossible without being a member of the customs union ndash whereas the self-inflicted bit was Mrs Mayrsquos insistence on ending the free movement of people, which ruled out membership of the single market. In this version of our world ndash part reality, part unreality created by Mrs May ndash the deal we have is the only practical option.All of that means that the next few stages in the process are pretty much inevitable. Mrs May is still trying to appease Brexiters by promising that a wonderful free trade deal is still on the horizon but unless we can reach a deal that avoids a hard border in Ireland ndash and no one has come up with one ndash then, under Mrs Mayrsquos plan, Britain will eventually enter the backstop outlined in the withdrawal agreement. Realistically, the backstop is also likely to form the basis of the long-term relationship between the UK and the EU: in other words, a UK-wide customs union with Northern Ireland retaining some elements of the single market.However, we know, and Mrs May knows, that there is no majority in the Commons for that, which leaves only four options: three unlikely and one almost inevitable. The unlikely options are, first, a no-deal Brexitsecond, a re-negotiation of the deal, which the EU has already ruled out whatever Andrea Leadsom says and third, a general election, which neither Theresa May nor any other Tory PM would go for.Which leaves us with the fourth option: another referendum. Ted Heath was right to resist one when he was PM, but  years on, another public vote will soon be Mrs Mayrsquos only choice. She cannot appeal to the right-wing extremists who think the same way about Brexit as some Christian evangelists think about gay-cure therapy ndash that the facts of le can be changed by faith. In insisting on her version of Brexit, she has also ruled out support from the hardcore Remainers and the SNP.However, increating a situation where a second vote on Brexit is now the only option, Mrs May could be doing us all a favour. There is always a chance the result will be another vote for Leave, but the polls show a vote for Remain is increasingly likely. If so, that could help quieten the extremists of all kinds ndash Brexiter, Socialist, Northern Irish Unionist and Scottish Nationalist ndash and take us back to the centre of politics. A good result in a second referendum on Brexit might also achieve a little of what Edward Heath felt in Number  on the evening of th October : a sense that the world is in the right order, a feeling that we are doing whatrsquos best for Britain, and maybe even some longed-for peace of mind."},{"url":null,"title":"community gathers to remember mark","story":"Staff, parents and children of Logie Durno School gathered together on Friday afternoon to pay tribute to a local father.A remembrance event was held for Mark Mathers, who sadly died following an accident at his work on September .The green balloons were released by Marks family and friendsWhile taking part in the remembrance event, pupils wore ribbons that were green - Mark’s favourite colour.School pupils sang a number of songs at the event before Mark’s family released nine green biodegradable balloons.After the remembrance event was over, Mark’s we Deborah and sons Connor, Arron and Blair presented a cheque for £, to representatives of the Grampian Child Bereavement Network .Speaking to the Herald, Deborah said: “The money was raised at Mark’s funeral.The community gathered to watch the balloons float away“After we had the final total myself and Mark’s father thought about what charity we should donate it to.“We looked at ious charites but we thought it made sense to give it to a local charity that was already helping us.“They are the best people for it as they aren’t well known and we want people to be aware of them and what they do.”She added: “The remembrance event was very well done, but it’s tough for the children to fully understand what is going on.“This is such a small community but everyone has shown a lot of community spirt over the last couple of months and the staff at the school have been amazing.Commenting on the donation Jan Sanders of GCBN said: “For us it’s humbling that people going through something so sad like this choose to support us.“It’s an incredible amont to receive and it is a huge privilege to come here today.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amThe new Kirkwall Harbour flood prevention scheme are set to be tested.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Monday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

May has proved she has the cricketer’s staying power, for sure, but not his passion. Her reluctance to leave the stage smacks more of inertia than of any belief in her power to deliver. Watching her make her statement in the House of Commons, as cabinet members and MPs prepared to desert her and opposition MPs hurled abuse, it was that old football chant that came to my mind: “No-one likes us we don’t care.” Except, of course, that when Millwall supporters sang the line it was an expression of defiant solidarity an “us against the world” kind of thing. For May, there is no “us” unless you count her husband Philip, who poured her a whisky after her marathon cabinet meeting. There is only her, ploughing on, never veering from her set course. Like a missile launched into outer space, she seems propelled less by hope or conviction, than by an inability to stop and the lack – so far – of sufficient resistance. Even being compared to appeaser Neville Chamberlain appears to have done little to dint her determination.Has there ever been a lonelier figure in history than May  Macbeth watching the approach of Birnam Wood, perhaps  Or Julius Caesar lured to the Theatre of Pompey by his erstwhile allies  Et tu, Dominic  Et tu, Esther  Et vos, several junior ministers most of us had never heard of  May exudes loneliness the way some people exude vitality. Long before no confidence letters started stacking up, she appeared ill at ease in the company of others, be they members of the public or world leaders. Remember that footage of her at the EU summit in   The one where she fiddled anxiously with her cuffs and searched for someone to talk to, as all around her other attendees greeted each other with hugs and air kisses  I have neither met nor read of anyone who has found in May either a force to be reckoned with or a kindred spirit. Most report her as lacking in presence and conversational gambits. In a rare personal jibe aimed at another woman, Nicola Sturgeon said she found it impossible to get any human connection. As for when May takes on Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs: Denis Healey’s famous jibe about being “savaged by a dead sheep” comes to mind.Bingeing on the latest season of the Brexit box-set is emotionally confusing. What are we supposed to feel for this robotic character who refuses to be beaten, even when she so obviously is  Not admiration. There can be no admiration for a leader whose management of everything from Grenfell to the snap general election has been so spectacularly inept. And certainly not for a leader who, while home secretary, introduced the hostile environment policy that led to the Windrush and other deportations. Respect is wrong too. How can we respect someone so out of touch with the impact of Tory policies that – even as her party is preparing to tip the country off a clf – she thinks it’s amusing to jig her way out to the conference podium  Despite myself, what I did feel for May, last week, was a sort of muted regard for her obstinacy. May is a Remainer who took on the challenge of achieving the unachieveable – a compromise that would suit everyone – presumably because she felt it was a better option than having negotiations conducted by a sovereignty-obsessed Brexiteer. It was an impossible, thankless task and she was undermined at every turn. Nevertheless, she and her civil servants put together a deal. Perhaps it’s a dog’s dinner of a deal perhaps – as Jo Johnson suggested – it will leave us a “vassal state”, but it’s more than any of her blowhard critics have done. And at least she had the guts to face down the DUP on the Irish Border backstop. May’s deal is unlikely to be passed by the House of Commons, but as any deal capable of passing through the House of Commons is unlikely to be agreed by Brussels, she was always on to a loser.Yet, while she is taking all the flak, where is the man who kicked this off this fiasco in a misguided attempt to buy off his party’s right-wingers  At a financial conference in Florida, of course. David Cameron is a shameless dilettante who takes responsibility for nothing. His catastrophic miscalculation has never stopped him sleeping at night. He left No  with nary a backward glance. The same is true of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, who were last week spotted enjoying a cosy drink at an upmarket restaurant, and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who is currently in Washington.Whatever  May lacks – grace, empathy – she does not lack a sense of civic duty. Why  would she plough on, pushing a deal in which she cannot believe to a party that only tolerates her because it doesn’t know what  to do  Anyone  would have packed up long ago and headed for the nearest wheatfield.This is not an endorsement of May’s premiership, which has been characterised by a series of humiliations and mistakes, and an inability to answer questions with anything other than her sound-bite du jour. Her craven cosying up to Trump still makes me queasy.But imagine the resolve it takes to get up every day and face the public when you are assailed from all sides when you know that some of those, like Michael Gove, who have agreed to join your cabinet, have only done so in the hopes of bringing you down from within when you know no gain is ever going to come from all the pain.Imagine putting yourself through all that when you are aware your legacy will be naught. No matter how this turns out, May is going to go down in history as one of our worst-ever prime ministers.When she first became leader, the columnist Marina Hyde rfed on a Katharine Whitehorn quote which asked: “Have you ever taken anything out of the dirty clothes-basket because it had become, relatively, the cleaner thing ” May, Hyde said, was “the cleaner thing.”It was true then and it’s true now. It is a testament to the amorality of almost everyone  involved that the prime minister comes across as a person with a degree of integrity . She is the best of a very bad bunch.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831449.1542541554!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm tory brexit zealots out of touch with reality","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Eurosceptic zealots are as out of touch with reality about ousting the Prime Minister as they were about an easy Brexit, writes Euan McColm.How fitting it was that, as they moved in for the kill on Prime Minister Theresa May, the jackals of the Tory right couldn’t get their story straight. They have form for this, after all.\u2028Conservative Brexiteers and their fellow travellers blithely lied their way to victory in the  EU referendum campaign, making undeliverable promises and insisting that anyone who dared raise legitimate points of concern was part of a cynical plot to undermine democracy. Anyone who says Brexit isn’t going to be easy or that it’s going to damage the UK’s economy – and standing in the global community – is a liar, they lied.And so there was a certain black comedy on Friday when it turned out the organiser of a rebellion aimed at bringing down Prime Minister Theresa May was talking out of his arse.To trigger a vote of no confidence in the PM,  per cent of her MPs must submit letters supporting the move to the  Committee, which represents the views of Tory backbenchers. Early on Friday, the organiser of the current rebellion, Steve Baker MP, said he was confident the threshold had been reached and then some. Not only had more than  Conservative MPs passed letters to  Committee chair Sir Graham Brady, another dozen colleagues were set to join them.Predictably, Baker – a classic Little Englander Eurosceptic wing-nut – wasmistaken.As the day progressed, Brady revised his statement. The truth was that the  threshold had not been met. But it would be, he reckoned, “more likely next week”.It is, of course, true that Baker’s initial statement may – over the next hours and days – come to be true, but on Friday morning, he unleashed some classic Brexiteer bulls**t. Still, we are all sick, as Eurosceptic Michael Gove said in , of experts, so who caresBaker’s facts were anything but Let us say that the hard right of the Tory Party is able to drum up the required number of letters, that  per cent of MPs decide she has to go – that would be the end of May, surely  Evenshe was to survive a confidence vote by securing the support of a simple majority of the Tory Westminster group, she’d be so badly damaged that her resignation would be inevitable. That’s how these things work, isn’t it Under normal circumstances, that would probably be true. But, as is abundantly clear to anyone paying the slightest attention to UK politics, we are not living through normal circumstances.Baker and his fellow extremists, like Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nadine Dorries and David Davis, may indulge a fantasy where a Eurosceptic Tory leader takes over and makes a success of the Brexit disaster they have created, but – as is their way – they haven’t thought things through.The existence of these snakes in the Tory grass is hardly news to the PM. May knows – and has known since succeeding David Cameron in  – that these right-wingers do not support her. For these rebels, this rabble of frauds who claimed two years ago that Brexit would be a breeze, departure from the EU without any kind of deal would be just dandy and to hell with the consequences. They may be about to find out that the majority of their colleagues do not share their enthusiasm for tossing a match on the UK haystack.Success for the Tories’ right-wing nationalists in this instance would not just end the career of the Prime Minister, it would fundamentally change the Tory Party. Just as the victory of Jeremy Corbyn in the  Labour leadership contest moved the opposition towards the hard left, so victory for Baker and his cohorts would drag the Conservatives further right. The result of last year’s general election, in which Corbyn lost to the most chaotic Tory government in living memory, surely tells us thatone wishes to win elections, one should avoid extremism. Compared with Corbyn, May, for all her flaws, appeared the more moderate candidate and the cautious electorate voted accordingly.In the fever dreams of Tory Eurosceptics, former foreign secretary and perpetual charlatanBoris Johnson rides into town and cleans things up. He ruffles his hair, puffs out his chest and tells those foreign sorts they can whistle for any kind of financial settlement, and sets the UK on course for a bright new isolationist future.The slight flaw in this fantasy, as one Eurosceptic MP who’s backing the PM told me, is that a majority of the Tory parliamentary group is unlikely to pass a motion of no confidence in her Eurosceptics may despise May but Remainersfear a Johnson prime ministership would be a disaster. The words of Gove – who may, ironically, be an expert in this area – in , when he withdrew support Johnson’s leadership bid claiming his colleague was unfit to lead the party, still echo. All of this being so, it seems to me that the best possible outcome for May would be for the -letter threshold to be reached. If it is not, then the Eurosceptics on her backbenches will remain a daily problem, working to get the support they need to trigger a vote and – all the time – undermining the Prime Minister.Yes, a confidence vote would be unpleasant but – as seems likely – she were to win it, she would create for herself some breathing space. Under Tory rules, she could not be challenged again for a year, which would give her time – and authority – to try to reach a deal with the EU with which she is,not happy, comfortable.Baker and his right-wing chums strutted around last week asTheresa May’s defenestration was a done deal. In fact, it is far from so.

Scotland has been sidelined.”Andrew Marr replied: “So why don’t you have a second referendum ” Nicola Sturgeon responded: “You will have to wait for that statement – that will not be in the too distant future.”So far, so unremarkable. The SNP leader’s been producing that “wait and see” line since last year’s snap general election. Even though it failed to convince when trotted out in response to Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens during First Ministers Questions last week when he pointed out that waiting for clarity over Brexit might mean waiting forever. Now maybe it’s no bad thing to have folk urging you to move a bit faster towards your constitutional destination of choice. But maybe it’s also a little weird.Commentators north and south of the Border assume the Scottish Government must be close to some kind of announcement on a second indyref, given the degree to which Scotland has been visibly carved out of the Brexit process, denied any whf of the dferential deals that proved possible for Northern Ireland, Gibraltar and Cyprus despite Scots voting more overwhelmingly to stay in the EU. But Nicola Sturgeon and Mike Russell spent the weekend promoting another cause – urging the UK to remain in the Customs Union and stay in the Single Market like Norway and Iceland. Now of course it’s a reasonable enough suggestion. Norway joined the halfway house after two referenda rejected EU membership so they could keep their recently-won political independence but win single market access for their outward facing economy. Access to the single market is not a great solution but it’s a heck of a lot more popular in Norway than full EU membershipor leaving the EU to plough the lonely free trade furrow advocated by Britain’s hard Brexiteers. But there are cultural reasons why single market access can work for Norway but not for Britain. Firstly, the arrangement means being a “rule-taker.” That may be easier for a small country that was never a full EU member in the first place than once “mighty” Britain where the very idea of “rule-taking” prompts overwrought talk about “vassal states”. Secondly, the acceptance of less-than-perfect deals is an everyday occurrence in Norway because it’s had proportional representation since  and thus daily experience of negotiation and compromise. Westminster’s first-past-the-post system, by contrast, breeds a confrontational “no surrender” approach to international relations which would make Britain a very bad fit with the small, consensual EEA nations. Thirdly, membership of the single market means accepting freedom of movement. This doesn’t particularly bother the Norwegians, who were part of a Nordic Travel Area  years before Schengen and joined that club despite remaining outside the EU to make le and travel easier for citizens and neighbours. Sadly though, freedom of movement is a massively big deal for the millions of Britons who voted to leave the EU. So while single market membership may make sense on paper, there’s absolutely no way the closet Brexiteer Jeremy Corbyn or the Ukip-fearing Theresa Maywill ever consider single market membership because it ends the illusion that control over British borders can ever be “taken back”. So, since neither the Tories nor Labour will ever accept this halfway house, why are the SNP still pushing it  Are they virtue signalling – demonstrating that the Scottish Government can embrace a rational solution to Britain’s Brexit problems evenit cannot be stomached by No   If so, why bother It’s hard to see how much more virtue the Scottish Government can possibly accumulate over Brexit. Scottish voters not living on another planet since  are fully aware that we voted to remain, the Scottish Government published an options document a full year before Westminster, political parties here are fairly relaxed about freedom of movement and even Ruth Davidson could support single market access as long as no one from London was watching. Butthis virtuous solution has no hope of being implemented, why does the SNP spend its only moment of UK-wide media continuing to advocate solutions for the whole of the UK when that makes it almost impossible to start making the case for independence As Britain’s constitutional crisis likely deepens this week, every other party will be laying out its stall – whether that is A Peoples’ Vote, A No Deal Brexit, Theresa May’s deal, a Tory leadership challenge or a general election. But Scottish independence is nowhere to be seen. Of course, everyone accepts that naming the date for another referendum is indeed impossible with uncertainty all around. But it seems that worry about naming a date is also stopping Nicola Sturgeon from making a case – and that’s becoming problematic. Scottish voters are being plunged into a Black Friday-style sale of constitutional options and voters are thinking deeply about the future . Does the SNP believe swithering Scots will hold onto their democratic currency, ignore all the whizzy offers being laid before them and keep their powder dry till the Indy Express finally rolls into town  If it takes too long, swithering voters may have ed to the Union fold.So it’s just as well the Greens have decided to move into the unoccupied political space of the Independence moveTiment. Yesterday, Scottish Greens co-convener Maggie Chapman wrote about the need to get updated, Brexit-framed, modern arguments for independence into the public domain as a matter of urgency. SNP MP Mhairi Black made similar points.Many Yes activists are praying the SNP leadership has got over the snap election and will start talking in detail about the independence scenario it exists to promote. If Oscar Wilde is right and the only thing worse than being talked about is indeed not being talked about, then Westminster is actually winning as an institution by being the sole focus of attention right now. Playing it safe can be laudable – but not being a player at a time like this is not an option.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831674.1542578384!/image/image.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn urged to meet nicola sturgeon and form united front for new brexit vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scottish Labour figures have called on Jeremy Corbyn to meet Nicola Sturgeon this week and present a united front to overhaul Theresa May#s deal with Brussels or give the people a chance to reverse Brexit.The First Minister will go to London for talks with politicians working to thwart the Prime Minister’s Brexit plan, and said she hopes to sit down with Labour and others to formulate an alternative. The call for unity came as Mr Corbyn faced criticism for again appearing to play down the prospects of a referendum on the terms of Brexit, claiming it was “not an option for today” and refusing to say how he would cast his ballot in a so-called “people’s vote”. Ms Sturgeon described Mrs May’s draft agreement as a “blindfold Brexit” that lacked clarity on the UK’s future relationship with the EU and confirmed SNP MPs would vote against it in the Commons.“If the House of Commons says we want to go down the road of single market and customs union membership, we want more time to take this back to the people of the UK in another vote, we need an extension of Article  –there is a clear change of direction – then I believe the EU  would be prepared to look at that,” the First Minister said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.“But that means those who don’t want this deal coming together.“Those who don’t think the Prime Minister’s deal is the right way to go have now a responsibility to come together and coalesce around an alternative.“I will seek to have discussions this week with other parties to get us into that position.”The First Minister said she was keen to talk to Mr Corbyn “and whoever ” in the Commons when she visits London.Labour peer Lord Foulkes said the SNP and Labour leaders should meet. “We need to build a broad front on the way forward, which I hope would be a people’s vote,” he said. Scottish Labour MEP Catherine Stihler said: “Support is growing for a people’s vote, and there is an opportunity for Labour to get fully behind this and campaign to stop a reckless and damaging Brexit.“This is a time for strong leadership in the interests of the workers who our party represents.“I encourage Jeremy to engage with other party leaders, including Nicola Sturgeon, to address the Brexit crisis.”East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield said: “For Theresa May to understand that all of the parties that are in opposition are as one on this is useful for her to know.“There is an opportunity there for people to talk… that’s what needs to happen. The time has come to say that [a people’s vote] is what the majority of the country want.”He added: “If ever there was a time for people to start talking, now is it.”Last week Mr Corbyn raised hopes that opposition parties would present a united front when he joined Ms Sturgeon in signing a letter demanding MPs be able to amend the motion that puts the Brexit deal to a Commons vote.However, despite party policy stating that Labour will pursue a second EU referendumattempts to change the deal or force a general election fail, Mr Corbyn poured cold water on calls for Labour to support a people’s vote, saying it was “an option for the future” but “not an option for today”.In an interview with Sky’s Ridge On Sunday, he also told how his party couldn’t stop Brexit “because we don’t have the votes in Parliament to do so.“There was a referendum in , a majority voted to leave the EU, there are many reasons why people voted. “I don’t think you call a referendum and then say you don’t like the result and go away from it. You’ve got to understand why people voted and negotiate the best deal you can.” Asked about calls for a second referendum, Mr Corbyn said: “It’s an option for the future but it’s not an option for today,there was a referendum tomorrow what’s it going to be on, what’s the question going to be ”Asked which way he would vote in such a referendum, he said: “I don’t know how I am going to vote, what the options would be at that time.”The Labour leader will appeal to business to back his plan for a Brexit deal in a speech to the CBI conference in London today.Arguing that Labour can secure a deal with closer ties to the EU market and better protections for workers’ rights, Mr Corbyn will say: “The government is trying to force a bad deal that doesn’t meet our country’s needs by threatening us all with the chaos and serious damage to our economy of a no-deal outcome.“The Prime Minister knows that no-deal isn’t a real option. Neither the Cabinet nor Parliament would endorse such an extreme and dangerous course.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4821909.1542545598!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon decision on scottish independence vote in not too distant future","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has said her MPs will vote against Theresa May#s Brexit plan and that she will make a statement on a second independence vote soon.The First Minister said plans for another referendum on independence would have to wait “until the dust settles”, meaning after a Commons vote on the proposed Brexit deal, and any public vote that could follow.: Richard Leonard: Scottish independence vote would be worse than BrexitUncertainty over the UK’s relationship with the EU has forced Ms Sturgeon to repeatedly delay making plans for second independence referendum - first in the aftermath of a general election setback in , and more recently as Theresa May has struggled to pin down a deal with Brussels.: ‘Scottish independence case stronger after Scotland sidelined in Brexit talks’In October, she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that she would unveil her independence plans at “the end of this phase of negotiations… when Theresa May comes back and says I’ve got the deal”.Appearing on the same programme on Sunday morning, the SNP leader said there was “chaos reigning at Westminster” and a decision would have to wait.“I think it’s firstly appropriate to wait and see what the House of Commons does,” she said.“This withdrawal agreement, as things stand just now, is not getting the approval of the House of Commons.

I think she understands that would be multiplied considerably in the event of her calling for a second referendum.”Leonard says during campaigning for last year’s elections, he detected a growing sense of “hostility” on the doorsteps to the prospect of a second independence vote.“Don’t get me wrong, there were still some people who were very enthusiastic about Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP and independence, but those people who didn’t warm to that were increasingly hostile and I think she understands that,” he says.Despite his party’s sluggish performance in opinion polls at a UK level, the Scottish Labour leader says there should be another general election, one he thinks Corbyn can win.But despite being seen as the Corbynista candidate during last year’s leadership contest, Leonard admits to having what he calls “robust discussions” with his party’s Westminster leader, particularly after Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell’s decision not to oppose tax cuts for higher earners in last month’s Budget.“You can characterise that as a disagreementyou want, it’s certainly a dference in policy,” he says. “We’ve had some robust discussions, but we’ve got a working relationship and I’m not going to go around trying to manufacture disputes in order to demonstrate the dferences we have. “There’s got to be a fresh approach to Brexit. My own view is the best way to achieve that is for there to be a general election. This is a political crisis and there’s a growing prospect of it being a constitutional crisis. That propels us, in my view, in the direction of a general election.“What Labour has said is that we are prepared to consider options. The mandate we would seek would, in my view, be a mandate to renegotiate the terms of Brexit.”During the past year, Yorkshire-born Leonard has had to defend his party’s decision to withdraw funding for former leader Kezia Dugdale’s legal defence in a defamation action brought by pro-independence blogger Stuart Campbell, publisher of Wings Over Scotland. And he was accused of carrying out a “purge” after removing Sarwar and Baillie from his front bench last month. Leonard says that decision was not about “political dferences”, but about trying to “reach out and appeal to voters we need to win back”.He says it is for others to judge his performance as leader, but that his party has made important interventions on issues such as the future of Monklands Hospital in Lanarkshire.“It’s clear that we are starting to make progress,” he says. “A lot of the work we’re doing on reaching out to trade unions and working people and the work we’re doing to build our profile in the communities, we are starting to get a resonance and a traction again. “There’s a long way to go and I’ve always approached this job as a challenge to try and win a battle of ideas. The next Scottish Parliament election is not until , so I’m content there’s still time and we have an opportunity to build up a positive message of hope. We are the only party which is avowedly anti-austerity and we are leading the debate over the ownership of our public services.”Among Leonard’s big ideas are a new industrial strategy that would see smaller Scottish firms championed at the expense of multinationals. According to Labour, foreign-owned firms have received more than £m in Regional Selective Assistance grants from Scottish Enterprise since the SNP came to power, compared with £m for Scottish companies. “We need to move beyond this scenario where we just simply react to crises all the time,” says Leonard. “We need to have a proactive, forward-looking approach to industrial policy … with Brexit, it becomes even more imperative that we don’t just leave things to chance.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831679.1542578471!/image/image.jpg","title":"uk ministers aren t interested in scotland","story":"The UK government is not interested in the views of the Scottish Government or Parliament, according to Scotland#s constitutional relations secretary.Speaking before a meeting of the joint ministerial committee in London, Mike Russell also said he had “little confidence” that UK ministers were “interested in serious talks”.On Thursday the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, and Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote a joint letter to the Prime Minister calling for an urgent meeting of the joint ministerial committee.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed.

Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill!

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison.

He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France. What an oversight !!Too much sauerkraut and champagne probablyto blame.I wondertheir suggestion is in any way due to their much reduced popularity in their respective countries.I would have thought the present EU decision-making structure e.g. nations’ vetoes, is hopelessly incompatible with having its own military, capable of defending Europe against Russia, China and laughably, the US. How much will that cost  It will need massive further integration, possibly, to United States of Europe level , a ghastly spectre that motivated many Brexiteers to vote ‘Leave’. year more than the next seven countries put together at  billion dollars.To say that the E.U. should not work militarily together is preposterous.Europe has been ided by maniacs with delusions of grandeur,their own ego#s and agendas on too many occasions # the last fty years has brought us peace,economic stability and a continent able to feed itself.I am sure WinstonChurchillwould be very proud of that after the hell of World ,he fought like so many others for it and would be appalled at the prospect of Little Englanderism and the new Westminster faith with its no deal brexit nonsense!

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding.

But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed.

On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27497  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinSinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit. - Mary Lou McDonald TDAmid all the chaos in Westminster, there are few certainties as to where the Brexit circus will stumble to next.Brexit began as a squabble between the rich and right wing boys of the Tory party. Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8697291.1541638970!/image/image.jpg","title":"competition winners","story":"The winners of the Johnston Press competition, in association with Ulster Rugby,for family tickets to tomorrow#s night#s special fixture at Kingspan Stadium or Ulster v Uruguay have been confirmed.Each winner received a family ticket for the game, the first time in  years Ulster will have faced international opponents.The winners were: Terry McCorry, Newtownabbey Sarah Walker, PortadownCathal Gilmore, Lford.Congratulations to them andyou were unlucky on this occasion, tickets for the game, which has a .pm kick-off can be purchased at ulsterrugby buytickets£, reward offered in hunt for man who assaulted NI Railways employeeMid and East Antrim prepares to remember the fallen Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

It is not a reflection of politics or religion and it is not red to reflect the colour of blood.The full motion read: That this Council was disappointed to learn of the decision by Cambridge Universitys Student Union to vote down a motion to promote Remembrance Sunday and therefore records its objection to this decision to ignore such a signicant event in our history.Cllr Henry continued, saying: If this is the way our young people have been taught, what hope do we have We as a nation look to our students in the hope that one day they will be our leaders in many walks of le.He also said: When the young people of Cambridge University voted overwhelmingly to de-emphasise the sacrice of the armed forces, thereby striking out any reference to the British war veterans, remembrance day and the poppy they brought untold hurt and suffering to many families who lost loved ones during the wars.What a despicable way to show gratitude to many hundreds of thousands who gave their all so as those students and indeed everyone of us can enjoy the freedom of democracy that we have today.Our freedoms cost many everything they had.It is easy to judge from a distance when you have the luxury of a safe and comfortable democracy.Cllr Henry requested that the council write to Cambridge University to: express their disgust and revulsion at the decision made by the Students Union.

The Right to Welfare Group are calling for a risk assessment to be carried out by social security decision makers and have developed the Peoples Proposal which is a human rights checklist. “The checklist includes the right to due process, including the right to information and representation, presumption of innocence and transparent decision making prior to the appeal stage.”Councillor Hardy spoke passionate about the Peoples Proposal and about the recent benefit changes.She said it is needed because: On average over  financial sanction are issued against unemployed people every month, while  decisions are made on a monthly basis to stop sickness benefits.People are being financially sanctioned first and then appealed afterwards while suffering forced poverty.She gave figures, saying that: , people were forced to use food banks last year, including , children. This isnt good enough.Speaking about children, she said levels of child poverty have continued to increase here.Over a quarter of all children are living in poverty. This is not just a statistic, this is a sad reality. Many children are arriving to school hungry. Every child should have the right to food and every child should be free from poverty. Seconding the motion, fellow Sinn Fein Councillor James McKeown, said: This highlights the disaster that is austerity and changes in the welfare system have brought upon people in our society. He also added: We need a fairer and more professional approach to benefits.UUP Councillor Stephen Nicholl, said: The substance of the motion is absolutely correct. The impact of the changes in welfare delivery are causing a signicant impact in society, especially on those who are the poorest in society.He added: The increasing use of food banks in areas where universal credit has been ruled out, the use of food banks have increased by %.I have seen some horrendous decisions going through. So I think anything that introduces greater clarity and greater consideration of the actualconditions is to be welcomed to try and make this a fairer system.DUP Councillor Billy Ashe said this affected everyone.

Looking after the maintenance of it, the operations of it, all the visitors’ services, and the staff and all that side of things.“Anything that happens on the bridge is my responsibility and it’s my job to make sure it gets sorted out.”Trish Johnson making safety checks on the bridge.Born in Belfast, Trish grew up in Banbridge, attended St Mary’s Primary School and then Banbridge Academy where she completed her A Levels before going on to study engineering at the University of Salford, Manchester.After graduating, she says she “sort of fell into” bridge engineering and maintenance – an industry she has remained in for more than  years.Trish, who is better known to family and friends in Northern Ireland as Patricia, has been bridgemaster at Clton for the past two years. But previously she was in charge of maintenance at the Severn Bridge and the Second Severn Crossingand before that looked after bridges and highways across Wiltshire and Avon.She is the first woman to take on the role of bridgemaster at Clton, but says she isn’t tempted to change her title to bridgemistress.An aerial view of the Clton Suspension Bridge, which spans the Avon Gorge and the River Avon.“It is a historic title so it would be unfair to try to change it. I’m happy with bridgemaster, so I wouldn’t want to try to change the course of history!”Trish manages a team of  people including bridge attendants, visitor centre staff, maintenance workers and administration staff, as well as dozens of volunteers who help out with ious projects.“I really enjoy it. It’s fantastic,” she said. “It is a real honour to be looking after such a historic asset. I’ve been in Bristol  or  years now – a long time since I left Northern Ireland – and the bridge has always been a part of my tours when family have been over, so it’s amazing that I’m actually looking after it now. and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"   and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"  Christmas switch-on and twilight market tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“It is a big responsibility. The bridge itself is over  years old. It is one of the icons of Bristol. We get half a million visitors here every year, so it is my responsibility to make sure the bridge is well maintained, safe to use and that it is there for a long time to come.“It is a historic Grade  listed structure and there are not many historic Grade  listed structures that are still used as a transport asset. We still have four million vehicles cross the bridge every year, so it is a working asset as well as a historical and visitor attraction, so there is a lot to the job and it definitely keeps me busy.”The married mum-of-two admits to being slightly obsessed with bridges, and once even booked a weekend trip to Copenhagen just so she could visit the Öresund Bridge which runs between Denmark and Sweden.Her husband Rob, who works in finance, may not share her passion for bridges, but it seems he’s seen more than his fair share over the years.“When we go on holidays he ends up getting trailed round every bridge,” Trish smiled. “He’s getting used to the bridges by now!”Neither of Trish’s children share her love of engineering either. Her daughter Fiona, , works in marketing, while son Thomas, , is studying economics at university.She says she tried to get them into engineering, without success. But she’s adamant that more needs to be done in the UK in general to encourage young people, particularly girls, to get into science, technology, engineering and mathssubjects.“I think the UK has got the lowest percentage of female engineers in Europe and that’s a sad situation. We’ve probably got about % or less female engineers across the UK, so it is really important that we increase the number of women in engineering. “We need to increase the number of people with engineering skills full stop, but we need to tap in to that whole area of getting girls engaged and interested in engineering,” she continued.“Maths was my big thing. I am one of these geeks really. The problem solving side of things is what I really liked, and still do really, and engineering is perfect for that. There is always a problem you’ve got to sort out, and that’s what gets me out of bed in the morning.“I have done it for  years and I have had a whale of a time and really enjoyed it. It’s not just about getting your hands dirty and the mud and concrete and that side of things, there is so much more to it than that and that’s what we have to try to get across to the youngsters of today.”Trish, whose father Tommy Fee is well known in the Banbridge area for having run\u2028 fitness classes at the local college for more than four decades, has made her le in Bristol and says she has no plans at present tohome to Northern Ireland.“I get drawn back every now and then. I go back to see family and friends. But my husband and kids are here so I don’t think I’ll be moving home just yet, but who knows what we’ll do when we retire.”THE FACTS• The Clton Suspension Bridge opened in . It is a private bridge run by a trust.• The  feet long, ,-tonne structure spans the Avon Gorge and River Avon between Clton in Bristol and Leigh Woods in North Somerset.• The deck of the Grade  listed structure sits  feet above the river.• Its designer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was just  when he was appointed project engineer. • Brunel died in  – five years before the bridge he described as “my first love” officially opened.• Today the bridge serves as a crossing for more than four million vehicles every year.• Vehicle drivers have to pay a £ toll to cross the bridge, and the money goes towards the upkeep of the historic structure.• Trish Johnson, the first female bridgemaster, took over the role in October ."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8537099.1529312918!/image/image.jpg","title":"new park ride facility at fane valley welcomed","story":"Local Alderman Junior McCrum has welcomed the new park and ride facility being built adjacent to Fane Valley in Banbridge.

With a limited number of tickets still available, ‘Em Two Balloons duo Gerard Jordan and Ciarán Nolan told Daily Belfast how audiences can expect all their favourite characters from previous stage outings with a wedding bringing together the West and North of the city for its fairytale finale.“This is the fourth year we have brought ‘Em Two Balloons and their Christmas show to the Roddy’s,” explained Ciarán, “we had great success last year with the Terrible Tragedy of the Twinbrook Turkey and we are back again to tell all about the Fairytale of New Lodge. We had Deck the Falls back in , Turkey last year and now this feels like the completion of part of a trilogy.”“The demand for the shows is growing each year,” said Gerard, “audiences have really taken the characters Ciarán and I play and given us such great support. At the start of November we learned that there are only  per cent of the tickets left at the Mac and people are coming in every day to get their tickets early for the Roddy’s. If there were more days in December we would put on more shows as the demand is there.”“Audiences can expect pretty much what they have experienced before, especially in terms of laughter,” said Ciarán. “There are wedding bells in the air in the production, North Belfast is meeting West Belfast and the introduction of the Glider is bringing our characters East. I mean, what’s the most exotic thing for a Westie  It’s’ getting on the Glider and heading East, seeing Stormont in real le,” he laughed. “The characters Gerard and I have created Jean and Joan, Tablets and Muttley and our two doormen Feargal and Maxi are all there as well. Countess and Winalot, the two dogs, are woofing all the way towards Christmas too. Our bride is played by me and called Mini Driver who is from the Oldpark, Feargal is our groom and the all important wedding prep forms part of the story too.”Gerard spoke of how the hard work has been going on behind the scenes since .“It’s been great how much the audiences have backed us. The real compliment is that the audiences keep growing and this year we’ve added matinees into the Mac, we want to branch out to new audiences each year and will be taking the show to Naomh Éanna on December  as well.”Ciarán said that due to overwhelming demand a handful of dates will be performed after Christmas at Fruithill Bowling Club, Gort Na Mona and St Paul’s GAC on the ,  and  of December. “We will be working on new material for  and ‘Em Two Balloons will be bringing out a new production.

If ratied, this Withdrawal Agreement should provide a degree of certainty to the business community that Northern Irelands economy will ultimately be protected\".Ibec director of policy Fergal OBrien said \"swt ratication is vital\".But Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said it is \"certainly not\" the position that the DUP is risking alienating its key supporters, such as business leaders and the UFU, by opposing the draft Brexit deal. \"Thats certainly not the feedback were getting this weekend. Weve had a lot of support from people who recognise that this deal has the potential to separate us from our business market in Great Britain.\"Its not something that many business people or farmers believe is in the best economic interests of Northern Ireland,\" he said.\"We are clear that this proposed deal breaches a red line for us in that it has the potential to create a border in the Irish Sea and to separate us increasingly from our biggest single market. We believe that will be damaging to the agri-food sector and to the economy in Northern Ireland, so whilst we respect the opinions of the business representatives and of the UFU we disagree with their conclusion and in so doing we know we have the support of many business people and farmers in Northern Ireland who share our concern about this deal.\"He described the \"idea that the DUP stands alone\" in its opposition to the Brexit deal on the table as \"nonsense\".\"The UUP, the TUV, all oppose this deal,\" he said.\"How many votes did the UFU get at the last general election \"The idea that the DUP stands alone in this is nonsense, there isnt a single unionist party so far that has backed this deal, and I have spoken to farmers and business people in my constituency over the weekend who support the stance of the DUP.\"Mr Donaldson also revealed that the DUP is \"inclined to support\" the Finance Bill - the legislation which passes the Budget into law - despite suggestions that his party could withhold its backing to pressurise Prime Minister Theresa May into changing the draft Brexit deal.\"We will of course listen to the debate very carefully and consider any amendments that are brought forward, but in principle the Finance Bill is part of our confidence and supply agreement and as such we would be inclined to support the bill,\" he said.\"The Finance Bill delivers signicant enhancements for expenditure and public services in Northern Ireland, and we need to take that into account.\"Regarding the DUPs support for Theresa May and the confidence and supply agreement which sees the party prop up the Tory government in the Commons, he added: \"The question as to who leads the Conservative Party is a question for that party, not for the DUP.

He said: \"The Irish Republics ambition is to overplay, exaggerate the whole border issue as they did to try and create the leverage to lever Northern Ireland out of its settled position in the UK, in the UK single market.\"And thats what theyve been trying to do from day one, and thats what,Mrs Mays plan is approved, they will achieve in doing. So I dont buy any of the honeyed words from Ms Humphreys - I think they knew what they were doing, and my hope and belief is that they so overplayed their hand that they are the ones that will be sorry in the end.\"If they force a situation where we leave with no deal, leave on World Trade Organisation terms, the Irish Republic is then, as the frontier state of the EU, compelled by EU treaty obligations to provide the border. Thats what the EU treaty requires of a frontier state. \"If we leave with no deal, that obligation will then fall on the Dublin government courtesy of Brussels treaty obligations. The EU treaties say that the frontier state shall provide and maintain the EU border.\"Mr Allister said creating a regulatory border in the Irish Sea was \"wholly incompatible with the maintenance of our position in the UK and in defiance of the notion that there should be no change with consent\" as specied in the Good Friday Agreement."},{"url":null,"title":"creating waves haunting image by belfast telegraphs kevin scott makes headlines","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We are not a party of no deal. However, the deal before us would irreparably damage the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. This is a seminal moment for our nation. We respect everyones right to examine the Prime Ministers draft deal, to interpret it as they see fit and to challenge our views where they feel it is appropriate. However, our position on the proposed deal is in line with what we have said both in private and in public for many weeks. This should come as no surprise to local representatives of business including agri-food.The draft agreement would establish signicant dferences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. In legal terms, Annex  to the Protocol would mean Northern Ireland remaining in EU single market rules for goods, including food standards, while Great Britain is not. Economically it would mean vastly increased checks on food and agriculture products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Practically this creates new barriers for businesses, including supermarkets seeking to fill shelves across our province. Others can choose to frame it dferently but in our eyes such a solution cannot be described as anything other than a border in the Irish Sea. While this paints a picture of immediate disruption - even when UK and EU rules are aligned - the greater unknown of this plan is how that disruption could evolve and growand when the rules between sides erge. Although this deal may give certainty to trade on day one, that certainty is far from guaranteed for months and years down the line. There is no legal guarantee on preventing ergence within the UK internal market during the operation of the backstop. Commitments to best endeavours are not enough.Keeping Northern Ireland in the EUs state aid framework also raises the potential for dferences in support and incentives provided to businesses in dferent parts of the UK. Hospitality Ulster have highlighted fears that the plans could halt Northern Irelands campaign for cutting tourism VAT and abolishing air passenger duty. It is also clear that a new Joint Committee would have the power to restrict the maximum level of future support provided to farmers in Northern Ireland. The deal on the table fails to deliver the referendum result in every part of the UK. It leaves our province subject to the rulings of the European Court of Justice. It creates a democratic deficit whereby Northern Ireland would become subservient to EU legislation with zero representation. In real terms, Dublin legislators would have influence over the rules governing us while elected representatives in Belfast or London would have none. This violates the principle of consent. It also extends the role of the devolved institutions and North-South bodies and grants a Joint Committee signicant input into local affairs. This collectively amounts to a breach the Belfast Agreement. The wording of the draft withdrawal agreement also ensures that Dublin and Brussels hold an active veto on whether the backstop ceases to apply in Northern Ireland in the future. Both options - the review mechanism or extension to the transition period - fail to allow the UK to unilaterally move away from the arrangements should it wish to do so. This could leave us in an indefinite limbo and make it harder to leave the backstop than to leave the EU itself. The ability to supersede the backstop in whole or in part also expresses a danger that Great Britain may be able to leave the backstop but Northern Ireland may have to remain. We would be handcuffed to the EU with Brussels holding the keys. Thats not taking back control.We are not alone in our resolve to oppose the risks this deal presents to the Union. Departing Cabinet members hold to our view that this agreement would break up the United Kingdom. Labour has described it as a de facto border in the Irish Sea. The parliamentary debate in the coming days should not be framed as a binary choice between a bad deal or a no-deal. We believe there is widespread cross-bench support for a deal with the EU - but not this deal. We will not, as some have suggested, step back from our commitments to defend the security of the Union and protect the long-term economic interests of Northern Ireland. Ultimately neither can be guaranteed by this deal and for that reason the DUP cannot in good conscience support it.

Its a real issue and it needs urgent attention.\"Alderman Tom Haire, who supports the operation of -hour bus lanes during the week, said he favours a free flowing road network at the weekend, where all lanes are open to all traffic.\"All traffic needs to be able to access the city centre on a Saturday for the overall economic wellbeing of Belfast - and now would be a good time to make that happen,\" the DUP man said. Independent councillor Declan Boyle said ditching the bus lanes on Saturdays was essential for the citys economic revival.\"Bus lanes are right up there with the cost and dficulty of car parking in Belfast as major deterrents to shoppers,\" he said.\"Bus lanes should only operate at peak times during rush hour and at no other time. Saturdays should definitely be out.\"A Translink spokeswoman said: \"We want to make public transport as attractive as possible and keep the city moving. \"Bus lanes help us bring more people into the city centre and with the launch of our Christmas package this week, including fare offers and special services, bus lanes are an important role in successfully delivering this.\" A spokeswoman said the Department for Infrastructure has invested £m in the Belfast Rapid Transit Glider system in keeping with the draft Programme for Governments aim to encourage people to choose sustainable forms of transport.\"In order for Glider to be successful, the services must be able to operate smoothly along the routes,\" she said.\"The bus lanes are vital to ensure bus services can operate at a high frequency and on time to help guarantee journey time reliability. \"This will in turn make public transport a more attractive option and encourage more people to leave their cars at home.\"Evidence from Translink is that while bus patronage on a Saturday is lower than on weekdays it is still signicantly higher than on a Sunday. \"In addition, bus frequency is similar on a Saturday to that on weekdays. In view of this, and the need for consistency to avoid confusion, it is therefore equally important to have bus lane priority on a Saturday. \"The department recently provided additional funding of £, to enable Translink to deliver a high impact festive campaign, offering major fare discounts and extra services.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"leading northern ireland business organisations back mays draft deal as way ahead but dup is not for moving","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he did not believe it was the best deal for Northern Ireland.It follows days of chaos over the Brexit plan agreed between the UK and the EU.As the fallout continued yesterday:Stephen Barclay was named the new Brexit Secretary as Prime Minister Theresa May set about filling her cabinet after several of her top team quit.Speculation grew that the PMs critics have the numbers required to trigger a confidence vote within days.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar admitted it would be \"very dficult\" to avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann branded the inclusion of the backstop in the withdrawal text as a \"monumental error in judgment\".The proposed deal has sparked chaos within the Conservative Party since it was unveiled on Wednesday. Mrs Mays premiership is hanging by a thread with a series of ministerial resignations and calls from her own MPs for her to stand aside.A vote of no confidence in her leadership could take place as early as next week.The DUP - which Mrs May relies on to stay in power - are also unhappy.Yesterday, however, leading business organisations representing Northern Ireland issued a joint statement in support of the draft agreement.The Confederation of British Industry NI, Federation of Small Businesses NI, Institute of Directors NI and NI Chamber of Commerce said the deal \"provides some much needed clarity that local businesses have been calling for\".\"While by no means perfect, it provides a  to move onto the critical next stage and allows work to begin on the formulation of a comprehensive future trade deal,\" it said. \"Crucially, the provision for an extended transition period offers our members the flexibility and time to adjust to a new relationship with the EU which they must be allowed to do in as smooth and orderly a manner as possible.\"It repeated warnings that a no-deal Brexit would be \"deeply damaging\" and would represent \"a very bad outcome\" for businesses, consumers and the economy.Earlier, the UFU, which represents thousands of farmers, many of whom would traditionally vote DUP, called on the party to vote for the text.UFU chief executive Wesley Aston told the Nolan Show: \"We want to make sure we avoid a no-deal situation. No deal for Northern Ireland agri-food and farming in particular would be absolutely disastrous and we have made that patently clear over this last while.\"He added: \"We would support the deal going through and against that background we would ask the DUP to consider voting for this deal.\"UFU president Ivor Ferguson told the Belfastindependent reports had concluded that a no-deal Brexit would have disastrous consequences for farm businesses and the economy here.He said: \"Ultimately, we would have preferred a UK-wide solution. However, this agreement does provide an insurance policy to prevent a no deal outcome.\"Brian Irwin, chairman of the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association, also hailed the draft withdrawal agreement, saying it \"provides a way to deliver a smooth exit and an orderly transition to the future relationship with Europe\".But speaking to the Belfast , Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the DUPs view of the deal has not changed.\"We very much respect that there are people within the business community and farming who have a dferent view to us on Brexit, and indeed many of them campaigned against Brexit in the first instance,\" he said.\"Therefore it comes as no surprise that they would want to support a deal that keeps Northern Ireland locked into the EU in terms of both customs and the single market.\"While we respect their opinion, we disagree with their conclusion that this is the best deal we can get for Northern Ireland. We believe that a border in the Irish Sea is not in the interests of either our farmers or our business owners, because Great Britain is by far our biggest and best market.\"It is our view that anything that creates barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in economic terms is not good for our economy.\"Earlier, the Lagan Valley MP faced criticism over comments on the BBCs The View when he was asked to respond to comments supporting the deal from the UFU and the Northern Ireland food and drink sector.\"I dont believe they have read the detail of this, they have not read the  pages,\" he had said.Ian Marshall, a former UFU president turned Irish senator, accused Sir Jeffrey of being \"disrespectful\"."},{"url":null,"title":"middleaged men worst for harassing female staff says chef clare smyth","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU Customs Union not the UK’s.\"The North Belfast MP said that there was still time to get a good deal for the UK.\"I understand why some people fear a “no deal” scenario.  But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right deal.\"With MPs on all sides of the House pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom”UUP leader Robin Swann has also been critical of the proposed withdrawal agreement.He said his party \"cannot and will not\" support the draft deal.Mr Swann claimed the proposed plan will see Northern Ireland \"potentially drt farther away\" from the United Kingdom.\"In the unlikely event that the agreement makes its way through Parliament, its impact will be felt for decades to come,\" he said.The Confederation of British Industry NI, Federation of Small Businesses NI, Institute of Directors NI and NI Chamber of Commerce said the deal \"provides some much needed clarity that local businesses have been calling for\".The idea that it’s the DUP v everyone  is nonsense. There isn’t a single unionist party in Northern Ireland that so far supports this Brexit deal.

Afterwards, she told this newspaper she believes parents must be informed of all their options when they are given such tragic news.\"When we were given our diagnosis we were told on at least four occasions that we could have a termination - but there was a lot less information about the perinatal care that was available to us and thats something I cant get over,\" she said. \"I do feel thatother mothers knew what care was out there, maybe it would make a dference.\"The doctors say, A lot of women in this situation would opt for a termination. Buteveryones rallying for choice then they should know what options they have to choose from.\" She added: \"At least we now know more about what memories we can make about Freya, and keepsakes. At the time of diagnosis I think its very important to be given all of your options.\"I knew from the get-go that a termination wasnt an option for me, but theres only so much you could do and say to us unless youre really trained for that. \"A proper support mechanism needs to be in place for anyone going through the same thing as us. You need to be told everything at the time of diagnosis as opposed to being sent home to think about it having been given basically no information at all.\"Erin says shes grateful for the unstinting support of her mother, Winred, who told her: \"We will love this little baby no matter what.\"Anencephaly is a fatal birth defect which occurs when the unborn babys neural tube doesnt form properly.Erin desperately wants to carry Freya to full term but she has a condition called polyhydramnios, a build-up of fluid in the amniotic sac, and she said that means she could experience a premature labour.Still, shes taking things \"day by day\" and she said Freyas baby shower \"definitely lted my spirits\" as well as raising vital funds for a worthy cause.Around  people attended the event in the Limavady bar Granny Annies. \"It was mostly friends and family but a lot of people popped in,\" Erin said.\"We had a bucket on the way in to the baby shower so people could just throw in money. We had a raffle as well. We had so much to raffle, such as vouchers, because so many people had given us stuff.\"Most of the money will go to Every Le Counts, a support network for families whose unborn child is diagnosed with fatal foetal abnormalities, but £, is for anti-abortion group Precious Le and there will be some for another support group, Shine.\"Im feeling a bit better about myself since we had the baby shower,\" Erin said.\"Weve managed to raise money and awareness and we had a really good time doing it so weve actually managed to make light of such a dark situation. \"Were happy with that. It doesnt take away the pain or frustration but the fact that weve been able to do that is really good for our moods. Its just so good to give something back.\"Erin has back pain at present and is \"having dficulty getting around\" but shes been bolstered by the messages of support shes been getting from all corners of the globe.\"Its lovely that so many people have contacted us,\" she said. \"The response has been unbelievable. People are following my story across the world - from as far away as America and Australia.

It was more of a worry for my parents when I was diagnosed but it’s just part of everyday le now and as long as I stay on track managing it should be fine.”Harry is one of around seven pupils at his school with diabetes and as well as supporting each other they have the added support of classroom assistant Anne Beattie, the diabetes champion at St Joseph’s Boys’ School in Derry, who knows the complexities only too well as she is also Type , and staff member Rosin McLaughlin is always on hand to help as well. Harry knows how vital it is to check his blood sugar levels regularly and keep track of the carbs and he wears an insulin pump which he administers himself when required.Speaking ahead of World Diabetes Day on November th, the teenager said that while he had missed a lot of P and P following his diagnosis, there was now better awareness in schools about diabetes and help with monitoring blood sugars.He also reassured any young people newly diagnosed with the condition that they can still pursue the same hobbies as their friends, including competitive sports.Like most lads his age, Harry enjoys playing football, is also a good swimmer and golfs twice a week.

He loves ‘The Apprentice’ and is a big fan of Sir Alan Sugar so hopefully he will start working here at  to gain some experience.”Currently, there are , people living with either Type  or Type  diabetes in Northern Ireland, and this figure is on the rise, making the need for education and awareness surrounding the condition more important than ever.People with Type  diabetes cannot produce insulin. About  per cent of people with diabetes have Type . No-one knows exactly what causes it, but it’s not to do with being overweight and it isn’t currently preventable. It’s the most common type of diabetes in children and young adults, starting suddenly and getting worse quickly. Type  diabetes is treated by daily insulin doses – taken either by injections or via an insulin pump. It is also recommended to follow a healthy diet and take regular physical activity.Jillian Patchett, National Director of Diabetes UK Northern Ireland, welcomed the partnership with Click Energy which included funding for pilot programmes including a new role for Connections Ambassadors to provide help and support in diabetes clinics and also the  Diabetes Volunteer Inspire Awards.She added: “The theme of World Diabetes Day  is Family. We know how important it is to have a network of family, friends, colleagues, class mates and healthcare professionals who are all there for support when it’s needed.

raised after residents of a street in Derry waited nine hours to have power restored to their homes after an underground cable was damaged.The incident happened at the Paddock Lane area in Ballyarnett at pm on Friday, which resulted in a number of homes experiencing a power loss.However, concerns have now been raised that it took NIE nine hours to restore power, given that many of those who live in the area are elderly.Commenting, the independent councillor for the area, Warren Robinson, said that while he understands that certain circumstances could delay power being restored, he was nonetheless concerned at how the issue was handled by NIE.“I was made aware of the problem after being contacted by some residents who were affected. “Concerns were raised in particular because this area houses a large proportion of elderly residents. “I immediately contacted NIE and was informed that a third party contractor had damaged a cable in the area and was told that a repair team were on site but NIE could not give me an estimate for when the fault would be repaired.”Cllr Robinson added: “I understand that sometimes circumstances may mean there is a delay in having repairs carried out but electricity was off in this area for ten hours and my concern would be that elderly residents were left with no information and no offers of help from NIE.”“NIE do have a duty of care to these

The spokesperson continued: “We do endeavour to provide our customers with information where possible, however, it was dficult to provide an exact time for restoration on this occasion due to the unforeseen nature and complexity of the fault, as well as the safety required to undertake the repairs. “This was further compounded by our engineers operating in adverse weather conditions.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges. Such a body would provide the business community with a much-needed voice on a range of important issues.The series of roadshows to discuss parking charges moved to The Lodge in Castlewellan and the Newcastle Centre last night and takes place next Tuesday, November , at Ballynahinchrsquos Market House between .pm and .pm, before later moving to The Hub in Saintfield between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Symbolic lantern walk rekindles time WWI ended  ","story":"A SPECIALLY designed beacon was lit in Killyleagh on Sunday night to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.Local man Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, , one of Northern Irelandrsquos last survivors from the Second World War, lit the gas beacon of light at the front of Killyleagh Castle to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent.Mr Charters was accompanied by two local schoolchildren, Zac Gordon, from St Maryrsquos Primary School, Killyleagh, and Louise Craig, of Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The cross-community event was attended by more than  people at the end of Remembrance Sunday.The eveningrsquos events began with a lantern walk from Shrigley to Killyleagh.

worlds brexit","story":"The author of a report, \"Brexit at the Border\", has said that the ldquopressure is on our political parties especially those with the influence of the DUPa \"best of both worlds\" brexit is to become a reality.Dr Katy Hayward, who is a Reader of Sociology at Queens and who has  years research experience on the impact of the EU on the Irish border and peace process, was responding to an article penned by DUP leader Arlene Foster in last weekrsquos Impartial Reporter.In that article Mrs Foster laid out what the ldquobest of both worlds would be for Northern Ireland, which included full access to UK single market, full access to the EU single market, and full access to future UK and EU trade deals.Mrs Foster said that no-one has offered this ldquobest of both worlds to Northern Ireland but Dr Hayward claims that it is possible but onlythe ldquoUK remains closely aligned to the EUrsquos single market andit stays in a customs union with the EU.Dr Hayward does not see a smooth path to any such scenario however.ldquoBut, as Mrs Foster is well aware, the most vocalMPs in the Tory party want the UK to have a far more remote relationship with the EU after Brexit. If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Politicians  Do we really care tuppence for them just now  Haven’t we seen and heard enough of them spitting venom over the ‘disaster’ ahead  Surely Brexit cannot be more important than the children in Yemen, dying daily in a ghastly war which shows no sign of abating, a war which like the one in Syria could go on for years  In the middle of the Christmas preparations we are faced with many such tragedies. But Brexit is dferent. It’s a war of bickering, a war destined to open up all our political weaknesses, a war which for the Irish and Northern Irish in particular is alarming in its bitterness and the need to settle old scores.Brexit is a drawn out battle we could have done without and I for one never imagined it would put a ‘damper’ on Christmas, a time of year when the charitable gene in us is thinking of other things and people. But politicians have hard hearts. Do they know it’s Christmas and do they care At this time each year we have Children in Need, which the UK as a whole continues to generously support. Going back much further to the s we had Band Aid, an event which really did capture the imagination thanks to the efforts of a pop star Bob Geldof Ben Lowry: Theresa May has ruthlessly but reluctantly felt she had to jettison unionism in Northern IrelandThe defeat of the EU withdrawal deal is the first imperative Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Yet, despite all our efforts children in many parts of the world continue to endure war and famine and what more can we do about it Regularly we put our hands in our purses in response to television and newspaper appeals but still it doesn’t appear to make much of a dference.Charities target us especially in the run-down to Christmas and I have no problem with that. In fact giving to charity is part of Christmas. Appeals are what we expect at this time of the year and people give generously. Our charity shops are full of beautul festive cards and gts to buy and many of us contribute in this way.But Brexit is getting in the way of all the festive spirit which can do so much good for those who need help. The politics of it all has me sapped, fed up, angry and vowing, at one stage, never to vote for a politician ever again. Did we get our fingers bitten back in the s when we signed up for the Common Market  Did we ever think when we signed then that we would end up being bossed around by a cabal of politicians speaking with foreign accents who dare us to withdraw from the ghastly behemoth they created due to our own politicians not reading the fine print or having the brains to see the problems that might arise in our attempt to extricate ourselves.Here I am in the midst of wondering what height my Christmas tree should be, distracted by the possibility that Sinn Fein could well be celebrating that their wildest dream of a united Ireland may be that bit closer come December. My mind is also distracted by the worry that the DUP, their reputation as kingmakers long gone, will be outwitted by the English politicians who really don’t give a toss about us and would gladly see us unhooked and driven into the Irish sea leaving them to become little England again.Soon I will dispatch Himself into the roof space to unearth the Christmas decorations an event I usually celebrate with a glass of my home made sloe gin. But Brexit is well and truly knocking the Christmas spirit out of me. try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all. I would like to thank her for writing the book - especially with the personal things.The book is pound at www.jamessommerinrestaurant. co.uk  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Stud-1.jpg","title":"plans to build  new homes in co antrim","story":"Posted on Wednesday  November  by John Mulgrew Around , new homes could be built in Co Antrim in one of the largest developments to take place here in the last few years, it can be revealed. Plans have now been submitted to construct the homes close to Sprucefield, outside Lisburn. It would also involve a new link road on the M motorway. An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission. Nuport Developments has been given the early go-ahead for  houses on the -acre site at Ballyboley in the town.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
