[{"url":null,"title":"Retail sales plummeted FIFTH April amid coronavirus lockdown","story":"Share this article The April drop followed the previous fall of 5.2 per cent in March compared to February. The volume of goods sold by household stores fell 45.4 per cent, on the back of an 8.7 per cemt drop from February to March.The proportion spent online rose to 30.7 per cent in April, the highest on record, up from 19.1 per cent over the same month last year.Almost all store types saw record online spending in April, the ONS said, as many retailers shifted to online-only trading.The only sectors to see an increase in volume of sales last month were non-store retailing such as online and catalogue businesses, up 18 per cent on the previous month, and off licences.Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said: \u0027The effects of Covid-19 have contributed to a record monthly fall in retail sales of nearly a fifth.\u0027Fuel and clothing sales fell significantly while spending on food also dropped after the surge from the panic buying seen last month. Off-licence sales, however, continued to increase.\u0027Online shopping has again surged as people purchased goods from their homes.\u0027Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, said: \u0027The UK\u0027s first full month of lockdown measures exposed a sharp ide in retail, not only between those in food and non-food, but also between online and in-store sales as physical shops closed.\u0027Food sales volumes have fallen this month, down 4.1 per cent, as initial consumer stockpiling eased and supply chains caught up with the increased demand. \u0027However, in a significant jump, online food sales now account for 9.3 per cent of all food sales, testament to the ability of supermarkets to pivot supply chains and boost their online platforms to manage more home deliveries.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus Mortgage holiday scheme extended THREE MONTHS","story":"Share this article \u0027That’s why we’re working with the banks and lenders to extend payment holidays if people need them.\u0027Everyone’s circumstances will be different, so when homeowners can pay some or all of their mortgage, they should work with their lender on a plan but if they are still struggling, I want them to know that help is there.\u0027New draft guidance for lenders on how the Government expects them to proceed and the options available to customers was today published by the Financial Conduct Authority. Options include extending the application period for a mortgage holiday until October 31. That means that homeowners who have not yet had a payment holiday but who are now experiencing financial difficulty will be able to request one.Meanwhile, an existing ban on the repossession of homes will be continued to the same date. Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA, said: \u0027Our expectations are clear – anyone who continues to need help should get help from their lender.        \u0027We expect firms to work with customers on the best options available for them, paying particular attention to the needs of their vulnerable customers, and to provide information on where to access help and advice.\u0027Where consumers can afford to re-start mortgage payments, it is in their best interests to do so. \u0027But where they can’t, a range of further support will be available. People who are struggling and have not had a mortgage payment holiday, will also continue to be able to apply until 31 October.\u0027 The new guidance will come into effect after a short consultation with lenders who will then be expected to contact customers whose mortgage holiday is coming to an end.For those who are unable to restart full payments they could pay a proportion of the monthly amount or temporarily switch to an interest only mortgage. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ecb5b8afbb1197d37d96eeef53be51485a0c039/0_731_1413_847/master/1413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa2bcfd7797daa793c7c3f3ff6a70b99","title":"its brought home the value of these roles lockdowns private sector heroes","story":"When the UK population was told to stay indoors, one maintenance team in Chester refused to let people in need of vital supplies go without. Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

As an eight-year-old, she said, older boys would wait for her after school, “fill bubblegum wrappers with mud and get me down and shove them into my mouth and say, ‘That’s what you should eat, because you’re from a mud hut,’ and then I’d get beaten up.”Kay, who won the  fiction prize for her novel Trumpet and was awarded an MBE for services to literature in 2006, was being interviewed by the STV Player series In Conversation with Bernard Ponsonby.She did not blame the children who bullied her for their racism, she said, telling Ponsonby that “children are not really racist it’s their households, and it’s the teachers … The teachers at my school often came out with out-and-out racist things. They’d talk about ‘darkies’ or say to me, ‘Oh you should be good at this one, because your people have it in their blood,’ if we were doing a dance,” she said. “It’s endemic racism, something that is in the very structures and fabric of our society. I remember the Enoch Powell Rivers of Blood speeches in the 70s and friends of mine saying, ‘Yeah they should all be sent back – oh, not you Jackie – but they should be sent back,’ so adults are saying things like that, too.”Scotland has changed dramatically, Kay said, although people still regularly ask about her roots: “Even just the other day, this taxi driver said, ‘Where are you from?’ and I said Glasgow and he went, ‘Oh, how do you explain that tan?’ … The image of a Scottish person isn’t me, and I think that we need to try and change what we think of when we think of a Scottish person.”She had, she told Ponsonby, been on “an extraordinary journey”, from feeling she didn’t belong as a child, to being the makar. On a recent trip to Uist, she said, there was a “massive” crowd to see her, and she mentioned to the woman driving her around that she hadn’t expected “the huge lesbian turnout”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5cf8e67c65ad3b1608c8c64fbec30398697dca5/0_134_2217_1330/master/2217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b98bf80db24d7e716ac031ac7a24115","title":"tv account of 1970s feminist history not very good says gloria steinem hay festival","story":"In interview for Hay festival feminist writer says Mrs America misrepresents equal rights movementIt stars Cate Blanchett and Rose Byrne in a glossy, big-budget TV account of 1970s feminist history but one key player who was there, Gloria Steinem, is withering: it is ridiculous, undermining and just not very good, she said on Friday.Steinem, arguably the world’s most famous feminist, has revealed she is not a fan of the new Hulu TV show Mrs America, which premiered in the US last month and is coming to BBC2 in the UK later in the year.The show stars Byrne as Steinem and Blanchett as her rightwing nemesis, Phyllis Schlafly, who is seen leading the fight against the equal rights amendment.Steinem was due to make her first appearance at the Hay festival this year. Now cancelled, she is one of the first interviewees for a reconvened online version, speaking to the writer Laura Bates on Friday about her new book, The Truth Will Set You Free, But First It Will Piss You Off!Steinem was asked for advice on how to deal with women who were not feminists and perpetuated sexism.They existed, Steinem said. “But what is important to remember is, though women may be a problem for other women, they don’t have the power to be the big problem. Women may be adversaries, but we don’t have the power to be our worst adversaries.“For instance, there’s now a not very good series here called Mrs America and it gives you the impression that … Schlafly, who was a very religious and rightwing woman who opposed the equal rights amendment … it gives you the impression that she was the reason it was defeated.“In actuality, I don’t believe she changed one vote. Nobody could ever discover that she changed even one vote. The insurance industry here opposed the equal rights amendment because if they stopped segregating their actuarial tables it would cost them millions upon millions of dollars.”Schlafly was someone “brought in at the last minute” to make it seem that women opposed equal rights when the truth was “the vast majority” always supported it, Steinem said.“The series makes it seem as if women are our own worst enemies, which keeps us from recognising who our worst enemies are. Not that we aren’t in conflict, yes we are in conflict, but by and large we don’t have the power to be our own worst enemies.”Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, said the media often set up debates with token women, seeking to create a “cat fight as a means of undermining feminist argument”.Steinem agreed. “That’s the problem with this ridiculous television show. I’m sure the actors in it are fine, it’s just the thrust of the story is the problem.”Mrs America was created by the former Mad Men writer and producer Dahvi Waller, who has stressed it is not a biopic of Schlafly or Steinem. It also stars Uzo Aduba as Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress and Tracey Ullman as Betty Friedan, the author of The Feminine Mystique.Steinem, 86, talked about the importance of feminists of all ages working together. “Segregating by age is as ridiculous and destructive as segregating by race or class or gender or anything else. We learn from each other. We need each other.”Bates said she still found girls in schools who felt they were a lone feminist voice. “There are these girls everywhere who think that they are the only one and who are on the verge of giving up and who feel completely defeated and are lambasted by their peers … they are called feminazis, they are made fun of, they are ridiculed.”What would Steinem’s message be to those girls?“I would say to her … trust that voice inside you and find a listener and a friendly voice somewhere. Maybe you’re not finding it in your classroom but maybe there is somebody in your neighbourhood, just somebody you feel drawn to. Talk to that person … Trust your own wisdom.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88e44a5839f86badd862f497b2d2bcb99d4f623a/0_279_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c17f7a2e0836e25a7264b1e9db0afc8d","title":"beer brewers carlsberg and marstons announce uk merger","story":"Smaller breweries warn deal could harm independent beer firmsDanish brewer Carlsberg and British pubs and cask ale firm Marston’s have announced a joint venture, prompting concern among small brewers who fear being squeezed out of the market.The new business will offer a mix of Carlsberg’s mass-market lagers and Marston’s cask ale brands such as Hobgoblin and Pedigree, and will also be able to feed Carlsberg beers into Marston’s estate of around 1,400 UK pubs.The Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA), the trade body representing small breweries, warned the deal could make it harder for independent beer firms to get their beers into pubs.“This merger is the latest in a series of consolidating measures within the UK beer market,” said SIBA chief executive James Calder.“It has the potential to take the Marston’s brand global and brings Carlsberg back into the distribution and porterage business only after a few short years of leaving it. This merger yet again has the potential to impact negatively on small independent brewers by further reducing the access to market they receive.”Despite the growth of craft beer in the UK over the past decade, small breweries have struggled in the face of a fightback from global brewing giants, some of which have sought to cash in on changing tastes by buying out smaller operators.These include Carlsberg’s own takeover of London Fields, as well as Heineken’s investment in Beavertown, and the deal that triggered a wave of buyouts – Budweiser owner AB InBev’s deal for Camden Town Brewery.Carlsberg’s group chief executive Cees ‘t Hart said the deal would bring customers “wider choice, greater capacity, product innovation and marketing and distribution efficiency benefits”.The chief executive of Marston’s, Ralph Findlay, said: “This new partnership acknowledges Marston’s strategy, position and consistent outperformance against the UK beer market, realising value for shareholders today, whilst retaining an interest in the future upside of the combined entity.”Analysts at stockbroker Jefferies described the joint venture as “attractive”, pointing to benefits including one-off synergies of £32m and annual savings of £24m by the end of the venture’s third year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a2cd097883022fff3b87f1f6bf0c213b08f22b0/0_185_5551_3331/master/5551.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7129c99ce3cbf69664d3240d502e6e09","title":"ikea reopen stores uk lockdown furniture covid 19","story":"Britain’s biggest furniture chain installs Covid-19 safety measures for 1 June reopeningIkea is to reopen 19 stores in the UK on 1 June as it joins other furniture retailers planning to unlock their doors this weekend.Only one adult and one child per household will be permitted in branches on each visit, while play areas and restaurants will remain closed.The Swedish retailer’s food market will offer takeaway hotdogs, burgers and meatballs from its bistros.Other measures to ensure safer trading during the coronavirus outbreak include “social distance wardens” to help shoppers navigate a new one-way system.Britain’s biggest furniture chain said its smaller high street stores would not reopen yet, and its outlet in Coventry would remain permanently closed with the potential loss of 352 jobs.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..In areas where seating is dense, protective screens will be erected to create a barrier between tables there will also be screens at the till.Staff will be given gloves, masks and goggles, although they will not be required to wear them. They will also be subject to daily health questionnaires and a health check using a digital thermometer. Workers will hold glasses at the base when they deliver drinks to tables.Where possible, each pub will have separate entrance and exit doors, with markings on the floor to guide any customers who become confused.Customers will also be asked to use the Wetherspoon app to order food to their table, or pay with contactless cards, although cash will be accepted.The JD Wetherspoon chief executive, John Hutson, said: “We have spent a number of weeks consulting with staff who work in our pubs, as well as area managers in order to draw up our plans.“We have received more than 2,500 suggestions from our staff. The safety of our staff and customers is paramount.”Martin has previously played down the risk of Covid-19 transmission in pubs but later changed his mind, saying the government’s decision to keep pubs shut was “fair enough”.The BBPA said larger pubs were likely to have an advantage in being able to show that physical distancing can be maintained.Wetherspoon’s pointed to the average 4,000 sq ft floor space of its venues and said almost 700 of its 867 UK pubs have a beer garden, roof terrace or patio."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b4a3810205e1fb2a282410e6ab3af14f4dbfde4/116_0_5830_3500/master/5830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b6e271cb7d90a880b9c2a93fb5f8f7f","title":"the guardian view on climate and covid time to make different choices","story":"Despite some fine words about the environmental crisis, ministers are pushing ahead with a trade bill that threatens to damage the planet Almost 90 years ago the US president’s response was not to lie about the scale of disaster or blame others. Instead, Franklin D Roosevelt launched one of his New Deal’s signature relief programmes: the Civilian Conservation Corps. Its mission was to put unemployed Americans to work. More than 3 million people planted 3bn trees, built shelter belts across the Great Plains to reduce the risk of dust storms, and created 700 state parks. FDR’s legacy survives, but his policy is venerated more in name than in deed.That needs to change. The world faces mass unemployment caused by the Covid crisis and a climate emergency which could spell the end of humanity. But there is no sign in the UK of the effort required to combine our need for jobs with the pursuit of alternatives to fossil fuels and a concomitant reduction in greenhouse gases.The coronavirus pandemic and the environmental crisis share the same roots: humans’ success as a species in arrogating global resources for themselves and the consequent ecological disturbance. This is increasing viral exchanges – first from animal to human, then from human to human – on a pandemic scale. Our environmental footprint is too large for the planet, leading to accelerated species extinctions and atmospheric chaos. Both the Covid and climate catastrophes are not misfortunes that befell us. They are part of a pattern of decisions that we humans are taking. We need to make different choices.These are fine words. But we must judge the government on its actions. There’s no sign that cabinet ministers are pushing to transition to a cleaner world with a Green New Deal or seeking to emulate FDR in putting the jobless to work in conservation. We ought to be importing production techniques that emit fewer greenhouse gases and strengthen food security. Instead we are opening up to foreign businesses that may do the opposite.Liz Truss, the trade secretary, appears to want to agree a deal with Washington that could see the UK accepting imports of climate-unfriendly US factory farming that it previously rejected, or letting American-made cars that emit higher levels of CO2 on to Britain’s streets. Trade deals that privilege industrial competitiveness without taking into account the cost of carbon provide a strong incentive for Britain to offshore greenhouse gas emissions to meet its net-zero target.The absence of politically powerful interests outside of business pushing for global cooperation over health or the environment is a concern. The threat of a boycott by British supermarkets helped derail a Brazilian law that could enable the faster destruction of the Amazon rainforest, a planetary rampart against the rise of future zoonotic diseases. But MPs sit powerless to vote on such matters. Under government plans the Commons won’t have oversight of, or votes on, trade deals. Instead, after the Brexit transition ends, ministers gain unchecked powers over trade.The size, speed and scale of action provoked by the Covid-19 outbreak show what is possible if governments can set aside short-term thinking. Ministers must adopt the same approach to the climate emergency. They should drop beggar-thy-neighbour policies and back meaningful ways to enforce rules for global green goods – or else the government will be pushing a form of globalisation that diminishes the chances of human survival."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e33d1dfd9eb9b8d20dd3224de90d665953fca23/0_175_5251_3151/master/5251.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6db5b8313e8e60c9573a20f2d73e6554","title":"ministers rejected school reopening plan recommended by sage experts","story":"Documents reveal that PM’s current plan was not among those modelled for scientistsSchool leaders said the government’s publication of scientific advice failed to make a convincing case for the early reopening of schools in England, as the government’s chief scientific adviser said an effective testing and tracking system was necessary for more pupils to return to the classroom.After pressure from teaching unions, the government published 12 documents presented to its Sage committee of scientific advisers looking at the effect of coronavirus on children and how schools could safely reopen to more pupils.But union leaders said they found little in the documents to reassure staff or parents that reopening primary schools in England by Boris Johnson’s stated target of 1 June was a safe decision.Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union said the evidence was “inconclusive”, while Geoff Barton, leader of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the government “must be able to show very clearly that its five tests have been met before it gives the green light to any wider opening from 1 June”.Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said on Friday that Sage had been very clear that an effective “test, track and trace” mechanism was necessary in the event of schools reopening, and the sooner in place the better in order to make changes to England’s lockdown.Roach said it remained his union’s view that no schools should reopen more widely until it was safe to do so, and that the publication of the Sage documents would only add to the uncertainty.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said the Sage papers showed that “the phased, cautious return of a limited number of pupils to classrooms has been a carefully considered decision based on the best scientific and medical advice”.“My department continues to engage with the school, college and nursery sectors and I am enormously grateful for all the planning and preparation they are doing, alongside local authorities and academy trusts,” Williamson said.A number of local authorities have said their maintained primary schools will not be ready to reopen, while others – including Staffordshire county council, which covers Williamson’s own constituency – have left the decision up to inidual schools.The papers revealed that a low-risk scenario where pupils in England would attend school on alternating weeks was presented to the government as the most likely way to gain popular support, before ministers instead settled on their plan for a widespread reopening on 1 June.The government’s plan for reopening schools to entire classes of reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 1 June was not among the nine scenarios modelled for Sage by the Department for Education. But one of the scientists’ preferred options of splitting classes and having pupils rotate between alternate weeks in school, which they said had “particular potential merit”, was passed over.Advice favouring rotating pupils between different weeks has since been explicitly rejected by the government. Official guidance from the Department for Education states that primary schools “should not plan on the basis of a rota system, either daily or weekly”.Collectively, the scientific advice appears to do little to assuage fears among parents and teachers over the potential risks in reopening schools to reception, year 1 and year 6 as soon as 1 June. On Thursday the governments of both Scotland and Northern Ireland announced that schools in those countries would not return until after the summer holidays, while Wales has ruled out a 1 June reopening.A modelling paper stated: “The modelling consistently suggests that resuming early-years provision has a smaller relative impact than primary school, which in turn has a smaller relative impact than resuming secondary schooling. However, this analysis does not incorporate potential for indirect impacts on contacts outside of school – which may differ by age of child.”The modelling of infection spread – carried out by four institutions, including Public Health England – also did not account for the activities of children within schools: “It is important to understand what is going on inside of the school (eg physical distancing, hygiene measures, and more). The potential effect of such actions is not incorporated into the modelling.”Sage looked at the modelling for nine different scenarios outlined by the Department for Education, from total closure to full reopening. But none of the published scenarios included the three year groups that the government eventually chose.The committee that examined the modelling appeared to favour two scenarios that would have split both primary and secondary school classes and have different groups of children attend on alternate weeks, labelled scenario seven, which would have seen a low level of potential transmission according to the four results.The recent paper on modelling continued: “Scenario 7 (alternating onetwo weeks on, onetwo weeks off) may be a good way to stop extensive transmission chains in schools. When this effect in schools is embedded into the wider community, the impact is less strong, but still has some value in reducing overall R.” But it added: “The modelling of Scenario 7 is the least robust of the scenarios, and further exploration is needed.”One paper prepared by Sage’s modelling and behavioural subgroups on 16 April warned that, as a result of school closures, some children would have “experienced a shock to their education which will persist and affect their educational and work outcomes for the rest of their lives”.A period of home learning, the experts added, would reinforce existing inequalities between children, while months off school would mean emerging learning difficulties were missed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8f24176a62818ebc991f3ba39b506b4fbf2e646/0_138_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5c26253fc0991006d8c8c54dca17866","title":"thousands of a level students could lose their unconditional university offers","story":"Regulator seeks temporary powers after universities make 30,000 unconditional offers in lockdown panic Thousands of A-level students could have their unconditional university offers withdrawn this summer, as ministers and the higher education regulator try to crack down on panic offers made during the pandemic.Sources at Westminster say the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, is determined to constrain universities, after private government data showed that 30,000 offers that had been dependent on A-level grades were suddenly switched to “unconditional” when the pandemic struck in March.The competition to recruit UK students will be more important than ever this summer, as universities brace for the loss of thousands of international students, who generally pay higher fees. Some institutions are expecting to lose £100m in fees.Now the regulator, the Office for Students, is seeking sweeping temporary powers to control universities’ admissions, including the ability to force institutions to retract offers it disapproves of. As well as new unconditional offers, experts say this could include making universities withdraw offers accepting low grades that they made to fill places. has learned that several universities, including one in the elite Russell Group, have sought legal advice on how to challenge the OfS move, which they see as a dangerous encroachment on their autonomy.Ministers are concerned that school leavers might accept an unconditional offer from a university other than their chosen institution because they want certainty. They are also worried that if some universities change offers to gain an advantage, their competitors will be forced to follow suit, leading to a domino effect with lots of universities ignoring A-level grades.A Westminster source said: “There were some universities where every single one of their offers were converted to unconditional overnight in response to the pandemic.”Controversially, the OfS expects institutions that suddenly handed out large numbers of unconditional offers after 11 March, the date the World Health Organisation declared coronavirus a pandemic, to withdraw those offers from students who haven’t yet accepted them. If universities don’t comply, the regulator intends to levy high fines. The OfS has been advising universities that where unconditional offers are part of “usual practice”, including creative arts courses where candidates are interviewed and submit a portfolio, which is as important as predicted grades, students do not need to worry that their place might be withdrawn.The government has requested the new powers in return for its financial support package for the sector. But universities say the wording of the proposed new OfS powers, which are currently being consulted on, is so imprecise that they do not know which offers might fall foul of the rules.Dr Dean Machin, strategic policy adviser at the University of Portsmouth, says: “We’ve got enough uncertainty to be coping with right now without coming to terms with a vague new power. We don’t know what will be acceptable. It increases uncertainty at a time when that is the last thing we need.”He says Portsmouth did not switch any offers, but a minority of other institutions saw the financial risks ahead and decided to act quickly. He adds that the sector generally saw this as bad practice, because by siphoning off students at a time of crisis they could potentially sink their competitors.Smita Jamdar, head of education at the law firm Shakespeare Martineau, who has been advising universities on the new OfS powers, says institutions should be extremely cautious about withdrawing any offers, which could lead to accusations of having misled students. “Students may feel they are having something valuable taken away from them. Institutions need to think carefully about the legal rights of the students and the reputational impact of it all.”Jamdar is concerned that the OfS has not defined which sorts of offers it wants to stamp out. She says universities could, for example, be challenged for accepting students with lower grades.She is also unhappy with the OfS plan to backdate the new rules to March. “It’s an important principle of the law that you should know the consequences of your actions at the time you do them,” she says.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, agrees it is not clear exactly which behaviour the OfS intends to punish. “In clearing every year there are universities that pretty much accept anyone they think would benefit. So if you usually take students with low grades in a normal year, are you going to fall foul of the OfS for doing it this year?”He is concerned that universities are being hit with new rules at a time many are expecting A-level grades to be less trustworthy. “If you are an admissions officer trying to fill your places and make rapid decisions it is really hard,” he says.Andrew Hargreaves, founder of the research consultancy dataHE, which has been helping universities to understand their position in the absence of A-level exams, says: “I just don’t recognise this narrative that is coming from government about universities as villains, with the OfS coming along on its white charger to rescue young people. This is a sector trying to react to a changed environment, that genuinely wants its students to succeed.” Many in the sector argue that there is no real evidence that unconditional offers are hurting students.Vice-chancellors are also concerned that the government is seeking to control far more than admissions. The consultation sets out proposals to prevent universities “engaging in any form of conduct” that could have a negative impact on students or the “stability or integrity” of the higher education system. It emphasises that this “includes but is not limited to” admissions. University chiefs say any number of issues the government doesn’t like could fall into this definition.Jamdar says this is “apparent opportunism. The sector has asked for support and the government has seen it as the chance not only to ensure stability in recruitment, but also to establish a basis to intervene in a much broader and quite onerous way. I feel deeply uncomfortable about it.”Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, agrees. “This is a time of crisis, but we are still in a democracy. These powers are deliberately intended to circumvent the Higher Education Act of 2017, which enshrined universities’ autonomy in law.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are committed to supporting our world-class universities and students through this challenging time. Prospective students will understandably feel nervous about their future, and their interests must be put first. We do not want students to be pressured into a major life decision which might not be right for them.“The range of measures we announced, including student number controls, aim to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a3a2c3918c7397d4d7464e380718955505fdbbf/0_299_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90efdfaeb50c99533343fe0f0ed40e19","title":"exploitative conditions germany to reform meat industry after spate of covid 19 cases","story":"Ban on use of subcontractors and fines of €30,000 for slaughterhouses breaching new labour regulations a ‘historic moment’, say campaignersThe German government has announced a series of reforms of the meat industry, including a ban on the use of subcontractors and fines of €30,000 (£26,000) for companies breaching labour regulations, as slaughterhouses have emerged as coronavirus hotspots.A number of meat plants across the country have temporarily closed after hundreds of workers tested positive for Covid-19 in recent weeks.This week more than 90 workers were reported to have fallen ill at a plant in Dissen, Lower Saxony. Following an outbreak at a plant in Coesfeld, where more than 270 of 1,200 workers tested positive, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia announced mass testing of industry employees.An outbreak at a plant in Bavaria in the district of Straubing-Bogen coincides with numbers of infections reaching the “emergency break” level of 50 cases per 100,000 residents. States passing this point are allowed to reimpose lockdown restrictions.“The corona outbreaks have not surprised us at all,” said Jonas Bohl, from the German Food, Beverages and Catering Union. “Rather the surprise was that they took a while to emerge. The people not only work closely together but more importantly they live together, in very cramped conditions where there is no possibility to keep social distance.”As in Ireland, the UK and the US, meat plants in Germany have been accused of failing to adequately protect workers.Hubertus Heil, Germany’s minister for work and social affairs, said the high number of infections showed that better health and safety was “urgently needed” in the industry. This week the government announced a series of new measures to increase health and safety protection for workers, and reform the system of subcontracted labour.Of the roughly 90,000 staff employed by major meat plants in Germany, an estimated two-thirds are hired through subcontractors, according to Fair Mobility, a civil society organisation supporting eastern European migrant workers in Germany.From 1 January 2021 the use of subcontractors will be banned and large meat processing companies will only be able to use workers they directly employ.The German Association of the Meat Industry announced its support for additional health and safety measures, but argued that the ban on subcontracted labour was “discriminatory” and questioned how far it could be implemented. It also rejected criticisms that the coronavirus outbreaks illustrate an industry-wide problem, and outlined its own five-point improvement plan.Bohl, from the food and catering union, argues that although hygiene was tightened on many factory floors due to coronavirus, German meat plants didn’t do enough to address the transport and accommodation issues workers faced.Two Romanian former employees of a Bavarian slaughterhouse told the  they were “not at all” surprised at the outbreaks.“There were houses where you could find even 20 people,” said *Alex. “It takes one asymptomatic person in one house to spread the virus to everyone else. You could not isolate alone in a packed house.”Bohl said the subcontractors often made extra money by renting out cheap buildings – such as former army barracks or office spaces – to a large number of workers.Former slaughterhouse worker *Lucas said that during his employment with a subcontractor there were sometimes as many as five people to a room and conditions were “terrible”. “In the first house we had cockroaches and mice and in the second house the room was full of mould and we had no heat – in November – until they brought an electric heater.”According to Fair Mobility, shifts of 12–14 hours are not uncommon in the industry. Lucas said people were pressured by subcontractors to work beyond contracted hours or risk dismissal.“We were like modern slaves,” he said. “You weren’t allowed to get sick, if you got sick there was a very good chance you’d lose your job.”While German slaughterhouse employees also worked through the pandemic, migrant workers are frequently isolated from the German community and institutions around them, and often lack access to information in their own language, said Chemnitz.The workers have become even more vulnerable during the coronavirus pandemic, Bohl said. “They have a lot of fear about their health, but also about their futures and money. It’s often not clear who pays for this period when they can’t work.”While it depended on the subcontractor, Bohl feared some would not be paid if they were unable to work during the pandemic.“It is always that people are kicked out when they get sick but especially during corona,” said Guido Grüner, from ALSO in Oldenburg, a civil society organisation providing advice for many slaughterhouse workers. In recent weeks he had witnessed workers with a doctor’s note to stay off work being let go, especially if they were within their probation period.“This is an industry that is really living from weak working conditions and cheap salaries,” said Chemnitz, adding that a strong agricultural lobby and Germany’s role as a major meat producer have held the system in place.* Names have been changed• We want to hear from you about your experiences and stories from inside the farming industry.

Deadline reported that New Regency saw off competition from other major players including Netflix, MGM and British producers Working Title for “a low seven-figure deal”.Bregman told the : “I was so surprised the story exploded in the way it did. Dozens of film-makers wanted the story. I thought it was vital for us to collectively decide what to do.“We had received lots of offers, and pitches. It was really important to all of us that they understood this was a Tongan story, there were very deep cultural reasons why these boys were able to survive – their spirituality, their upbringing. Yesterday at 6am we had a Zoom call, all of us, in four different time zones. When we made the decision it was a very emotional moment for all of us.”In keeping with the collective spirit, Bregman says they will share the proceeds equally, with each receiving one-sixth. Bregman says he will donate his share to a Tongan charity.Bregman says that New Regency “made very clear promises in that regard”, adding: “It was very important to all of us that they would honour the Pacific voice, that the film would go really deep in understanding Tongan culture.” While no names of potential writers or directors are being made public, Bregman said that the survivors – Sione, Mano, Tevita and Luke – would act as consultants to the project, and that as much production as possible would take place in the region. The decision was unanimous, Bregman said, and their meeting ended with a prayer led by Sione, who is now a pastor in the Church of Tonga based in Oakland, California.Some speculation has surrounded Warner’s participation in the agreement, partly as he raised money for the teenagers after they were imprisoned on their return to Tonga (for the theft of the fishing boat), by selling story rights to Australian TV. Bregman says that he is very unhappy with suggestions that Warner sought to make money from his role in the rescue – “it is very far from the truth” – a view backed up by Mano, who told the : “If no Mr Warner, we never survive, if no Mr Warner we won’t be here to tell our story. If Mr Warner makes some money from it, good luck for him, that’s my opinion. I would tell everybody please shut up.”Bregman added: “This will have a huge cultural, social economic impact for Tonga. People have been telling each other this story for decades in Tonga, and it’s so great that after 50 years this story is getting the attention it deserves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6730a49a419008421d7d5620d2cc60cdc386e2b/0_442_4286_2572/master/4286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fc6730c6e225b47089764072c7c5eec","title":"ice cream with a twist delicious recipes with added cool","story":"Fancy more than a vanilla cone?

Many pubs and restaurants are positively encouraging customers to use their suppliers to keep them going. Others, such as The Fox \u0026amp Hounds in Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, are selling wines direct themselves, alongside pasta sauces and pies.Granted, you won’t find much – if anything – for less than £6 at an indy, but if you’re prepared to spend between £7 and £10 a bottle, you’ll certainly get a more interesting wine than you would from a supermarket. And you can get it delivered to your door, rather than having to queue for an hour to get in, social distance down the wine aisles or lurk over your computer late at night in the hope of finding a delivery slot.Fresh, easy-drinking blend of sauvignon blanc, verdejo, tempranillo blanco, viura and three other grape varieties, which makes it more nuanced than straight sauvignon blanc. And which you wouldn’t expect for this price or this region.At the equivalent of £8.66 a bottle, this isn’t bargain basement, but it is good value for a generously rich, spicy red. It comes in a stylish tube that would make it a good gift, too. Ideal with baked pasta dishes such as lasagne, or with a lockdown cheeseboard.Enticingly deep-coloured, full-flavoured Spanish rosé from Somantano from a couple who make, import and sell the wines themselves. Perfect for summer barbecues (and with Sainsbury’s Bacon Crispies, according to their Instagram feed.)Joyous, gulpable, juicy red that’s really good value – and organic, to boot. The accompanying fresh, zippy white (a blend of verdejo and sauvignon blanc), while not quite as beguiling, is very drinkable too.Not the cheapest prosecco on the market, but with a great deal more character than most at the price.

It is hoped the data will create a sense of reassurance before the second tier’s scheduled return to small group training on Monday.All senior players and staff have been swabbed by independent testers with the outcomes expected on Sunday in order to facilitate the reopening of training grounds 24 hours later.The newly published English Football League medical and safety protocols enable teams to save more than £1,000 a week by subsequently allowing players or club staff to self-administer the twice weekly mandatory procedures involving the extraction of samples from the back of the nose and throat. Around eight teams, Middlesbrough included, are understood to have opted for this system but two thirds of their counterparts will rely on testers visiting their training grounds.Apart from preparing for a resumption of the season pencilled in for 20 June, players must submit to daily temperature checks and complete medical questionnaires every 24 hours.Strict physical distancing has been imposed at every club with communal areas, including canteens, remaining closed although there is scope for players to collect takeaway food for home consumption from training ground kitchens.All personnel must use one-way walkways to navigate their workplaces, thereby avoiding unintentional close contact, spitting is strictly banned and physiotherapists are advised to wear personal protective equipment when treating injured players.The protocols – designed in conjunction with the testing company Nationwide Pathology – necessitate managers adjusting to staging tactical meetings by either video or telephone conference.With League One clubs still to decide whether they want to resume the current campaign or follow League Two’s example and conclude it now, third tier players will not be returning to training on Monday and cannot do so until they are tested.The EFL has stressed that the use of Nationwide Pathology dictates there will be no impact on NHS resources. Although the number of tests taken and positive cases revealed will be made publicly available, no inidual club data will be released with players and staff entitled to anonymity unless they wish to waive it.“There will be a flexible approach to testing, with a combination of procedures conducted by independent testers, club medical staff and some self-testing as required,” the EFL said in a statement. “The accuracy of these tests is aligned with government guidelines and will not prevent other iniduals from receiving a test.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef34a0fd58f7e9957d4d8c98a1e44487e3b721a4/0_151_4521_2713/master/4521.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=64c32c4bfe4bc374bf61691b15458195","title":"hertha berlin v union berlin bundesliga live","story":"5 min “Er,” begins Colin Flint, “they just changed ends before the game... in an empty stadium!”Is that weird?

His early posts had done well to gain 100 views. Perhaps he had overestimated the demand for long videos of a 46-year-old man putting numbers in a grid from his spare room in Surrey.A year later, Anthony is one half of an unlikely viral sensation: Cracking the Cryptic, the channel he runs with his old friend Mark Goodliffe, has become a lockdown fixture for millions. Much to the puzzlement of both men, they have turned sudoku into what right now might be the world’s most popular spectator sport.“It’s amazing when a video goes viral because it just goes everywhere,” Anthony says from his home in Reigate. The channel he launched three years ago has taken off in the past few weeks, attracting more than 200,000 rapt subscribers and almost 30m views. “It’s just very, very surreal,” he adds.Anthony’s latest hit is The Miracle Sudoku, a strangely compelling 25-minute video in which he takes on a seemingly impossible grid. In each video, a live view of the puzzle fills the left half of the screen, next to a webcam view of Anthony or Goodliffe, who commentate on their attempts to solve it.“You’ve got to be joking,” Anthony says as he considers a grid that contains only two given numbers. As well as the normal rules (each row, column and block of little squares must contain the numbers one to nine) this puzzle contains a series of constraints. Adjacent cells can’t contain consecutive digits, for example.At first Anthony thinks the compiler must be trolling him. Then slowly he begins to add numbers to the screen. When, 10 minutes in, he finds a place for all the ones and twos, Anthony dares to dream. “This is just staggering,” he says as the threes then fall into place, never departing from a soothing Home Counties monotone. “We are watching magic unfold here.”Soon it becomes clear that Anthony is going to solve the puzzle. “I’m not sure I’ve got the adjectives to describe what is going on here,” he says as numbers pour into the grid like rain on a desert. “It’s like the universe is singing to us.”Demand had already surged in lockdown. Anthony launched the channel in June 2017 but with its spare-room scenery, low-fi design and split-screen webcam format, it looks like it was made for this moment. Anthony suspects something else is happening. “We’re getting an awful lot of emails saying we’re helping people with their mental health,” he says. “There seems to be a sort of ASMR-type quality to the videos.”Before the “miracle” post, the big breakthrough came last month when Anthony put up another 25-minute video. It elicited phrases such as “good grief!” and “that’s quite startling, it really is”, but didn’t really stand out. Anthony has watched it race towards 4 million views. “It’s just bonkers,” he says, still baffled. “We focus all our time on solving puzzles but the YouTube algorithm is one that we have not cracked.”Tweets poured in from maths royalty. Simon Singh, the writer, Rachel Riley of Countdown fame and Bobby Seagull, the teacher and University Challenge star, are all fans. But fame has gone quickly mainstream – and global.“I’ve officially unlocked a new level of boredom... currently watching videos of a man solving sudoku puzzles,” James Charles, a 20-year-old millionaire American makeup artist with 19 million YouTube subscribers and 2bn views, tweeted last month. He had been binge watching the channel for days. “The videos are SO interesting but also help me relax!” he told his 5.5 million Twitter followers. “WTF IM LEGIT WATCHING HIM RN,” one replied.Anthony and Goodliffe, who is 53 and lives in Gloucestershire, have now increased output to two daily videos and receive dozens of submissions a day from sudoku constructors. They have launched three apps and a range of merchandise.Anthony, who has two young children, does not regret quitting his City job. “I only did it for one reason and was constantly aware I was working my youth away,” he says. He left with some savings and a notion that money from YouTube ads might then pay the bills. His income is still lower than it was – but it’s now climbing fast.Anthony met Goodliffe at a crossword championships 20 years ago, before the sudoku boom of 2005. Puzzling then was exclusively a pencil affair and newspapers were the only outlet. “Now there is a way to reach these vast audiences from a loft in Reigate. It’s…” For the second time this month, Anthony struggles to find the adjectives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a432781f99c7defc1f191192c2307b5e3dad7534/1094_697_5750_3450/master/5750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=078f0877581a977018225d3896c7b46f","title":"experience im stranded in a ghost town","story":"I found a VHS copy of The Shining left by a previous owner. I can’t bring myself to watch it I got a text from a friend at 2am one night in the summer of 2018. It said: “Wanna buy a ghost town?” I thought it was a weird joke, but I clicked on the link and started reading about Cerro Gordo. It was a piece of American history straight out of a wild west movie: an abandoned 19th-century silver-mining town about 200 miles from Los Angeles. At its height, it had about 4,000 residents, mostly miners who spent their time seeking their fortunes and drinking a lot. There was a history of gun fights at one point police were reporting a murder a week. There’s a rumour that Butch Cassidy hid out there for a while.When the mines closed in the 1930s, almost everyone left and the abandoned town changed hands several times. Now there was just a caretaker called Robert who has kept watch over the town for 21 years, protecting it from the occasional looting attempt, and the whole town was for sale.I grew up in Florida and consider myself a bit of an entrepreneur. I own a backpacker hostel in Austin, Texas, which was built in 1892. I’ve always liked that combination of hospitality and history. But I was 30 years old, the hostel was doing well and I was looking for a project that was more of a challenge. When I saw Cerro Gordo, I thought it would be incredible if people could stay there. So, I scraped together my life savings and convinced a few investors to get involved. On Friday 13 July 2018, we closed the deal.For the next year or so things went slowly we waited for permits and tried to make a start on the renovations. Everything takes an age, because it’s so hard to get people or materials here. When the coronavirus pandemic started, I got a call from Robert. His wife lives in Arizona and he wanted to be with her before lockdown began, so he asked if I could watch over the town to keep it safe from looters.I originally planned on staying a week or two. There are 22 buildings, including a church, hotel and general store I thought I could repair some and we could start renting them out to visitors. Mother Nature had other plans.A snowstorm hit the night I arrived. My truck didn’t even make it all the way it was stuck, spinning out in the snow 500 yards before town. I left it in the middle of the single-lane road and walked the rest of the way.It snowed almost every day for 10 days. It got to the point where I could barely open my front door. The road here is precarious. It rises 4,500ft over seven miles, so it was now completely impassable.And then, because of the pandemic, California issued a “shelter in place” order, so there were two reasons I couldn’t leave.The town has electricity, but no running water. All the food I brought with me is gone, but luckily Robert left a pretty large store of tins. I’ve eaten a lot of out-of-date beans.I have been here for more than a month now. I have a phone signal, but the internet isn’t powerful enough to stream Zoom or Netflix. To pass the time, I’ve been playing museum curator, finding time capsules from the town’s history. A week ago, I found a briefcase, and inside were cheques from the 1920s, orce settlements and love letters: the highs and lows of one miner’s life.The thought of death is never far away part of the town’s atmosphere is its grim nature. The cemetery has about 1,300 graves there are bullet holes in the walls of The American, the local hotel built in 1870, and blood stains from an infamous disagreement in its card room. I found a huge VHS collection left by the previous owners, including a copy of The Shining. I can’t bring myself to watch it.If there is a silver lining, it is that the pandemic is forcing me to spend time here working on the buildings. I have taught myself to build a deck and to track animals most are rabbits, but a bobcat visits my porch every night leaving big paw prints.Once the snow has melted, I will stay here because I would like to give Robert more time with his family, and the news doesn’t make me want to go to a big city any time soon. Some days I can’t believe a place like this was available to buy. It’s a part of history, and I want it preserved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4382f922f2be1ee2f01a54f967b337378296aa19/0_161_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8457fb660cb15f1e6939384df35b806","title":"have you been living in lockdown with a brand new partner","story":"We would like to hear from people in new relationships on how they are coping living together during lockdownThe pandemic has changed all our relationships, but we would like to hear from people in new ones (specifically those who had been with their partner for a month or less before lockdown) about how they are coping living together in times of quarantine.

A barrister gives his viewOver the last few weeks  Money has highlighted many excuses made by the travel industry, particularly airlines, when refusing refunds for Covid-19-related cancellations. One reader even wrote in about a battle for a refund from a hotel on a Scottish island to which non-residents cannot now take ferries.There will doubtless be many cases taken on the consequences of the virus but the present law is quite simple. Once a contract becomes impossible to perform, due to the fault of neither party, it is treated as frustrated, meaning neither party is bound and any advance payments, including deposits, have to be refunded.Impossibility has a broad meaning but includes the situation where performance would become illegal. This was decreed in 1917, where the building of a reservoir was halted by government wartime regulations. Perhaps not surprisingly, the builders were not liable for their failure to complete.Travel being banned under the hastily passed Coronavirus Act, means the vast majority of UK holiday accommodation bookings cannot be performed legally even if the accommodation remains physically available. The non-availability of ferries or flights will make the situation even clearer in some cases.Airlines cannot in such circumstances be made to pay compensation under EU regulation 261 or otherwise – but they cannot retain fares for flights that do not exist or insist on passengers rebooking. Some are making that the easiest option. EasyJet, although accepting its obligation to make refunds, requires passengers to phone its virtually unobtainable customer services department or use a well hidden and only recently added form on its website which will require customers to wait for the “duration of the summer”, while allowing those who want to rebook to do so very simply online.Frustration does not just depend on illegality. With events being cancelled some months into the future, including August’s Edinburgh festival, hoteliers may hope that travel to the venue will no longer be against the law then and refuse cancellations. However, cases arising out of the postponement of Edward VII’s coronation in 1902 may oblige them to refund deposits. A Mr Henry who had booked rooms to watch it was entitled to his money back, although it would have been possible for him to occupy the rooms anyway. So long as the parties know what the purpose of the stay is, the cancellation of the event makes the contract impossible to perform as envisaged, as is likely to be the case where hotels market themselves and raise prices for a specific event.Where the accommodation is abroad, like that of one reader who had been refused a refund even after a Spanish hotel closed completely, the contract may be subject to a foreign law. However, EU-wide consumer protection laws would mean a refund was due. In the US, where citing Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code may be helpful and in most English-speaking countries the same basic law of frustration applies.Some contracts contain clauses that specify what will happen in the event of force majeure. This is not defined in English law but according to the Dutch airline KLM’s conditions means “extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances that are beyond the control of the party invoking it and which could not have been avoided despite all the care and attention exercised”. UK airlines do not generally include such a condition.Would-be passengers may feel it an act of corporate cynicism to prioritise the payment of £60m to Haji-Ioannou, who has not been required to call a constantly engaged number to get his money, over the equally binding obligation to refund customers who may really need the cash."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/770e09b1d79643252d138820ec2642054fa10e3c/0_0_5535_3321/master/5535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7877791a5ad66581296434470b423a1","title":"the scientific race to understand covid 19 podcast","story":"In the five months since the world learned about Covid-19, it has killed hundreds of thousands of people.

As shadow disabilities minister I know people are feeling cut off and naturally I have a lot of important matters that I want to raise about this very matter.“Right the way through this crisis disabled people have been discriminated against. They need to be at the heart of decision-making and not just an after-thought. They need to be a consideration right from the start of policymaking. The very fact the shadow disabilities minister is being disenfranchised from parliament is yet another example of poor policymaking.”Rees-Mogg has said he is continuing to work with Commons authorities to find ways for MPs to contribute to proceedings. On voting, he told MPs on Wednesday that if people wanted to make an argument for the longer term about remote voting, they were entitled to do so, but it was “an argument for another day”.Foxcroft, 42, who was diagnosed last year, said it took her a lot longer than other people to heal and there were knock-on effects from having a low immune system. For example, a common cold can last up to four weeks.Her health could be seriously endangered if she was to contract coronavirus, and like other people with certain conditions she has been asked to shield herself until 30 June. However, MPs are expected back in just over 10 days’ time.The Conservative chair of the education select committee, Robert Halfon, who has cerebral palsy and osteoarthritis, said the request for MPs to return to Westminster and end the hybrid parliament was effectively “euthanising’ some members from the Commons.Foxcroft said online voting had been a vital tool for people in her situation and there was no reason for it to be abandoned.From 2 June, any isions will require MPs to pass through the lobbies with a two-metre distance between them. To avoid people bunching together to file past the clerks, they will be ticked off remotely by clerks using a video screen.The Commons is expected to publish a risk assessment of how parliament can return at the end of next week.Only MPs are being asked to return because their work is deemed essential. Their staff can remain working from home.A Commons spokesperson said: “The Speaker continues to be very sympathetic to those who need to stay at home because they are vulnerable, shielding or have caring responsibilities, and continues to represent the views of those MPs affected to both the leader of the house and chief whip.”Foxcroft said that throughout the pandemic there had been concerns about the way disabled people have been treated, from access to online food shopping to the significant cost of personal protective equipment they are supplying for the people who look after them.The government has said councils have dedicated Covid-19 helplines designed to offer emergency support, and the Cabinet Office Disability Unit regularly engages with a wide range of disabled persons charities and organisations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75437697ad22ed549c3bed215e207d0d9e92262a/0_187_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24f124d683b6faa105e320e0ae1591cd","title":"uk has too much at stake to confront china over hong kong","story":"Former colonial power can seek to change China’s mind but is wary of enlisting in a trade warThere is widespread frustration at the British government’s muted initial response to China’s plans to impose new security laws in Hong Kong, raising the perennial questions about what the UK can realistically do to persuade China to protect the territory’s cherished freedoms.Johnny Patterson, the chief executive of Hong Kong Watch, described the UK’s response so far to the planned crackdown as “limp, inane and could have been copied and pasted directly from their previous statements”.A subsequent UK, Canada and Australia statement issued on Friday was tougher in tone.Arguably, the chances of forcing China to rethink are dependent not on the UK government – which handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a 50-year form of semi-autonomy known as one country, two systems – but largely on the reactions of others, notably the markets, the people of Hong Kong and the US Senate.The UK, as former colonial power and joint signatory of the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration, could seek to persuade Chinese diplomats that the destruction of Hong Kong’s freedoms will destroy its economic value to China. It could also warn that the measures will provoke the kind of street protests that forced China to shelve a clampdown the last time this was attempted, in 2003. Months of new protests would only damage Beijing’s image, already tarnished by allegations of a coronavirus cover-up and negligence.The UK Foreign Office could privately lobby the US to end Hong Kong’s preferential trading status by declaring it is no longer an autonomous jurisdiction. Moves to this effect are already under way on a bipartisan basis in the US, and could become a focus of revived plans for a G7 leaders’ meeting in Washington next month. The UK foreign affairs select committee chairman, Tom Tugenhadt, applauded the tough initial US response, saying: “Beijing is killing the one country, two systems model followed by all President Xi’s predecessors. He’s turning his back on the past.”Apart from that, the UK in extremis could offer sanctuary to as many as 150,000 British national overseas passport owners in Hong Kong – something the Home Office has resisted but which has support from the liberal internationalists on the Tory benches.But the government is leery of confronting China or enlisting in Donald Trump’s trade war on the country. At both official and business level, cooperation between China and the UK remains intense. In recent weeks the chancellor, the health secretary and the deputy national security adviser have all spoken with the Chinese ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming.The golden era hailed by the former prime minister David Cameron may be over, but the UK does not favour Trump’s economic decoupling. The UK is the number one European destination for Chinese foreign investment, which in the past five years has equalled the sum in the previous 30 years. China is also the UK’s third largest market. Trade has slumped in recent months but may rebound.Indeed Liu, speaking to 1,500 CBI members in a webinar on Wednesday, portrayed the UK and China as “the flagbearers for free trade and globalisation beyond Covid-19”, contrasting that alliance with Trump’s protectionism and flouting of a rules-based order.In the view of Nicolas Veron, of the Brussels-based thinktank Bruegel, it is almost as if the UK, weakened after Brexit, could become a site of competition or testing ground between China and the US as they each seek the UK’s allegiance.The ambassador seemed confident that the UK government was not about to turn against his country. “We heard some politicians spreading this argument for ‘decoupling’, and some even go so far as to preaching the cold war rhetoric against China, and that is very harmful. I had webinars with the Chinese business community because they are very concerned. They do not know how pervasive, how massive and how influential this rhetoric is. I had good conversations with British secretaries and senior officials, and they told me these words did not represent the UK government position, and I believe that.”He was speaking before the Chinese Communist party made its move on Hong Kong, but it was a reminder of how the UK today has more at stake than the civil rights of its former colony. It looks like the first true test of Boris Johnson’s Global Britain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ded3ba24c3553415810b5a3b3c96caac9055f0db/0_164_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35bbae0aec9d3c6edefee60b94193e52","title":"children covid 19 adults data coronavirus","story":"Children are about half as likely as adults to become infected with coronavirus, according to scientists who reviewed data gathered by contact tracing and population screening studies around the world.“It’s preliminary evidence, but the weight of evidence is clear that children appear to be less susceptible to Sars-Cov-2,” said Russell Viner, a professor of adolescent health at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and a senior author on the review.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..“The balance of evidence is clearly that children are the safest group to be out in the community. They have the lowest prevalence of infections and the risk of death or severe infection from Covid-19 is exceptionally low in children,” he said.“So for children themselves, the balance of risk is strongly in favour of a return to school given the very clear evidence of harm due to lockdown.”Researchers assessed more than 6,000 recent papers on the pandemic, most of which – like the review itself - have not yet been peer reviewed or formally published in journals, and whittled them down to 18 that contained useful data on children’s susceptibility to the virus.Nine of the papers examined in further detail were contact tracing studies that followed infections from person to person. Eight reported virus and antibody test data and one was a review of studies on household clusters of infections.One of the studies found that in 31 household clusters of Covid-19, only three could be traced back to a child as the person who brought the infection into the home.Another report from Australia undertook contact tracing of all Covid-19 cases in schools in New South Wales over a six-week period from early March. It found that 18 index cases, comprising nine students and nine staff, gave rise to only two further cases among students and none among teachers, though children were being pulled from the schools at the time and awareness of the infection was high.While the UCL-led review suggests that children are more resilient to the infection, the pooled data were not sufficient to confirm whether children spread the infection more or less easily than adults.“In times of uncertainty, what we need to do is mitigate risks,” Viner said. “I would concur very strongly that an effective test and trace mechanism in place is very important to mitigate the uncertainty about transmission from children.”Rosalind Eggo, a co-author on the review and an infectious disease modeller in public health epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the evidence suggested children and young people were at lower risk of infection than adults and “may therefore play a smaller role in the epidemic as a whole”.She added: “This new evidence will help us better understand the possible effect of school reopening on transmission in schools and in the community.”In a draft consultation published on Friday, a group of senior scientists warned that 1 June was too soon for schools to reopen safely and that more time was needed to set up an effective track and trace system to contain future outbreaks.The Independent Sage committee, chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir David King, found the risk of children picking up the virus could be halved if they returned to school two weeks later than ministers were proposing. Delaying until September would reduce the risk still further, the report adds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0748119492880663b2787ec8c35aa95af20337/0_0_4056_2433/master/4056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ccc933f3d8faabd789a99f0071c9688","title":"young people tell us how rising unemployment rates are affecting you","story":"As unemployment rates skyrocket in the UK, we’d like to hear from those under 25 who have lost jobs, or are struggling to get work, due to coronavirusYoung people, who often have less experience in employment and applications, are likely to be one of the most affected groups.We’d like to hear from those under 25 who have been made unemployed, or are struggling to get a job, due to coronavirus.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

We need New Deal-type policies now to help themYouth unemployment and its scarring effects on the careers of young people were a major concern in the 2008-09 recession. Now that hopes for a “V-shaped recovery” from the Covid-19 pandemic are vanishing, the issue of scarring is again relevant.Past research has shown that those who enter the labour market during a downturn carry the costs of doing so into middle age. These come in the form of lower wages and higher risk of unemployment. Whereas the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, may claim it is “too early to set anything like that at all” (BBC Today Programme 19 May), the evidence is clear: recessions do lasting damage to young people.Millennials have had a bad time since the 2008 crash. Unattainable housing, job precarity, tuition fees and Brexit all played against their interests. Yet, the grievances of the young have largely been ignored by the political class. The privileges of the old, such as the triple lock on pensions, have never come under serious threat. Unlike previous generations, the young have been unwilling to take to the streets to galvanise political change.Yet, they have enthusiastically embraced inidual causes. Top of their list has been climate change. Pressure from young voters (and from those not yet able to vote) contributed to the UK, Welsh and Scottish governments each declaring a climate emergency in 2019. The young are concerned about the future of the planet: they will have to deal with the consequences of global warming.Roosevelt’s favourite New Deal policy was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). It hired young, unmarried men to work on conservation and development of natural resources in rural areas. During its nine years of operation, 3 million young men, mainly aged 18 to 25, passed through the CCC. Most of the jobs were manual. It was credited with improving the employability, wellbeing and fitness of participants.Introducing a UK version of the CCC focused on mitigating climate change risks and aimed at those aged 16 to 24 could avoid the creation of yet another “lost generation”, scarred by long spells of unemployment. It would build on the enthusiasm of the young to save the planet. There is no shortage of issues to address – flood risks, tree planting, domestic heating conversion, renewable energy, restoring bioersity etc. Funding would come partly from expanded allocations to the relevant departments in the forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review. Organisation could build on the successes of publicprivate sector and community initiatives during the pandemic. No brainer?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ec26a14776a2ff7b4448da8bf1dbbe7cba9dd63/0_491_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7703810d1529f531b28e408a4c8cc3c9","title":"cricket chris woakes says england players would welcome back alex hales","story":"Alex Hales would have the backing of the England dressing room in the event of a surprise recall this summer, according to Chris Woakes.Woakes was among those consulted by the limited-overs captain, Eoin Morgan, before Hales was dropped on the eve of last year’s World Cup win after it emerged the opener had served a 21-day ban for a second recreational drug offence.But while Morgan stated that trust still needs to be rebuilt and “11 months is actually not that long ago”, the sudden need for a pool of up to 45 players to cover England’s rescheduled Test and limited-overs summer could prompt a rethink.At the age of 31, it is possibly a case of now or never for Hales, at least while Morgan remains captain. Should the respected leader’s view mellow in light of the extraordinary circumstances then Woakes expects the rest of the setup to fall in line.Woakes said: “I’m a believer that people serve their time, so to speak. He’s gone through a tough time being left out of the World Cup going on to see that team lift the trophy must have been difficult for him. I think if people have gone away for a time and worked on their weaknesses they should be allowed a second chance. Alex is as a world-class player. In a way I felt sorry for him but I understand the decision from the management, captain and rest of the team.The white-ball team’s goal of a second global title will probably be delayed by the expected postponement of the T20 World Cup in Australia this October (the slot for which looks set to be taken by a rescheduled Indian Premier League). It means the Test team will take priority selection-wise this summer – if that was not already the case – and not least since movement between formats is likely to be restricted by the bio-secure measures in place.A temporary ban on using saliva to shine the ball is expected to be confirmed by the International Cricket Council and so the 31-year-old expects players will need to work harder to get swing during the proposed six Tests against West Indies and Pakistan.Woakes, who has been forced to train wearing an alice band due to 12 weeks without a haircut, said: “From a bowler’s point of view we’ve just got to find a way to shine it for harder and longer to find a way of getting some shine on the ball. Thankfully it’s a Dukes ball and not a Kookaburra this summer, because then we would be struggling. I’m sure we will find a way of getting some shine and making sure it does move off the straight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d20c2c0544660c337abe163d6bf33f1980efd36/0_36_5536_3324/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70cf956de09dd9304b912fe6a5a1cb62","title":"your best holiday food or drink memory","story":"Whether it was cheap-as-chips or budget-busting, tell us ab out the most mind-blowing food-and-drink experience you’ve had on your travelsPerfect pizza in a Naples backstreet or spicy-sharp noodles from a Hanoi stall?

Last night he was celebrating the end of his junior year exams by eating chicken wings, playing Fortnite and FaceTiming his friends.But last month, Jackson unwittingly went viral  after he released a TikTok video raising the alarm on the huge number of Covid-19 cases hitting the Navajo Nation, a territory occupying parts of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico.He compares the situation in the Navajo Nation – now first in the US in terms of cases per 100,000, with 4,253 cases and 146 known deaths, to West Virginia. West Virginia s 24,038 square miles – making it smaller than the Navajo Nation, at 27,413 square miles. Despite this, Jackson explains: “West Virginia is living on 163 grocery stores, we’re living on 13. They are living on 63 hospitals, we are living on six.”“Today we live on broken treaties and broken promises from the US government … This is America,” he finishes.At the time, the Navajo Nation had the third-highest number of Covid-19 cases in the US, and yet Jackson could find scant news on the issue. On Monday this week, the Navajo Nation surpassed New York state for the highest Covid-19 infection rate.“I was like – everyone knows everything about New York. There are so many different news outlets reporting on this one state. Why is there no news coverage for us, or any Native Americans?” he says. “I just thought that wasn’t fair.“I just wanted to spread awareness, to give people basic, raw information because I thought the news was sugarcoating it. I wanted to show what it’s like here, the number of Covid-19 cases and the basic resources the Navajo Nation just doesn’t have,” he says.“That makes me pretty sad,” says Jackson. “It’s really disappointing, it gets under your skin, it makes you angry. It’s really sad to think that people would push a whole group of people under the rug and just pretend that they are not there,” he says.’s own reporting revealed the Navajo Nation received its relief package six weeks after it was promised – only receiving it after suing the federal government. Meanwhile, Indian Country reports that the $8bn relief package set aside for almost 600 Native American Tribes is “woefully inadequate”.Jackson has an entire YouTube channel, in the name of Jojo Jackson, dedicated to Native American culture: lip-syncing over Navajo artist Radmilla Cody’s songs sharing his favorite sayings and showcasing the fairs on the Navajo Nation that he loves. He enjoys making those videos most – but that doesn’t seem to be what the rest of the world is interested in.Does he think that Trump is doing enough to help? “I don’t think there will ever be a time where the government has done enough for Native Americans, considering what they have done to us in the past and where we are now,” says Jackson.He points out that even aside from the Covid-19 crisis going on reservations right now: Native American women are killed and trafficked at much higher rates than the US average – with a murder rate 10 times higher than the average on some reservations meanwhile, Native people are currently having their sacred burial grounds blown up to build a border wall.I ask him what message he wants to leave people with. “I just want us to be seen. Not as ‘other’, but just as people,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

Investors had thus far rejected the terms proposed by president Alberto Fernández’s centre-left government, which came to power late last year.This month, a group of leading economists including Thomas Piketty and the Nobel prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz urged bondholders to take a constructive approach to restructuring Argentina’s debts. They argued debt relief for the country would be “the only way to combat the pandemic and set the economy on a sustainable path”.A group of international investors – including Ashmore, BlackRock and AllianceBernstein – that hold about $16.7bn of Argentinian bonds said on Friday that they recognised the country was seeking a comprehensive deal, even though failure to pay would trigger a default, Reuters reported.Sarah-Jayne Clifton, director of Jubilee Debt Campaign, said that Argentina was right to demand a deep debt restructuring and to default if lenders did not accept a deal. “Reckless lending at high interest rates helped to create the current crisis, so lenders and speculators should share in the costs,” she said.City economists said missing bond payments on Friday would result in the country’s ninth sovereign debt default. But talks to restructure the debt would still proceed.The country has been in recession for two years after a currency crisis that led it to agree a three-year loan from the International Monetary Fund for $57.1bn, the biggest loan in the Washington-based fund’s history.Public borrowing is, however, expected to rise sharply this year as the coronavirus pandemic triggers the deepest global recession since the 1930s Great Depression.Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said Argentina was being bullied by “irresponsible financiers intent on rejecting a very reasonable debt restructure” that would allow the country to meet its obligations to its people during the pandemic.“Governments must not put the demands of creditors ahead of public need, especially during a public health emergency,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44c7218c271e28ed49fb55296b9fa810d669aff1/0_234_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8618439ceeea0b30c79e41f80f5073d","title":"cher sheds tears of joy as pakistans loneliest elephant wins freedom","story":"Kaavan, a 33-year-old elephant living a sorry existence in Islamabad zoo, to be released after campaign by pop iconThe plight of an animal known as Pakistan’s loneliest elephant is set to come to an end after a court declared he should be freed from Islamabad zoo – to the delight of his longtime champion, pop icon Cher.Kaavan, a 33-year-old Asian elephant from Sri Lanka, has been the focus of a four-year campaign by Cher to secure his release from Murghazar Zoo in Pakistan’s capital, after the singer saw pictures of the elephant living alone and held miserably in chains in a small enclosure, with only a small dirty pond to play in.On Thursday, Islamabad high court ruled that Kaavan should be freed, and ordered wildlife officials to consult with Sri Lanka to find him a “suitable sanctuary” within 30 days.The news was met with triumph by Cher, who declared it to be one of the greatest moments of her life. Writing on twitter, Cher said tears were rolling down her face at the decision. She thanked the Pakistani government and then simply tweeted “Pakistani”.The life of Kaavan has become one of turmoil. He arrived in Pakistan as a one-year-old, a gift to former dictator General Zia-ul-Haq from the Sri Lankan government, but began to be held in chains in 2002 when zookeepers were concerned about his increasingly violent tendencies.He began to show further distress after his mate Saheli, who arrived from Bangladesh in 1990, died in 2012. No other company was brought in for him, despite elephants being sociable animals who need companions, and he began to be known as Pakistan’s loneliest elephant, cutting a sorry figure in the zoo.Kaavan’s woes continued until recently. Last year his keepers were suspended for stealing his food and a few months ago it was discovered that wild boars had been breaking into his enclosure and stealing his bread and fruit. Kaavan was also found to be severely dehydrated.In 2016 his case was taken up by Cher, who sent a representative to the zoo to try to get him released from captivity, and a petition for his freedom had hundreds of thousand of signatures.The singer said she could barely believe Kaavan’s freedom was now secured. “It’s so emotional for us that I have to sit down,” tweeted Cher."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89698f8e93a15cb84f395ebc5117c3969fb06494/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a12d69648f3f63fa5bd5448aad3d5bd6","title":"chinese security forces could be deployed in hong kong under new law","story":"Hong Kong officials indicate powers will be used to try to suppress pro-democracy protestsChina’s proposed new security law for Hong Kong will allow Beijing’s security forces to operate in the city, where local authorities have indicated the powers will be used to try to suppress the pro-democracy protests that broke out almost a year ago.The law bars subversion, separatism, “acts of foreign interference” and terrorism, all charges that have been used in mainland China to mute political opponents. The draft comes before China’s rubber-stamp parliament next week and is certain to be passed without change or real opposition.A draft version circulating on Friday would allow the “national security organs of the central people’s government” to set up outposts in Hong Kong, which has its own police force. These security bodies would “safeguard national security,” the document states.Last week Hong Kong authorities detained 15 of the city’s most prominent pro-democracy figures for illegal assembly the new legislation could make such activists and campaigners still more vulnerable.The spectre of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 has hung over the last year of unrest in Hong Kong. Particularly as violence escalated, there were mounting concerns among demonstrators that police or military personnel might be sent over from the mainland to clear the streets – fears that are now likely to deepen, analysts said.“So they are expecting the protests to come, and they are prepared to go and crush them. And I regrettably think they will crush them.”Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, explicitly linked provisions of the new law to the “disturbances” of the protest movement.She said in a statement that offences covered in the legislation were “exactly the situations which the political and business sectors in Hong Kong and members of the public have been worrying about over the past year”.“The emergence of various incidents involving explosives and firearms has posed the risk of terrorism, seriously jeopardising public safety,” the statement said, adding a frequently stated and unsubstantiated charge that the protesters were manipulated by foreigners.For years Beijing had been chipping away at the autonomy that Hong Kong was guaranteed for 50 years when the British colonial administration handed the city back to Chinese rule in 1997. But it has also had setbacks, with mass protests forcing authorities to drop a national security law in 2003 and more recently the extradition law that sparked last year’s demonstrations.News of the law stunned Hong Kong’s pro-democracy activists and lawmakers, and there was an outpouring of fear, grief and anger in the city. On Friday afternoon legislators protested against the decision in the legislature and were forcibly removed. Street demonstrations will follow, with the first mass gathering expected on Sunday.Downloads of VPN software that allows users to circumvent Chinese censorship and browse anonymously rose overnight after the law was announced.There is no hope that the legislation can be altered or delayed by people turning out on the streets in Hong Kong, but over the past year many protesters said they had come out on to the streets out of desperation rather than in real hope of change.Even if authorities have more tools to stop demonstrations, and an even clearer message of intent to break the movement, intimidation alone is unlikely to keep Hong Kong’s people off the streets. Some will be hoping to garner international support, which they see as the only slim hope of pushing back against Beijing.Pompeo’s statement attacking China’s “disastrous” move was part of a strong chorus of international condemnation. In a joint statement with the Australian and Canadian foreign ministers, the UK’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he was “deeply concerned” about the proposed new law, and he emphasised that the “legally binding” 1984 agreement – which promised Hong Kong 50 years of autonomy – remained in force.“Making such a law on Hong Kong’s behalf without the direct participation of its people, legislature or judiciary would clearly undermine the principle of ‘one country, two systems’, under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy,” the statement said.A bipartisan bill being introduced by the US senators Chris Van Hollen and Pat Toomey would impose sanctions on officials and entities that enforce any new national security laws, the Washington Post reported.China’s foreign ministry said it would fight back against any US attempt to influence the law.It is unclear how many western countries will have the appetite to enforce costly sanctions or other penalties at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is causing massive economic strain.Lam insisted that Hong Kong was and “will remain a very free society”. She brushed off concerns about the economic impact of China’s move.Hong Kong has functioned as a regional hub for many international companies who want to do business in China but also seek the protection of an independent judicial system. It has also provided Chinese firms with access to international investment and the global financial system.With the legal firewalls that insulated the city effectively torn down, its economic future is in question. The stock market plunged on Friday and there were already reports of people seeking to sell their assets or move them overseas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 22 may","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:About 80 million infants may have missed out on vaccines for diseases including diphtheria, measles and polio as a result of the disruption to healthcare services caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization says.According to data collected by the organisation and its partners, the provision of routine immunisations for children younger than one year old has been hindered in at least 68 countries, causing disruption to vaccine programmes not seen since their inception in the 1970s.Fighting has forced 660,000 people to flee their homes since the UN secretary general called for a global ceasefire to focus on handling the pandemic, an NGO says.António Guterres reiterated his call for an end to conflict this week. But the Norwegian Refugee Council says that the UN security council has failed to provide leadership for ceasefires, peace talks or protection of civilians during the pandemic.Two-week quarantines will be imposed on new arrivals to the UK from 8 June, with a £1,000 fine awaiting anyone who breaches the measure. The home secretary, Priti Patel, announces that mandatory self-isolation would not apply to people coming from Ireland, medics tackling Covid-19 and seasonal agricultural workers.The UK government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, says the country’s R number, which measures the number of people to whom each infected person passes the virus, is between 0.7 and 1 and that the epidemic is “either flat or declining in the UK and in most areas it is declining”.According to figures collated by the Africa Centres for Disease Control, the 54 countries in Africa have collectively identified more than 100,000 cases of infection. According to the interactive dashboard hosted on the African Union health agency’s website, there have so far been 3,101 deaths across the continent.Unlike other regions, particularly Europe, the coronavirus has been slow to spread across Africa. After the first confirmed case was reported in mid-February in Egypt, many countries responded with strict lockdowns.German tax revenues for April fall by a quarter compared to the same month last year.According to the finance ministry’s monthly report, the central government and the 16 federal states pulled in about €39bn (£34.87bn). The revenue decline is most severe for income, corporate and air traffic taxes, the report shows.The Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area will be able to move into the next phase of lockdown de-escalation from Monday, the Spanish government says. The two regions have been the areas hardest hit by Covid-19, which has killed at least 27,940 people in the country, while at least 233,037 have become infected.One of Europe’s biggest music events, Exit festival in Serbia, is rescheduled for August. Originally meant to take place in mid-July in the northern city of Novi Sad, the fate of the festival was uncertain.

We are clearly aware of that. We are aware of the requirements of the economy and business. We are aware of the concerns and anxieties of the population. But the science should inform the measures as we go forward,” she said. PHE is contributing to discussions in Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) on the infectivity of the virus in different settings and its transmission on surfaces.Greg Clark, the chair of the committee, pointed out that the UK was going it alone by insisting on a 2 metre separation. “Other countries are recommending a shorter distance,” he said. The WHO, Hong Kong, Singapore, France and China all say 1m apart is enough. Australia, Germany and the Netherlands recommend 1.5m while South Korea opts for the equivalent of 1.4m.“In international comparisons, we are an outlier at an extreme end of the distancing that is recommended,” he told her.“We are aware of the international differences,” said Doyle. There is already evidence that people are less likely to get infected out of doors, which had fed into the decision to tell the public that they could take more outdoor exercise, she said.Catherine Noakes, professor of environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds, told the committee that the virus dispersed quickly in the open air. “The chances of you being able to inhale enough in an outdoor environment is very, very small,” she said.There is very little evidence of outdoor transmission, she said. One study in China showed transmission between two people outside, but they were having a prolonged conversation, which suggested they were not far apart.People can sit closer if they are back to back or side by side, she said. “We believe at 1m to the side or back you really breathe the air in the room rather than the plume coming out of someone’s mouth,” she told the committee. Passing close by somebody in the street, she added, “the risks are very, very small”.Professor Andrew Curran, chief scientific adviser at the Health and Safety Executive, said the public needed to be involved in decisions about how they stay safe when they go back to work. Nobody should underestimate the ability of the British public to work things out for themselves, if they are given open and transparent information.“If you have to resort to PPE, you have essentially given up,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4472072dc5f3fa9785fe1033a16be43b24158e3/0_174_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d22d7090549038d3df8f51eb72b2631","title":"global report india and indonesia announce record daily infection figures","story":"China sets no growth target for first time in decades Madrid and Barcelona lockdowns to easeIndia has reported more than 6,000 new Covid-19 cases, its biggest one-day increase, while China has abandoned setting a GDP growth target because of the “great uncertainty” caused by the pandemic.The sharp increase in new infections in India came after the government began easing lockdown restrictions and as airlines prepared to reopen selected domestic routes.“This surge has happened after movement of people was partially allowed,” said Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist at India’s public health foundation. “But if you see overall, this is a much lower trajectory as compared to the rest of the world.”Infections have surged in Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous nation, ahead of celebrations this weekend to mark the end of Ramadan, raising questions about the government’s commitment to curbing the pandemic.The country reported 973 new cases, its highest one-day count, bringing its official total to more than 21,000 – although the real figure is thought to be much higher. Officials have said the public are not taking proper precautions, but only four of 34 provinces and 26 cities have imposed wide-scale restrictions.The rates of new infections have begun to dip in much of the world, but the disease is continuing its deadly march in Latin America, which was described by the World Health Organization on Friday as “a new epicentre” of the pandemic.Russia reported 150 new deaths, a record daily number that took the country’s official death toll from Covid-19 to 3,249. Authorities reported 8,894 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 326,448.China’s 3,000-member National People’s Congress opened in Beijing on Friday with a minute’s silence for coronavirus victims. The gathering was delayed by two months and has been shortened to a week because of the pandemic.In an apparent acknowledgement of the steep challenges China faces from a stricken economy and increasing international hostility, the premier, Li Keqiang, said “no specific target” would be set for growth this year, for the first time since the country began publishing GDP goals in 1990.“This is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment,” Li said, adding that the government would instead “give priority to stabilising employment and ensuring living standards”.Singapore said its case total now exceeded 30,000, with 612 new infections, almost entirely in cramped dormitories for the city state’s low-paid migrant workers.Thailand said it would maintain its state of emergency until the end of June. Shopping centres and department stores in the kingdom opened at the weekend for the first time in almost two months as the rate of infection slowed, but bars, nightclubs, cinemas, playgrounds and some sports remain off-limits.The UN said the virus was assumed to be spreading throughout Yemen. Appealing for urgent funding, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, said Yemen’s healthcare system “has in effect collapsed”.He said aid workers were turning people away because of a lack of medical oxygen or sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment in the war-ravaged country. Yemen’s malnourished population has among the world’s lowest immunity levels.In the US, pictures emerged of Donald Trump wearing a face mask during a factory visit in Michigan. The president had earlier been called a “petulant child” by a state attorney general for allegedly refusing to wear a mask during a tour of the plant.The Czech Republic said the virus remained under control nearly two weeks after shopping centres, cinemas and restaurant terraces were reopened. “The massive easing of 11 May did not affect the epidemiological curve,” said the health minister, Adam Vojtech.In Spain, the government said the Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area – the two areas hardest hit by Covid-19 – would be able to move into the next phase of lockdown de-escalation from Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c498d650796cf93315bbbd155f1ec3d4e89d86/0_417_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f96b5b9240b6248b517886e38abffa23","title":"has the coronavirus pandemic made us all nicer community","story":"This week the Upside reflects on the revival of community, from mask weavers to valiant volunteersWhat doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.

As a disengaged student he captured my imagination with his passion for American lit texts and Shakespeare. He really brought them to life for me and completely challenged my (very limited at the time) world view that men could be sensitive, popular and educated at the same time. Sadly, I didn’t grow up in the most erse environment at the time! He was a breath of fresh air, never afraid to give an opinion or to challenge my personal mediocrity. He inspired me to go to university and be successful and engaging like him when all I wanted to do was coast through life as a 16 year old.  I’m an English teacher now and I’d like to think I rock a little bit of the party boy attitude and pedagogical style with my students as often as I can. I even find myself saying: “will ya bloody shoot oop!” From time to time in his Wigan accent. Thank you, Anthony. Legend!Laura Parker relives the heady days of Leeds in the 1980s:Learning Spanish at Roundhay high with Mrs Dronfield changed my life. I went on to do Latin American Studies at university where I learnt Portuguese, spent a year in Brazil and was bitten by the travel bug. In the intervening three decades, I’ve had the good fortune to live and work in many places – including for over 10 years in Bulgaria. There I met my Italian husband with whom I’m now locked down in northern Italy.I can still muddle through a conversation in Spanish – which this weekend I will with my Spanish brother-in-law – and think of Mrs Dronfield every time I do. Thanks to her rigour, learning Italian was less painful than it might have been.I would just like her to know that in the hills of Piedmont here’s an English woman speaking Italian and thinking of her brilliant Spanish teacher.Olga Wilkinson inspired me. There were times when she discarded the syllabus entirely and challenged us directly with moral problems from history. For instance, when I declared myself a pacifist, she asked me whether, if I found myself standing next to Adolf Hitler and happened to have a gun on me, I would kill him and thus save millions of lives. (I was flummoxed, but went on to study philosophy at university.)Gillian Fitzgerald fondly remembers an early champion of equality in Liverpool:We made xylophones in Mr Bleasdale’s class. It was the age of sewing for girls, woodwork for boys, but not with Mr Bleasdale. I sawed, sanded and varnished pieces of wood, ready for Mr Bleasdale to tune each one. He drilled holes in each end, ready for twine to be threaded through. At last, our xylophones were ready. I’ll never forget the thrill of playing a musical instrument I had made.Luke Bosman remembers language classes with Mike Clark:I was a shy lad who would naturally have preferred to sit unnoticed, to put my efforts into bookwork and to quietly succeed. Yet somehow he took this boy with a speech impediment (one of the reasons why I hated to speak) and helped me to grow in confidence, such that by the time I had finished my A-levels, for which he had also been one of my Russian teachers, I could speak confidently.When I qualified as a teacher, I had an interview at a school where, unbeknown to me, he was the head of department. One of the interview questions was, “What motivated you to become a teacher?” I was obliged to answer that my inspiration was sitting to the headteacher’s left. I didn’t get the job.Jerry Goddard goes back 50 years to a history class in Bedfordshire in the 1960s:Patrick ‘Harry’ Eavis treated every pupil as if you were three-five years older than you were.

But why not turn your A4 page sideways and do it in an eight caption comic book style?’ It made you précis in a really creative way.

Now 68, the Irish musician and activist says that he has lived his life refusing to look back. “I have the point of view that there’s no rear view mirror in this car,” he says.So it might seem surprising that he not only agreed to the BBC making a documentary, Citizens of Boomtown, about his first band, The Boomtown Rats, but has also spent the last year actively engaged in reliving his past through it.Over the years our opinions of Geldof have shifted constantly. From mouthy young punk star with opinions to spare to Saint Bob, the impassioned campaigner behind Live Aid, one of the biggest global fundraising initiatives of all time to a tragic figure who lost his first wife, the TV presenter Paula Yates, and their second daughter, Peaches, to drug overdoses.The new documentary is an attempt not simply to remind us of those early days, but also to reposition the Rats as the ultimate in influential outsider bands, a group that came out of the grey repression of Holy Catholic Ireland in the 1970s with the belief that it could – and should – change the world.“We needed to change our lives and the only way to do that was to get the fuck out Ireland,” Geldof says, adding that it always infuriated him that the group were seen as “some kind of Johnny-come-latelies … when really we were Johnny-come-earlies”.“There was an assumption that we’d jumped on a bandwagon because there was no understanding that our songs were written against the background of the Ireland we came from, a culture that was enshrined in aspic where the authorities were desperately trying to hold on to power and there was no hope.”A new album, also called Citizens of Boomtown, the band’s first in 36 years, has been released, and had it not been for the coronavirus pandemicthe next few months would have been spent promoting it. “Although obviously that’s all up in the air now. We’ve rescheduled for October but I don’t know if it will happen.”The documentary, which is packed with tributes from famous fans from Bono to Sinead O’Connor, also includes scenes of Geldof and Yates, young, charismatic and obviously in love, which almost burn through the screen. They must surely have been hard to rewatch?“No, not at all,” he says. “I liked it because it was accurate as opposed to the tabloid view of us having had this sort of rancour-filled thing. We loved each other. We were together for 20 years. It was proper stuff, you know? So it was lovely to see her again and to remind people that she was very funny, very smart, very beautiful.” There’s a pause and then he adds softly: “She was just great.”The death of his daughter Peaches at the age of 25 in 2014 is harder to think about. “It’s impossible really,” he says. “When the deaths tumble on top of each other, my dad, my sister, that was tough anyway but when it’s one of your children that dies … the standard thing is that it’s as though nature has gone into reverse but, more than that, you know this is a part of you in a literal sense.”There’s a long pause. “I mean you don’t need me to emote on this, but if something that tough happens to you it’s impossible … it’s impossible to define the fug of grief you descend into or to try and articulate that grief. In Peaches’ case she … she made a noise and she made herself felt.” His voice breaks slightly. “She was far too funny, too wild really and maybe, maybe a little bit too clever for her own good.”It’s a description that could equally apply to her father, a man who was raised “without authority”, his mother dead and his father absent through work.“When that happens you learn independence and organisation very quickly, but the downside is there’s this dogmatism. There’s no one to temper your rapidly forming beliefs and no one to show you the boundaries of what’s permissible. You have to parent yourself and learn all these things. You have to invent your own universe.”He has no regrets about the way in which his subsequent fury drove him as a young man, even if becoming “Band Aid Bob” bought its own problems.“It was overwhelming. When a phenomenon occurs that enters the bloodstream of society then you do have a certain otherness. Everything changes. The only way to deal was to leverage it up by knocking on doors. So that’s what I did, eventually getting to Live 8 and the G8 summit in 2005.”That said he doesn’t think an event like Live Aid could work today. “It worked because of the position rock and roll had in society. It was a central part of the culture, but that’s not the case today. While there’s some great music and talent out there, music functions more as it did in the 1920s, 30s, 40s and 50s as a background to the way you’re living your life … people can make their own Live Aids in their bedrooms every day and put them online.”Yet for all the new technology, he’s unimpressed by the various online concerts intended to raise money and spirits during the pandemic. “They’re really hopeless. I don’t think they work at all. Plus I wish people would stop doing acoustic cover versions of rock and roll songs. Play them the way they were meant to be heard.”His own lockdown has been quiet. “I have the most mowed lawn and most washed car in the area … I have sort of loved the enforced indolence.” He does worry about whether normality will return though. “We’ve been very strict about social distancing and wearing masks, but yeah I don’t personally think people will feel safe about people trapped in a closed space with other people for a long while.”In the meantime he has one lockdown achievement he is proud of. “If I’m honest my biggest contribution in the last few months has been to grow a Kenny Rogers beard.”Citizens of Boomtown is on BBC Two at 9.20pm on Saturday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/598064486d95071c50c57891eb1b3890a8e55f25/0_193_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=594f38f45a6a48278e2459211974590a","title":"why we might not get a coronavirus vaccine","story":"Politicians have become more cautious about immunisation prospects. They are right to beIt would be hard to overstate the importance of developing a vaccine to Sars-CoV-2 – it’s seen as the fast track to a return to normal life. That’s why the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the UK was “throwing everything at it”.But while trials have been launched and manufacturing deals already signed – Oxford University is now recruiting 10,000 volunteers for the next phase of its research – ministers and their advisers have become noticeably more cautious in recent days.Earlier this week, England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said the words nobody wanted to hear: “We can’t be sure we will get a vaccine.”But he was right to be circumspect.Vaccines are simple in principle but complex in practice. The ideal vaccine protects against infection, prevents its spread, and does so safely. But none of this is easily achieved, as vaccine timelines show.More than 30 years after scientists isolated HIV, the virus that causes Aids, we have no vaccine. The dengue fever virus was identified in 1943, but the first vaccine was approved only last year, and even then amid concerns it made the infection worse in some people. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years.Scientists have worked on coronavirus vaccines before, so are not starting from scratch. Two coronaviruses have caused lethal outbreaks before, namely Sars and Mers, and vaccine research went ahead for both. But none have been licensed, partly because Sars fizzled out and Mers is regional to the Middle East. The lessons learned will help scientists create a vaccine for Sars-CoV-2, but there is still an awful lot to learn about the virus.A chief concern is that coronaviruses do not tend to trigger long-lasting immunity. About a quarter of common colds are caused by human coronaviruses, but the immune response fades so rapidly that people can become reinfected the next year.Researchers at Oxford University recently analysed blood from recovered Covid-19 patients and found that levels of IgG antibodies – those responsible for longer-lasting immunity – rose steeply in the first month of infection but then began to fall again.Last week, scientists at Rockefeller University in New York found that most people who recovered from Covid-19 without going into hospital did not make many killer antibodies against the virus.“That’s what is particularly challenging,” says Stanley Perlman, a veteran coronavirus researcher at the University of Iowa. “If the natural infection doesn’t give you that much immunity except when it’s a severe infection, what will a vaccine do? It could be better, but we don’t know.” If a vaccine only protects for a year, the virus will be with us for some time.The genetic stability of the virus matters too. Some viruses, such as influenza, mutate so rapidly that vaccine developers have to release new formulations each year. The rapid evolution of HIV is a major reason we have no vaccine for the disease.So far, the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus seems fairly stable, but it is acquiring mutations, as all viruses do. Some genetic changes have been spotted in the virus’s protein “spikes” which are the basis of most vaccines. If the spike protein mutates too much, the antibodies produced by a vaccine will effectively be out of date and might not bind the virus effectively enough to prevent infection.Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who helped identify some of the virus’s mutations, called them “an early warning”.In the rush to develop a vaccine – there are now more than 100 in development – safety must remain a priority. Unlike experimental drugs for the severely ill, the vaccine will be given to potentially billions of generally healthy people.This means scientists will have to check extremely carefully for signs of dangerous side-effects. During the search for a Sars vaccine in 2004, scientists found that one candidate caused hepatitis in ferrets. Another serious concern is “antibody-induced enhancement” where the antibodies produced by a vaccine actually make future infections worse. The effect caused serious lung damage in animals given experimental vaccines for both Sars and Mers.John McCauley, director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, says it takes time to understand the particular challenges each vaccine throws up. “You don’t know the difficulties, the specific difficulties, that every vaccine will give you,” he says. “And we haven’t got experience in handling this virus or the components of the virus.”When the prime minister, Boris Johnson, told a No 10 press briefing that a vaccine was “by no means guaranteed”, his chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, agreed, but added: “I’d be surprised if we didn’t end up with something.” Many scientists share that view.Those in development draw on at least eight different approaches, from weakened and inactivated viruses to technologies that smuggle genetic code into the recipient’s cells, which then churn out spike proteins for the immune system to make antibodies against.Ideally, a vaccine will generate persistent, high levels of antibodies to wipe out the virus and also “T” cells to destroy infected cells. But each vaccine is different and today no one knows what kind of immune response is good enough.“We don’t even know if a vaccine can produce an immune response which would protect against future infection,” says David Heymann, who led the response of the World Health Organization (WHO) to the Sars epidemic.Early results from two frontrunner vaccines suggest they might have some use.The US biotech firm Moderna reported antibody levels similar to those found in recovered patients in 25 people who received its vaccine.Another vaccine from Oxford University did not stop monkeys contracting the virus, but did appear to prevent pneumonia, a major cause of death in coronavirus patients.If humans react the same way, vaccinated people would still spread the virus, but be less likely to die from it.How well a vaccine works determines how it is used. Armed with a highly effective vaccine that protects for several years, countries could aim for herd immunity by protecting at least two-thirds of the population.Coronavirus patients pass the virus on to three others, on average, but if two or more are immune, the outbreak will fizzle out. That is the best-case scenario.More likely is we will end up with a vaccine, or a number of vaccines, that are only partially effective.Vaccines that contain weakened strains of virus can be dangerous for older people, but might be given to younger people with more robust immune systems to reduce the spread of infection.Meanwhile, older people might get vaccines that simple prevent infections progressing to life-threatening pneumonia. “If you don’t have the ability to induce immunity, you’ve got to develop a strategy for reducing serious outcomes of infection,” says McCauley.But partially effective vaccines have their own problems: a vaccine that doesn’t stop the virus replicating can encourage resistant strains to evolve, making the vaccine redundant.Hopes for eliminating the virus start with a vaccine but do not end there. “If and when we have a vaccine, what you get is not rainbows and unicorns,” says Larry Brilliant, CEO of Pandefense Advisory, who led the WHO’s smallpox eradication programme. “If we are forced to choose a vaccine that gives only one year of protection, then we are doomed to have Covid become endemic, an infection that is always with us.”The virus will still be tough to conquer with a vaccine that lasts for years.“It will be harder to get rid of Covid than smallpox,” says Brilliant. With smallpox it was at least clear who was infected, whereas people with coronavirus can spread it without knowing. A thornier problem is that as long as the infection rages in one country, all other nations are at risk.As David Salisbury, the former director of immunisation at the Department of Health, told a Chatham House webinar recently: “Unless we have a vaccine available in unbelievable quantities that could be administered extraordinarily quickly in all communities in the world we will have gaps in our defences that the virus can continue to circulate in.”Or as Brilliant puts it, the virus will “ping-pong back and forth in time and geography”.One proposal from Gavi, the vaccine alliance, is to boost the availability of vaccines around the world through an “advance market commitment”. And Brilliant believes some kind of global agreement must be hammered out now. “We should be demanding, now, a global conference on what we’re going to do when we get a vaccine, or if we don’t,” he says.“If the process of getting a vaccine, testing it, proving it, manufacturing it, planning for its delivery, and building a vaccine programme all over the world, if that’s going to take as long as we think, then let’s fucking start planning it now.”People will have to adapt – and life will change. Heymann says we will have to get used to extensive monitoring for infections backed up by swift outbreak containment. People must play their part too, by maintaining handwashing, physical distancing and avoiding gatherings, particularly in enclosed spaces. Repurposed drugs are faster to test than vaccines, so we may have an antiviral or an antibody treatment that works before a vaccine is available, he adds. Immediate treatment when symptoms come on could at least reduce the death rate.Yuen Kwok-yung, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Hong Kong, has advised his government that all social distancing can be relaxed – but only if people wear masks in enclosed spaces such as on trains and at work, and that no food or drink are consumed at concerts and cinemas.At restaurants, tables will have to be shielded from each other and serving staff will follow strict rules to prevent spreading the virus. “In our Hong Kong perspective, the diligent and correct use of reusable masks is the most important measure,” he says.Sarita Jane Robinson, a psychologist who studies responses to threats at the University of Central Lancashire, says people are still adapting to the “new normal” and that without more interventions – such as fines for not wearing face masks – “we could see people drifting back to old behaviours”.We might become blase about Covid-19 deaths when life resumes and the media move on, but the seriousness of the illness will make it harder to ignore, she says.One last possibility could save a lot of trouble. Some scientists wonder whether the common cold coronaviruses crossed into humans in the distant past and caused similar illness before settling down. “If the virus doesn’t change there’s no reason to think that miraculously in five years’ time it won’t still cause pneumonia,” says Perlman. “But that’s the hope: that we end up with a much more mild disease and you only get a bad cold from it.”Heymann says it is too soon to know how the pandemic will pan out. “We don’t understand the destiny of this virus,” he says. “Will it continue to circulate after its first pandemic? Or will it, like some other pandemic viruses, disappear or become less virulent? That we do not know.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Just Transition Commissioner urges use of second site locations for coastal city businessDavis College pupils in Mallow, Co Cork, scoop top prize for work on plastic pollutionStrong backing for more ambition to address carbon emissions, according to poll"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259641.1590091041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin and covid 19 car restrictions more space for bikes bus restrictions in the offing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBus-users are likely to see the biggest change, with buses erted away from College Green. Large-scale bus ersions, restrictions on cars and a widespread reallocation of road space to pedestrians and cyclists are planned under a new Covid-19 strategy for Dublin city centre.A joint National Transport Authority (NTA) and Dublin City Council Covid-19 “mobility intervention programme” seeks to turn the heart of Dublin city from St Stephen’s Green to Mountjoy Square, and the Custom House to Stoneybatter into a “pedestrian, cyclist, public transport priority zone”.However, this will necessitate significant changes to the bus network, as well as the opening of off-street car parks on the outskirts of the city.Once activity returns to the city, bicycle-use is expected to triple and walking to double.Car-use is expected to fall by 30 per cent, but public transport is due to take a far bigger hit, with usage down by 80 per cent, largely due to social distancing requirements.The mobility programme identifies 14 key routes into the city centre where significant traffic changes will be implemented, in addition to the creation of the city centre priority zone.On all routes more space will be given to cyclists and pedestrians. In many cases this will involve the removal of on-street parking and reduction of the number of traffic lanes. In some cases it may involve “car-free” areas and the use of “bus gates” in places such as the Rathmines Road.AlternativesThe report concedes “more people will wish to travel by car”. However, it said while city centre car parks could remain open, alternatives to driving directly into the “core” were needed. This could include the establishment of car parks on the periphery from where people could walk or cycle.In some cases streets could be car-free if businesses on the street were to request it to use the space for queueing and tables.Bus-users are likely to see the biggest change, with buses erted away from College Green.Bus stops will also be distributed over a wider area, with some “removed completely” if social distancing cannot be achieved.“It is likely that passengers will be required, in some instances, to walk further to bus stops to ensure a safer spread of bus loading unloading.”The “emphasis is on rapid and temporary types of intervention”, with additions and adjustments expected over the coming months as measures are implemented.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study findsFifty brain teasers on all things natural from sealife to flora and what tofu is made of"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4260327.1590166565!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"midlands must be made green energy hub mulvey says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBog restoration and a climate change visitor centre are needed to transform the Midlands into a low-carbon economy, says Just Transition Commissioner Kieran Mulvey.The Midlands should become a major hub for renewable energy, and act as a second location for businesses based in coastal Irish cities, according to Just Transition Commissioner Kieran Mulvey. In his first progress report to the Government, Mr Mulvey underlines the importance of a major bog restoration programme and a centre for climate change to act as a visitor centre and chart the region’s transformation to a low-carbon economy. The report was published on Friday following a Cabinet meeting. Mr Mulvey was appointed last November after €30 million was allocated in the budget to support the region. This followed an earlier-than-anticipated ending of peat extraction operations by Bord na Móna – with a view to saving at least 1.25 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year up to 2027. “The Midlands must seek to position itself as a second-site location for coastal city-based businesses, and so must promote itself as a central, well-connected region with relatively lower operating costs than coastal cities. Second-site facilities must be developed throughout the region,” he suggests.The region should also build on its “enormous and immediate opportunities” in tourism by focusing on heritage, leisure activities – centred on its extensive waterways – and ecology. Peat harvestingHowever the report highlights a risk to peat harvesting this summer that could result in a €240 million hit to horticulture and food production businesses (including private peat producers). The planning permission required for extraction under environmental regulations has not yet been granted, the report says. “Horticultural peat would have to be replaced by import substitution at as yet an unquantified cost. The irony of replacing harvested peat from other EU countries should not be lost in these considerations,” he adds.A large number of projects are under way with potential for job creation, but the report underlines the need for urgency and a more streamlined approach between statutory bodies, fast-tracking of planning and funding to ensure completion.It details the deep impact already affecting the Midlands due to Bord na Móna getting out of peat production much faster than originally anticipated and two ESB peat-burning plants in Shannonbridge and Lanesboro closing later this year.A “whole of Midlands” approach is needed to ensure as many jobs in Bord na Móna and ESB are maintained, “in existing and new enterprises, and that new employment opportunities are created in the region”.In engagement with workers at Bord Na Móna sites and ESB plants, “the abiding impression is of a combined workforce, though well aware of the environmental and climate-related need to bring to an end the use of fossil fuels and peat for energy purposes”, in shock from the immediacy of closure decisions “and the real and current impact upon their livelihoods”. Transition periodWhat was expected to be a 10-year transition period “is now reduced to 12 months, and possibly shorter”. Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton said he was acutely aware of the impact an early exit from peat was having on workers and their families and on the Midlands more broadly – which was compounded by Covid-19. “Securing sustainable employment opportunities for the region and a just transition for those most severely affected must be at the heart of our response,” he said.A detailed implementation plan will be prepared, facilitated by a working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, in response to the recommendations. Accepting the need for urgent action in key areas, he launched the first call for proposals under the €11 million Just Transition Fund including retraining workers and proposals to generate sustainable employment in green enterprise in the region.Mr Bruton said improved governance arrangements would be put in place between all parties including the Midlands Regional Transition Team, and State agency lands and facilities identified for green energy projects.

File photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe .Bord na Móna has welcomed the first report by the Just Transition commissioner Kieran Mulvey which envisages the midlands turning away from peat and into a renewable energy hub. The company announced in November that it was exiting peat production at its two peat-powered generating plants at Shannonbridge, Co Offaly and Lanesboro, Co Longford by the end of this year in response to an accelerated transition for its staff. Reacting to the result, Bord na Móna chief executive Tom Donellan said Mr Mulvey’s report was an “apt reminder” of its contribution to the region and its future role in promoting the green economy. “The report notes the importance of our Brown to Green strategy that involves a €1.6 billion investment and development programme with a particular emphasis on green projects, using our landbank to help Ireland make progress on climate action,” he said. He stressed that Bord na Móna will remain a major employer in the midlands employing people through the accelerated development of its renewable energy assets most notably wind power. At least 300 people engaged in peat harvest will be deployed by the company in a peatland rehabilitation programme involving tens of thousands of hectares of peatland as a bioersity and as an amenity. Mr Donnellan said the Government, local authorities, the ESB and local training institutions will ensure that the future is not just a “retreat from peat but the dawn of a new, sustainable, green economy centred on the Midlands”. He also called on the Government to urgently address the loss in rates sustained by Offaly County Council, which will drop by 25 per cent, and in Longford by 15 per cent as a result of the power station closures. Mr Cowen said the next government must increase the money available through the Just Transition fund and that will be supported if Fianna Fáil are in power. “At every turn we’ve seen an acceleration of the decarbonisation process which far outstrips any investment in the midlands,” he said. “Everyone had been aware of the decarbonisation process. We knew what was coming, but no one was prepared for the brutal way in which it would be implemented, with blow after blow coming for workers in the midlands over the past number of years. “We know that to sit on our hands now would risk damaging the midlands for decades to come and potentially damage future efforts to decarbonise.

Photograph: Cultura Turismo VLLTwitter.In the long and melancholy roll of tragic Irish historical figures, they do not come much more tragic than Red Hugh O’Donnell. O’ Donnell, who was born in 1572, was according to a contemporary observer known not only by the “report of his beauty, his agility, and his noble deeds, but as a sworn foe to the Saxons of the Pale”. He and his father-in-law Hugh Mor O’Neill, who between them controlled large parts of the north of Ireland, started the Nine Years War to drive the English out of Ireland. It began so promisingly in 1593, but eventually ended in defeat following the siege and then the Battle of Kinsale in late 1601 and early 1602. A combined force of Spanish and Irish troops was defeated by the English in one of the worst military setbacks in Irish history, after which Red Hugh fled to Spain. There he hoped to again enlist the help of the Spanish king Philip III who promised to send another army to Ireland, but never delivered.O’Donnell died en-route to Valladolid, a city in northwestern Spain, in July 1602. Allegedly, he was poisoned by an Irish traitor James “Spanish” Blake. More contemporary scholars thinks he may have died from a tapeworm infection. He was only 29 years old. His brother Rory took over as Earl of Tyrconnell and left Ireland with Hugh O’Neill in 1607, an event known in Irish history as the Flight of the Earls . It marked the end of Gaelic Ireland. Red Hugh O’Donnell was buried within the Chapel of Wonders in the grounds of the Franciscan convent in Valladolid. The convent disappeared in 1836 and with it O’Donnell’s remains. More than four centuries after his death, the municipal authorities in Valladolid are excavating an area they believe is the final resting place of Red Hugh O’Donnell. They also hope to shed new light on the remains of an even more significant historical figure. Christopher Columbus, who in 1492 became the first European to discover the Americas, died and was buried in Valladolid in 1506. There remains a dispute to this day as to whether his remains are there, in Seville or in the Caribbean island of Santo Domingo. In a statement, Valladolid city council’s cultural department said finding the remains of O’ Donnell would be a “spur to the dissemination of this city abroad and also, of course, within Spain.“The burial in Valladolid of these two characters of such relevance to the world as is the case of Columbus and to relations between Spain and Ireland against their common enemy: England, demonstrate the importance of Spain and specifically of Valladolid for centuries”. A few years ago another team of archaeologists in Valladolid discovered an old plaque close to the site of the monastery. The current project is led by a team of Spanish archaeologists. They begun an excavation of Constitution Street on Monday. They are looking for the Chapel of Wonders and have found a wall where they believe the funeral chapel was located.They also located human bones, but not those of O’Donnell. They hope that his remains will be easy to identify as he lost toes on his foot from frostbite after he escaped from prison in 1592 and fled into the Wicklow mountains in the depth of winter.

But it leaves these key questions unanswered:Where will the checks be?Under the agreement, Britain is in the strange position of having the responsibility of enforcing the edge of the EU’s single market. To do this, the UK government paper says “no new infrastructure” will be required.However, according to British sources, this does not exclude the expansion of existing facilities at Belfast Airport, Belfast Port, and Warrenpoint. Moreover, extra inspections may be added to the current checks on animals that take place at Larne Harbour. Britain is set to inform the EU of its plans for these facilities by June.Britain proposes that checks on industrial goods are not necessary at the sea border and can take place through spot checks in shops and warehouses by agents employed by the Northern Ireland Executive. But as such goods could be driven directly from ports into the Republic and into the single market, this would appear to be a wide-open opportunity for smuggling, and the EU side is unlikely to agree to it.What about goods from the rest of the world?From January, the tariffs Britain applies on goods it imports from around the world will erge from EU tariffs. According to its new global tariff schedule, published this week, Britain will drop tariffs to zero on a number of products.Take the example of copper alloy tubes. The EU charges a 5 per cent tariff on imports of these from third countries with which it does not have a preferential trade deal. Britain says it will charge zero. Therefore, from January 1st smugglers could avail of a 5 per cent profit margin on copper alloy tubes from China if they can order them into Britain and then move them through the North into the Republic.How does Britain intend to prevent this? Its paper states that goods entering Northern Ireland will need “new electronic import declaration requirements, and safety and security information”. But if there are no border checks, how can these be verified?How are Irish goods told apart from Northern Irish ones?Britain stresses in its paper that there will be “no change to how Northern Ireland goods arrive in Great Britain ports compared to today”. It assures there will be no checks, and even “no additional process or paperwork”.However, a British source confirmed that goods from the Republic will be subject to checks, and that Irish companies will have to file an export declaration when selling into Britain.So how are Northern Ireland goods to be told apart from the goods of the Republic? Officials could not answer how products could be distinguished without any process or paperwork taking place.This potentially opens a hole to goods from anywhere in the EU accessing Britain’s market. An inability to guarantee the source of goods could be an issue as Britain tries to strike trade deals with new countries. It also raises fears among Northern Ireland businesses that their unique access into both the EU and Britain might not be so unique after all, and that they could be undercut.The question is further complicated in the case of goods that have components from both the Republic and Northern Ireland. To give one example, Baileys Irish Cream is a cross-Border hybrid. How would it be determined which part of the island goods originated from? Perhaps by estimating a percentage of their make-up? Officials couldn’t say."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4260338.1590170912!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet signs off on plans requiring mandatory location reporting for travellers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Harris said on Thursday that ‘the passenger locator form should be on a legal footing’.The Cabinet has signed off on plans to make it mandatory for travellers coming into Ireland to tell the State where they will be isolating for 14 days.Minister for Health Simon Harris said on Friday that living alongside the virus requires us “to do things differently.”From next week passengers arriving into a Ireland from abroad will be obliged to fill out a passenger locator form. Mr Harris said the measure will help ensure swift contact tracing if the person contracts Covid 19.Mr Harris said on Thursday that “at the moment the passenger locator form is on an administrative basis. A person is asked to fill it out. I believe it should be on a legal footing”.He said that conversations are ongoing with ministerial counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK about the potential measures.“Certainly, on a north, south, east and west basis this is a matter I have discussed with my counterpart in Northern Ireland and I know the Taoiseach has spoken publicly about his discussions with the British prime minister.He said the Irish position is that “we expect people, whether Irish or not, to self-isolate for 14 days. “This applies to anybody coming to the country, including returning Irish people. We also expect people to fill out a passenger locator form, indicating a name, phone number and where the person intends to stay for those 14 days.”The new regulations will come into effect from Thursday, May 28th and will remain in effect until June 18th, when they will be reviewed.Those who do not fill out the passenger locator form or who provide false details could face a fine of €2,500 or a prison term of six months.Mr Harris said: “These are extraordinary measures but they are necessary in a time of a public health crisis. “We continue to advise everyone against non-essential travel. However, if a person does arrive into Ireland, they will legally obliged to fill out this form, regardless of their nationality. “The form will be used to facilitate a system of follow up checks to make sure people who travel to the country are staying where they said that they would.

Photograph:  Christof  StacheAFP via Getty Images Even as Germany eases its Covid-19 restrictions, police are braced this weekend for the biggest wave yet of protests led by pandemic populists, left-wing anarchists, neo-Nazis and a celebrity vegan cook.Germany became a leader in combatting coronavirus through early testing and rapid contact-tracing, but pandemic fatigue has been a boon for German Covid-19 conspiracy theorists.Now chancellor Angela Merkel and her federal government are watching the protests closely, fearing a “pandemic Pegida” – a nod to the xenophobic, anti-Islam group that emerged during the 2015 refugee crisis.With Germany facing into a severe economic slump, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) hopes to channel that protest and boost its political fortunes after it slipped into single-digit support in recent weeks.From Stuttgart and Munich to Berlin and Hamburg, each lockdown Saturday has seen growing numbers of people defying the ban on public assemblies and ignoring social distancing guidelines to demand the reinstatement of their rights.BandwagonAs the weeks passed, far-left anarchist groups and far-right neo-Nazis have jumped on the bandwagon, jostling with anti-vaccination groups and Jewish World Conspiracy experts in the hope of scooping up new supporters.One of Germany’s highest Catholic clerics, Cardinal Gerhard Müller, based in the Vatican, has left believers flummoxed by signing a letter saying the Covid-19 restrictions “disproportionately and unjustifiably” undermine basic rights.Last weekend marches in several cities escalated, as far more people showed up than were registered by event organisers – or permitted to assemble under looser lockdown rules.Some 1,500 people showed up last weekend in Hamburg, instead of the registered 50, and the demonstration ended with scuffles, two injuries and police use of pepper spray.Leading the protests are prominent conspiracy theorists such as Ken Jebsen, a former broadcast journalist fired from Berlin outlet RBB over Holocaust denial.VaccinationOn his YouTube channel, which has 480,000 subscribers, he has led the campaign against Bill Gates and his wife Melinda. Their foundation is a world leader in vaccination programmes, a major contributor to the World Health Organisation and is helping to fund the search for a vaccine against Covid-19.In a video titled Gates Hijacks Germany, with 2.5 million views, Jebsen claims the Microsoft founder and his wife will impose a mass-immunisation programme on the world and now have “more power than Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler and Stalin together, in their day”.In a similar vein, Attila Hildmann, a successful vegan chef and cookbook author and the face of Berlin protests, claims that “Gates wants to set up a global health dictatorship above national governments”.Other theories circulating in Germany claim that Gates helped created the virus or wants to implant surveillance computer chips under people’s skin.Public hostilityAt protests in Berlin last weekend, some demonstrators carried signs reading “unvaccinated” and even yellow Stars of David. They liken public hostility to them, and their refusal to be vaccinated against Covid-19, to the social exclusion of Jews in the Nazi era.Researchers attribute the rise of conspiracy theorists to anxiety over the future, and the economic costs to families and business.But Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), says it has noted efforts by Russian broadcaster RT and others to stir up discontent over the Covid-19 measures.“We are seeing a trend that extremists, especially right-wing extremists, are exploiting the demonstrations,” said Thomas Haldenwang, BfV president. Herbert Reul, interior minister in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, has warned “there are a lot of wolves in sheep’s clothing trying to sneak into the middle of society with their anti-democratic slogans”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Long-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeCases in region limited to 17 with no deaths recorded thanks to effective quarantineDecree expected to spare lives of at least six men accused of taking part in Arab SpringStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

Conspiracy beliefs arguably travel further and faster than ever before.“Our survey indicates that people who hold such beliefs share them social media provides a ready-made platform.”“In the wake of the epidemic, mistrust looks to have become mainstream,” Prof Freeman added.The research project is funded by the NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside worlds largest refugee camp coronavirus takes hold","story":"Within the sprawling muddy corridors of the world’s largest refugee camp near Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, Rohingya refugees crammed into tiny huts and humanitarian aid workers are living in fear of a silent killer and bracing for the worst.Since the chilling news last week that Covid-19 had finally breached the Kutupalong camps housing almost 860,000 refugees, the number of confirmed infections had risen by Friday to 13, but a lack of available testing or the luxury of social distancing points to a much wider spread.People suffering from flu-like symptoms, high fevers and upper respiratory problems had been flooding into Save the Children clinics every day, Dr Ishaat Nabila, one of the agency’s medics told The .She added that while traffic into the clinics was similar to flu numbers last year, there was no way to tell if patients were suffering from Covid-19. The disease could be spreading undetected.Save the Children and other aid organisations are already preparing isolation and treatment centres for the most severe cases, but – with no ventilators in the camps and only 2,000 serving the entire 160-million-strong population of Bangladesh –  they fear being overwhelmed.“We are preparing for the worst… it is just the beginning and it will spread very fast because we have seen what has happened already in other countries. The health sector is working hard to mitigate this crisis,” she said.In such an unprecedented crisis, even health workers were afraid, she admitted. “I feel scared because it’s a crowded and congested camp and it’s difficult when people are not aware of the concepts of this pandemic…at the same time we also feel good that we are saving lives.”The spread of Covid-19 into the camps after months of trying to keep the pandemic at bay is another cruel blow for one of the world’s most persecuted and vulnerable communities.The vast majority arrived in Bangladesh after fleeing a vicious military-led ethnic cleansing campaign in their home in Myanmar’s Rakhine State in 2017.Traumatised and impoverished, they have since lived in squalor, with 40,000-70,000 squeezing into each square kilometre in small, ramshackle homes. Deprived of formal education or the means to earn a livelihood, they are dependent on aid and have had no route to escape the coming pandemic.Now a new terror has gripped the camps.“It’s scary because Covid-19 is an unknown disease and we don’t have any idea about it. I have a newborn baby and I heard that kids and old people can be easily affected. My mother is old so I am tense for her,” said Mohammad Nur, 25.“We are really afraid it will spread. I heard that tested people are kept in isolation but what will happen to the people they don’t track down? Some people stick to the rules and others do not,” he said.Ansar Ullah, an artist, said he was also frightened for his children. “Here in the camp, there is no space for social distancing even though that’s what we are told to do,” he said. “We do not usually go outside our home but how long can you stay in a tiny crowded house?”Aid agencies have long warned that the highly infectious disease could spread like wildfire through the camps.An alarming report by the Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins Centre for Humanitarian Health in April contained scientific modelling showing estimated infections would range from 119-504 in the first 30 days after an initial case, and between 424,798 and 543,647 in 12 months.Estimated deaths among the malnourished population, which generally has poor underlying health conditions and little access to good healthcare, ranged from 1,647 to 2,109 between low and high case scenarios. More than 31,500 refugees are believed to be aged 60 or older.“For a long time there has been a concern that if the virus spreads into the camp it is going to be catastrophic,” said Sudarshan Reddy Kodooru, Bangladesh country director for the British relief agency Tearfund. “Last week it did start... now the fear is that it will really multiply.”Tearfund has focused its aid efforts particularly on improving water sanitation, distributing household hygiene kits and educating refugees about the virus, Mr Kodooru said.A Bangladesh government internet ban in the camps has forced charity workers to use the more traditional means of leaflet dropping instead.The challenge was enormous and the fear rife, he said.“There is huge demand and need in the community and few resources,” said Mr Kodooru. “Life in the camps is always desperate, hopeless.”Manish Agrawal, Bangladesh Country Director at the International Rescue Committee, said strict curbs on access to the camps to keep the virus out had unfortunately deprived refugees of regular humanitarian assistance and limited opportunities to earn a daily wage.“This is increasing a lot of tensions at the household level and because IRC does a lot of protection monitoring we have come across many cases of gender-based violence, which is on the rise” he said. “This is really concerning.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new mother stunned archbishop canterbury arrives bedside bless","story":"It is hard to arrange a baby\u0027s blessing at the best of times – but it\u0027s even harder when coronavirus has shut churches across Britain.Yet one new mother managed not only to get her baby blessed but also to have it done by the Archbishop of Canterbury when she fell ill following the birth of her son.Ellen Eames, a 38-year-old vicar from London, was found to have dangerously high blood pressure at the end of her pregnancy and was admitted to St Thomas\u0027 Hospital last month. When her baby, Alexander, was born, she was told she needed to stay in hospital with him for a further eight days while staff worked to get her condition under control.With churches closed, Ellen knew it could be a long time until the newborn could get baptised and asked for a hospital chaplain to do the honours – and she was astonished when the Most Rev Justin Welby, the spiritual leader of the Church of England, arrived at her bedside. As The  revealed last week, Archbishop Welby, 64, has been regularly visiting patients to offer support with the chaplaincy team, wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. St Thomas\u0027 Hospital is just a short walk from the Primate of All England\u0027s flat at Lambeth Palace. Ellen said: Luckily my recovery from the birth was fine, but emotionally it was a very hard week for me and my husband Ken, who was spending his first week as a father at home by himself and wasn\u0027t allowed to visit us because of the outbreak.It made it extra special to have such an important visitor.

The rare hardback copy of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was found in a skip in 2008 by a teacher at school in Buckinghamshire, and stored in her loft.The copy was sold with four other books from the series, which had also been thrown away.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesJust 500 copies of The Philosopher’s Stone were printed in 1997. The book sold at auction had an estimated price of £8,000 to £12,000.Two first editions of The Philosopher’s Stone sold for £3,400 and £3,000, while first editions of The Chamber of Secrets and The Prisoner of Azkaban fetched £360. The auction took place online and by phone due to lockdown restrictions.Convenience Store Woman is a gothic love story with a capitalist kinkJK Rowling stuns fans by confirming real birthplace of Harry PotterFirst Harry Potter book read in full by Daniel Radcliffe and othersThe anonymous seller said: “To say I’m pleased is an understatement. Due to its condition, we thought £20,000 would be a good result. We watched the auction and the price just kept going up and up.”“I love books and reading and it just seemed awful to throw them away, so I picked up about five Harry Potter books,” she continued. “I thought they might be useful for my children or grandchildren in the future. It was better than seeing them go to waste.”JK Rowling recently revealed where she first started writing the Harry Potter books, contradicting fans who believed for years that Edinburgh was its birthplace.The Elephant House Cafe in Edinburgh is widely regarded as the place the now 54-year-old author wrote the first of the seven fantasy novels.While it is true that Rowling used to frequent the cafe in the early days of her writing career, the author revealed yesterday (21 May) that she actually started the series in London, in a flat above a sports shop in Clapham.Referring to the sign on Elephant House which reads “birthplace of Harry Potter”, Rowling tweeted: “I’d been writing Potter for several years before I ever set foot in this cafe, so it’s not the birthplace, but I *did* write in there so we’ll let them off!”Rowling then shared a picture of the Clapham flat where she started her writing process. “This is the true birthplace of Harry Potter,” she said. “If you define ‘birthplace’ as the spot where I put pen to paper for the first time.”Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0027s Stone\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But where they can’t, a range of further support will be available. People who are struggling and have not had a payment holiday will continue to be able to apply until 31 October.”Generally, mortgage interest still builds up during a payment holiday, unless the lender says otherwise. And the outstanding debt will still be owed by the borrower.Labour calls for suspension of rent payments for coronavirus affectedThis may mean a borrower might find they need to extend the length of their mortgage term when they come to the end of a payment holiday, in order to make sure their monthly payments are around the same level they were before.The FCA would still expect customers who can afford to return to full repayments to do so as this is in their best interests.At the end of a payment holiday, firms should contact their customers to find out if they can resume payments and if so, agree a plan on how the missed payments will be repaid.Firms are expected to engage with their customers and find out what they can repay and, for those who remain in temporary financial difficulty, offer further support.The FCA said payment holidays and partial payment holidays offered under this guidance should not have a negative impact on credit files.But it said people should remember that credit files are not the only source of information which lenders can use to assess creditworthiness.This guidance would also not prevent firms from providing more favourable forms of assistance to the customer, such as reducing or waiving interest.Economic secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: “Everyone’s circumstances will be different, so when homeowners can pay some or all of their mortgage, they should work with their lender on a plan but if they are still struggling, I want them to know that help is there.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The challenge now is to understand the processes in Earth\u0027s core driving theses changes.One possibility, according to the ESA, is that the weakening field is a sign that the Earth\u0027s magnetic field is about to reverse, whereby the North Pole and South Pole switch places.The last time a geomagnetic reversal took place was 780,000 years ago, with some scientists claiming that the next one is long overdue. Typically, such events take place every 250,000 years.Created with Sketch.\u0027Super bloom\u0027 of poppies visible from space: in pictures Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Satellite imagery shows the super bloom on Walker Canyon near Lake Elsinore in CaliforniaA woman sits in a super bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaMother and child among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaSatellite imagery shows the super bloom on Walker Canyon near Lake Elsinore in CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPeople sit in a super bloom of poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man stands among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA group of men take photos near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man walks among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA couple take a selfie among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA woman poses for a photo among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaSatellite imagery shows the super bloom on Walker Canyon near Lake Elsinore in CaliforniaA woman sits in a super bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaMother and child among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaSatellite imagery shows the super bloom on Walker Canyon near Lake Elsinore in CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPeople sit in a super bloom of poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man stands among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA group of men take photos near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man walks among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA couple take a selfie among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA woman poses for a photo among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaThe repercussions of such an event could be significant, as the Earth\u0027s magnetic field plays an important role in protecting the planet from solar winds and harmful cosmic radiation. Telecommunication and satellite systems also rely on it to operate, suggesting that computers and mobile phones could experience difficulties.The South Atlantic Anomaly is already causing issues with satellites orbiting Earth, the ESA warned, while spacecrafts flying in the area could also experience technical malfunctions.A 2018 study published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that despite the weakening field, Earth\u0027s magnetic field is probably not reversing.The study also explained that the process is not an instantaneous one and could take tens of thousands of years to take place.ESA said it would continue to monitor the weakening magnetic field with its constellation of Swarm satellites.The mystery of the origin of the South Atlantic Anomaly has yet to be solved, the space agency stated. However, one thing is certain: magnetic field observations from Swarm are providing exciting new insights into the scarcely understood processes of Earth\u0027s interior.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re always experimenting with future concepts using different hardware configurations as part of our proof-of-experience process” Bozworth also tweeted.Virtual reality is content computer-generated in three dimensions in a digital environment, while augmented reality – or mixed reality – is digital content layered over a real-world environment, such as Pokemon Go.The news comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that half of its workforce will likely work remotely over the next five to ten years.“We need to do this in a way that’s thoughtful and responsible, so we’re going to do this in a measured way, he said. But I think that it’s possible that over the next five to 10 years — maybe closer to 10 than five, but somewhere in that range — I think we could get to about half of the company working remotely permanently.“VR and AR is all about giving people remote presence.

The final ever scene of Lost is intercut between events on the island and an alternate timeline known as the flashsideways – scenes that replace the flashbacks and flashforwards for the entire final season.Lost turns 15: Every single episode ranked, from worst to bestThese flashsideways scenes come after Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell), stuck in the 1970s, detonates a hydrogen bomb in the closing moments of season five in an attempt to prevent the hatch from ever being built. The logic is that, should the hatch never be created, Oceanic Flight 815 will never crash on the island. The flashsideways show what would have happened had the plane landed safely in Los Angeles.All season long, viewers see the characters rubbing shoulders with one another in Los Angeles, unaware of the events of the past five seasons.Eventually, these characters are drawn together and begin to recall their time on the island, which leads to the final scene’s revelation: they are actually dead in the flashsideways, which is essentially a netherworld the survivors created in order to congregate so they can move on together to “whatever comes next”.So, to clear up the confusion: in the flashsideways scenes, these characters are dead. But no, they were not dead all along after the plane crashed.The flashsideways scenes depict an afterlife that the characters constructed for themselves due to the fact that their time on the island – which was completely real from start to end – was the most important part of their respective lives.The characters present in that final church scene are characters both dead and alive in island time, meaning several characters (including Kate, Sawyer and Claire) went on to live a full life beyond the series finale.These flashsideways scenes present a purgatory-of-sorts, where these characters come to when they eventually do die whenever that may be. When broken down, it’s a beautiful and reassuring depiction of the afterlife.The plane crash, the smoke monster, the hatch, the island – it was all real.Of course, it almost all ended rather differently...Find a ranking of every single Lost episode here\u0026nbspand check back tomorrow (23 May) for an oral history on the finale, with contributions from co-creator Damon Lindelof and actors Evangeline Lilly, Henry Ian Cusick and Jorge Garcia.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And the outstanding debt will still be owed by the borrower.Labour calls for suspension of rent payments for coronavirus affectedThis may mean a borrower might find they need to extend the length of their mortgage term when they come to the end of a payment holiday, in order to make sure their monthly payments are around the same level they were before.The FCA would still expect customers who can afford to return to full repayments to do so as this is in their best interests.At the end of a payment holiday, firms should contact their customers to find out if they can resume payments and if so, agree a plan on how the missed payments will be repaid.Firms are expected to engage with their customers and find out what they can repay and, for those who remain in temporary financial difficulty, offer further support.The FCA said payment holidays and partial payment holidays offered under this guidance should not have a negative impact on credit files.But it said people should remember that credit files are not the only source of information which lenders can use to assess creditworthiness.This guidance would also not prevent firms from providing more favourable forms of assistance to the customer, such as reducing or waiving interest.Economic secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: “Everyone’s circumstances will be different, so when homeowners can pay some or all of their mortgage, they should work with their lender on a plan but if they are still struggling, I want them to know that help is there.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The rocket can reach a height of approximately 100km, and carry a payload of up to 60kg.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It is very hard to oversell what we have achieved here with this test the whole team has pulled through again to deliver another UK first, said Dr Jack-James Marlow, who led the operations of Skylark L’s static fire testing.We have successfully static tested a fully integrated, sub-orbital Skylark L launch vehicle in flight configuration. This means we performed all actions of a launch but did not release the vehicle. The rocket engine successfully burned, with all vehicle systems showing nominal operation.”Trump says ‘space is the future’ at unveiling of Space Force flagAstronomers find ‘regular rhythms’ coming from distant starsSpace debris from failed rocket misses New York City by minutesSkyrora’s chief executive officer, Volodymyr Levykin said: “As the launch aspect of the UK’s new space industry starts to emerge, there will be many events that have never happened here previously and this is one of them. This was a mammoth effort in very trying circumstances, so it is quite an achievement to be proud of.”The company claims this is the first static fire test of its magnitude since the Black Arrow Programme, a three-stage British satellite carrier rocket that was used for four launches between 1969 and 1971.In September 1970, the Black Arrow attempted to carry a British satellite, Orba, into space, but failed to reach orbit. The next year, however, it did carry the Prospero satellite into space, which made the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit via a carrier rocket.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some countries’ emissions dropped by as much as 26 per cent on average during the peak of the confinement.Visualising the biggest carbon crash ever recordedIf pre-pandemic conditions return by mid-June, then 2020 emissions could decline by a more modest 4 per cent compared to 2019, though this would still be the largest single annual decrease in absolute emissions since the end of World War II.A UN report last year said emissions needed to drop by 2.7 per cent a year keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 7.6 per cent a year to keep below 1.5C.“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” said lead author Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia.“These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary, however, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport, or energy systems,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPrevious analysis of data from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency revealed the unprecedented scale of the emissions decline.China saw the largest drop in emissions in April, followed by the United States, Europe and India.In the countries with the strictest lockdown restrictions, emissions from aviation plunged 75 per cent in early April, while emissions from land transport fell by 50 per cent and from power generation by 15 per cent.Emissions from industry declined by around 35 per cent, with a lack of data causing some uncertainty. Emissions from residential buildings, however, increased by 5 per cent, the study said.“The emissions reductions occurring because of Covid-19 will clearly be unprecedented. What is less certain is how the economy will rebound in late 2020 and 2021,” said Glen Peters at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway, which took part in the study.“As different countries and sectors recover, it is unclear if activity levels will return to normal levels or if we may see permanent shifts in behaviour,” he added.The environmental impact of coronavirus containment measures has also led to a huge reduction in air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, which are released by cars, aeroplanes and other combustion engines.Satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed a dramatic decrease in NO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They will go on sale shortly.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It’s great to be able to help people in need by creating digital images, especially since most people aren’t allowed out in the world during the lockdown,” he said.“I’ve made the postcards so that everyone has a chance to own one, and all the profits will be donated to charity.How to support our campaign“It feels right to show what can be done from a lockdown situation with a bit of computer magic and lateral thinking.”The images show the butterfly heart design, which was created by the artist for our appeal as a symbol of “solidarity and hope”, being superimposed on buildings in London and across the country, including the Tower of London, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey.The limited-edition print of the rainbow butterfly image can be purchased in two sizes, priced at £300 and £1,000. The larger version of the image, which is filled with butterflies, one of Mr Hirst’s motifs, is 70cm by 72.7cm and the smaller one is 35cm by 36.4cm.The funds raised will go to our appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s biggest surplus food distributor.The number of editions ordered before sales close on Monday will determine the final size of the edition.

The R number must stay below 1 in order for the government to ease the lockdown.If the figure is above one, the virus will spread exponentially. An R number of less than one indicates the virus is in decline.Boris Johnson has said ministers would reimpose controls if the value started to pick up again.Announcing his “road map” out of lockdown, the prime minister said: “We must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease – the R – back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Schools have been closed since March  - three days before the Prime Minister announced a nationwide lockdown.No has also confirmed that parents would not be finedthey chose to keep their kids at home over concerns for their safety.A spokesman for No said: While we will not penalise [parents] for keeping children at home, once children are eligible toto school we will strongly encourage them to do so.Dr Bousted urged the Government to meet tests set out by unions, which includes extra money for deep cleaning and personal protective equipment and local powers to close schoolsclusters of infections break out.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on May  it was completely natural for parents to worry about sending their kids back to school. No has also confirmed that parents would not be finedthey chose to keep their kids at home over concerns for their safety.ltgtOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It might feel strange at first, but we’ll get used to it.Militant unions telling teachers they should refuse to go back to work must also urgently rethink their stance.Reopening schools is obviously essentialwe are to prevent the poorest and most vulnerable children falling behind — new research reveals that better-off children are spending a whopping  per cent more time each day on education than those from poorer homes.But as parents can only go back to work once their kids are in class, it’s also the only way to kickstart the economy.Of course, there will always be an element of risk to getting society up and running again. Even before coronavirus, it would have been impossible for anyone to guarantee the safety of every worker every day.But the Government has stressed it’s “extremely unlikely” a school could be the source of a Covid- outbreak.And given the risks frontliners take every single day, that assurance should be good enough for teaching unions.WE welcome the news that the Government plans to push ahead with legislation to end free movement and replace it with a points-based immigration system before the end of this year.The new system is exactly what Brexit-voting Sun readers wanted: it will let us welcome the brightest and best — including doctors, nurses and carers — to the UK based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.And it’s logical to get it introduced quickly so businesses have time to prepare before the transition period ends.Let’s hope MPs have the sense to back the bill.WE can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds now the Government looks set to hit its target of recruiting , contact-tracers by the end of next week.It’s been obvious for a long time that widespread testing and tracing is the best way to contain the virus: all the countries that have fared best have been doing it from the start.But thanks to dodgy advice from Public Health England, Boris and his ministers gave up on it back in March.What a relief they’ve finally seen the light.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially my track, Alive.”The music didn’t disappoint, either, ranging all the way from the excellent Icelandic entry, Think Of Things, to knock-kneed techno from some Russian live-wires called Little Big.My personal highlight, though, was the nutty Latvian bird, Samanta Tina, who turned up for her promotional video wearing a PPE mask and squirting a bottle of disinfectant everywhere.If ever it got a bit too “Eurovision”, though, there was a special guest on hand to calm the mood down.Sweden’s Mans Zelmerlow sang Heroes in his back garden , Italy’s Diodato slowly murdered Volare in a CGI amphitheatre and Ireland’s Johnny Logan had either aged quite dramatically or had to be replaced, right at the last second, by Julian Assange on the poignant What’s Another Year.The one constant, though, was Norton, who handled Eurovision’s new socially-distanced, time-delayed, non-competitive format as brilliantly as he did the old one and was in no mood to spare feelings.“Samanta Tina. She’s tried to represent Latvia six times, Lithuania twice and now she’s got through it’s been cancelled. You’d think she’d take the hint, wouldn’t you.”“Serbia’s answer to The Pussycat Dolls, when the question is — name a group that isn’t as good as The Pussycat Dolls ”It was a joy to watch after seeing so many hosts and shows fail spectacularly with “the new normal” and my only real complaint was that there wasn’t enough of him or the event.I wanted a vote as well, of course. But by the time I was ready for Norton to annihilate the regional juries, it was all over.Lesson learned, though. If I ever take this event for granted or complain about the running time again, you have permission to shoot me down in righteous flames.Meantime, stay hellzy.The Real Marigold Hotel, Britt Ekland: “I look in the mirror — it’s OK.

a maelstrom of confusion over what to do about the family holiday they booked when coronavirus was still but a glint in China’s eye.You can go to France but will have to quarantine for two weeks when

toll from Covid-, everyone unaffected knows they’re lucky to even be alive.So it’s not the “First-World problem” of having to cancel a holiday that’s the issue.It’s the potential loss of big money — on top of what they’ve already lost during lockdown — that’s worrying people.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s declaration that summer holidays are “very unlikely” doesn’t help one bit when it comes

could rule that holidays on the continent are allowed and you only have to self-isolate on you show symptoms of the virus.But this “wait and see” middle ground is helping no one.Thank God for that.My

It became the country with the highest death rate per capita from Covid- in Europe during thesevendays to May .The lockdown has unquestionably saved lives.LAST Friday night I was called  times in the space of an hour by the SAME NUMBER.What’s more, my phone told me the call was coming from Tajikistan. But every time I tried to answer, the caller hung up. That’s totally unfair.I have never in my le spoken to a person from Tajikistan. And I would very much like to do so. It might be interesting.I’m sure it was a criminal of some kind, but that’s not the point.I wanted to knowmy caller was a member of the mysterious Yaghnobi people, who live in the mountains in the north of the country, with their many goats. That would have been exciting.I might start ringing up numbers in Tajikistan indiscriminately. And then move on to Kyrgyzstan.That’s what lockdown does to you.For this they have been attacked by “human rights activists”.Perhaps.But not by the people of Hungary, who fully agree with this measure.Much as I suspect people would over here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

when they moved tactic from containing coronavirus to delaying the peak.They argue it has worked in other countries like Singapore and South Korea, helping to keep infection and death rates down.Now, Boris Johnson has pledged to have a world class system in place by June , to help ease lockdown measures further.There are two key strains to the operation - human tracers, and the NHS app.So far, , contact tracers have been hired to manually track down people who have been near others who have contracted Covid-.Contact tracing works by stopping the spread of coronavirus through a community.The idea is that by isolating an infected person you can stop the chain of transmission.Experts have explained the premise using persons A, B, C, D and E as an example.Professor Keith Neal, from Nottingham University, has  years experience of contact tracing and infectious diseases and says such programmes are in place to disrupt chains of transmission.“Were already doing that in part by people working at home, people are actually socially distancing, he told Radio s Today Programme.If anybody is infected, they are meeting less people.“Once we find somebody who has been infected the whole point of the contact tracing is identying person A who has the infection, who will have passed it on to person B.“Then B will have passed it on to C, C to D and so on.“The idea is we identy B from A to stop C, D and E becoming infected and it all adds up to reducing the rate of infections across the country.”Professor Neal added thatmost people have followed the rules and have successfully been social distancing, then the tracing shouldn’t be “particularly dficult”.He said person B is the key, and that by identying them quickly - and asking that they self-isolate for  days - you can bring the virus under control.So far in the UK more than , people have died from the coronavirus, while more than , Brits have tested positive for Covid-.When the Government abandoned contact tracing in March, they quickly moved to introduce measures including social distancing to help delay the peak of the epidemic, and stop the spread.Social distancing and hand washing remain the best tools in fighting the virus, scientists agree.Prof Neal said social distancing can also help speed up contact tracing.He said given the lockdown, most Brits are very aware of who they are mixing with - and in most cases it is just their household.So, in most cases person B will be quickly identied as a family member, or house mate.The NHS app, which is unlikely to be ready for June , is only really needed when people dont know who theyve been in contact with.Prof Neal said: If you have gone to a supermarket thats where the app comes in.It will help to identy who youve been in contact with, when you dont actually know their name or phone number.“Thecomplement each other.Prof Neal said track and trace can be done without the app.Downing Street had originally planned to hire , tracers, but the opposition criticised the figure, saying it would be too small a team.The app that will accompany the tracing is not yet ready and questions have been raised as to how the tracers can successfully do their jobthe app is not yet up and running.Downing Street said any contact tracing that requires clinical expertise will be carried out by staff with specic trainingthey have never worked in the healthcare sector.As part of the roll out , households will be recruited and routinely tested over  months.Ultimately, , participants will be involved in the study.High accuracy antibody tests will be used to understand how immunity could work in those recovering from the disease.Those taking part will be swab-tested and asked questions by a health worker during a home visit.The tests will be repeated every week for five weeks, and then monthly for a year.On May  the first app was launched on the Isle of Wight with a second app on its way.The pilot on the Isle of Wight is still ongoing, Number  said today.The app monitors when users come into contact with people who may have Covid-.It is able to identy people that the person using the app may not know personally, such as a bus driver, postal worker or supermarket staff.Professor Neal added: We can do contact tracing even without the app because thats the matter of finding the most high risk contacts - its close and prolonged contact and you tend to and should only have close and prolonged contact with people you actually know.The app will work by using Bluetooth to log when another user’s smartphone has been in close proximity.If a person develops Covid- symptoms, they can report their symptoms to the app and immediately organise a test.The tech automatically sends out an anonymous alert to other users they may have infected, urging them to self-isolatenecessary – thus stopping further spread.They will then have the ability to book a coronavirus test.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had previously said the Isle of Wight was chosen for the trial of the app due to its population size.On initial launch of the app residents complained of issues such as the app notying them with multiple alerts and download dficulties.Number  said they were still working on ironing out the issues and a spokesperson for the Prime Minister said: The intention is to roll the app out in the coming weeks but Ive also said there is certainly no requirement to have the app in order to have an effective trace and system, which the PM spoke about, in place by June .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It doesn’t fit the media narrative of Sturgeon the superstar. Likewise, Scotland has had far more deaths in care homes than England when adjusted for population.And Sturgeon has an even bigger issue when it comes to Scotland’s anaemic testing operation.The country has a much higher rate of Covid- per head than England and has been carrying out just a quarter of the tests England has per capita. Truly dire.So who has emerged as Sturgeon’s knight in shining armour Her bête noire, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who this week announced anyone in the UK with symptoms can receive a test from the NHS.As for those lockdown-lting measures from Boris that pious Sturgeon used for maximum media impact, including a farcical suggestion from her party to introduce a police border between Scotland and England — knock me down with a feather! — she’s only gone and followed suit a week later.Sturgeon’s behaviour in the midst of a genuine international health emergency has been unseemly.But with enemies in her own party circling over her complete failure to push forward the independence cause, expect to see more desperate stunts in the weeks to come. The media should be wise to her tricks.But maybe BBC bosses are finally listening. Five months after I wrote in this column that axing BBC had been disastrous and BBC should have been cut instead, they are now doing a U-turn to make that very change.Right. Time for a  wishlist then. Can EastEnders and Have I Got News For You be chopped next  Oh, and The Mash Report and Newsnight too.But I’ll take two series of The Apprentice a year instead.APPARENTLY it’s only OK to be gayyou’re a raving Corbynista Remoaner.That’s particularly offensive to yours truly – but the only message to take from the shocking cancellation of the Virtual Pride festival this week.Big names from Dannii Minogue to Andrew Lloyd Webber were due to appear during the ten-hour online extravaganza, organised to replace the ious gay gatherings that are usually held over summer.But then, all of a sudden, the event was axed.The organiser, it was claimed, had committed a cardinal sin.Racism  Nope.Sexism  Definitely not.Breaking draconian lockdown restrictions  Hell no.It turns out that Charlie Shakespeare was actually a Brexit supporter who had – shock horror! – liked tweets by Nigel Farage and The Spectator’s associate editor Toby Young.Corbyn adviser Linda Riley, the publisher of Diva magazine, tweeted: “Any LGBTQ event which supports the likes of these will not have my support. #proudtobeapoliticalbigot.”This sort of persecution of an LGBT ally by the London liberal media elite – simply because he harbours a dferent political view – is a disgrace.Just like any other group in society, the gay community is politically erse.And militant LGBT activists should realise we will only achieve true acceptance by embracing this ersity.As well as being an accurate accolade, it’s an apt choice for the lockdown era. “Couldn’t escapeI wanted to . . . ”WHAT does public le in the UK look like without appearances from the Queen Not a prospect I’ve ever wanted to consider, but one growing more and more likely as the -year-old continues to shelter at Windsor Castle with just a skeleton staff.What a tragedyan unexpected consequence of this ghastly pandemic from China is the greatest British monarch of all-time being forced to remain locked away from her adoring public.While far lesser royals might be able to stay front-of-mind with Zoom calls and ious other stunts filmed on mobile phones, that would be unbecoming of the Queen, who has always picked her moments to emerge in public with decorum and class.The idea of regular TV or other media addresses isn’t right either.There is a reason there have only been a handful over the course of her reign. They really mean something.But as a loyal subject, I concur that the health of Her Majesty – deep into the most vulnerable age group – matters more than anything .In a perfect world, I like to imagine she is enjoying the retirement with the Duke of Edinburgh she probably never thought she would have.“Put the kettle on please, Phil.

brought in to help businesses forced to shut up shop during lockdown - gives cheap loans of up to £, to small businesses across the nation with minimal credit checks.Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced thatbusinesses fail to pay back the loans  per cent of the losses will be paid for out of public coffers.Thousands of firms who took money through the scheme could wind up in court to be chased for the loans and many more will fold even with the massive spending Mr Sunak has brought in to keep businesses afloat.But  per cent of businesses in the survey said they did not believe they would be chased for the debt and a further  per cent warned they would not be in a strong enough financial position to pay it back.Banks, who were ordered by ministers to hand out loans for the Bounce Back scheme, could wind up with unsustainable debt because businesses did not have to go through the usual rigorous credit checks.Chairman of BBRS Lewis Shand-Smith said: The Business Banking Resolution Service will not have access to a ‘magic wand’ to wish away unpaid loans.”Lenders have been told they should pursue firms which default on loans just as forcefully asthey were regular loans.A spokesman for banking trade body UKFinance said: It is important to remember that any financing provided under the government-backed schemes is a debt not a grant and will need to be repaid in full by the borrower over the term of the loan.All businesses should consider carefully their repayment obligations before completing an application.According to data from UKFinance, £billion in loans has been given out to almost half a million businesses through Government schemes since the start of the crisis.Over £billion has been handed out through Bounce Back loans and another £billion through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme which is aimed at slightly larger firms and has stricter rules.The Government could wind up paying almost £. billion of the loans out at the taxpayers expense as national debt is expected to balloon to £billion by the end of next year.Partner at business advice firm Flint Global Giles Wilkes warned bankers will be hesitant to pursue businesses who default on payments.He said: If the BBRS survey is anything to go by, a great number of its recipients do not expect or even intend to pay back, and given the banking sector has little skin in the game, we might not expect the bankers to be knocking on their doors asking for money back.If the government ends up being the creditor, I am doubtful that it will want to turn into the demanding bailf to hundreds of thousands of hard-pressed entrepreneurs.We wont know for a few years, but I would be surprisedthe great bulk of these loans are repaid in full.The Treasury declined to comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Going into lockdown was a shock to our system but coming out was always going to be the challenge.The police are only there to uphold the law.

are ‘key workers’ across the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics.This includes NHS and social care staff, but also an army of other workers including bus and train drivers, supermarket staff, police and some council staff.Hardline unions had drawn up a list of  health and safety demands before teachers go back to class.One of the sticking points is having a robust contact tracing system in place -

I think they intend it to help to provide trust in what they are saying. And quite rightly so.Basically what we in the scientic community do is give the best advice we can based on the evidence thats available to us.We then pass it to government ministers and the policy parts of government who can then take that and do with it what they like within the policy context.Sir Ian, who was the chief scientic adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from -, said SAGE meetings are currently taking place over Zoom.More than  people sit on SAGE - the UKs top advisory team of elite experts who step in to inform British leadership when making decisions.The names of those in the group were published in early May after officials bowed to mounting pressure to reveal who had been part of regular meetings during the pandemic.The names on the list included well-known figures who have been involved in the daily press conferences, including chairman Sir Patrick Vallance, Professor Chris Whitty and his deputies Dr Jenny Harries and Professor Jonathan Van Tam.Sir Ians claim comes after research this week claimed launching the UKs lockdown a week earlier would have saved tens of thousands of lives.The study, carried out by Dr John Dagpunar, from the University of Southampton, suggested implementing lockdown on March  rather than March  could have limited the number of deaths to ,.Dr Dagpunars study considered the number of people infected with the virus, its rate of reproduction, hospital bed and staff capacity, and the proportion of patients who die, among other factors.And, using an algorithm based on the timing of the UKs outbreak, Dr Dagpunar found thatlockdown had started a week earlier there could have been a very large reduction in deaths.The virus would have infected four per cent less of the population in this scenario , the study said, and the demand for hospital beds would have been lower.Dr Dagpunar said: In hindsight [this] clearly illustrates that earlier action was needed and would have saved many lives.Literally, each day’s delay in starting suppressioncan result in thousands of extra deaths.The same is true for premature relaxation, acknowledging that the rate of decline is less than the rate of growth, so the effect although severe is not quite as strong.These conclusions are the incontrovertible consequence of the exponential growth and decline of a managed epidemic.Dr Dagpunars paper was published on the website medRxiv without being peer-reviewed by other scientists.Around two thirds of people think the Government took too long to put the UK in lockdown, according to polls.However, other experts say ministers lost sight of the evidence and rushed into lockdown, praising Sweden for holding its nerve and not shutting down the economy.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their risk of death or severe infection is extremely low.The balance of risk is strongly toto school.Even though experts say children shouldto school, experts acknowledged that social distancing would be hard to maintain and also said parents have a responsibility to remain vigilant.Prof Chris Bonell highlighted that it was also important that contact between parents at the schools gates was also assessed.The level of contact tracing will be the key thing for opening schools, we will need to knowmeasures are working, but teachers wont have time to be filling out questionnaires to help with this.Guidance on whether or not people in the UK should be wearing face masks has been a widely debated issue.While there is little evidence to back up claims that masks can protect you from becoming infected - experts say they can stop an infected person from spreading the disease.Current advice from the UK government states that you should wear a face covering or maskyou take public transport oryou go to a supermarket.You do not have to wear them when you are exercising.But the Government does suggest face masks are not suitable for very young children.Government advice states: “Face-coverings should not be used by children under the age of two, or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly, for example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.”As it stands the children ing to school will all be of primary age and the advice would mean that they do not have to wear them.But as inidual schools have rebelled against the governments plans saying they will not open schools, it may be that inidual head teachers and local councils make these decisions for their schools.The government states: Schools and other education or childcare settings should therefore not require staff, children and learners to wear face coverings.Changing habits, cleaning and hygiene are effective measures in controlling the spread of the virus.The coronavirus lockdown has affected everyones normal routine.Many parents are at home with their children all day and for many kids, it might be hard to understand whats going on.This sht in routine has seen many children struggle as they are away from their peers and from their normal lives.But older children, who are more aware of the situation may feel uncomfortable about going back to school.Many children are aware of the virus and the changes around them but its important to talk to your children about what they should expect when ing to schools and what the pandemic means.Dr Lucy Viney from The Fitzrovia Psychology Clinic in London said parents shouldt be afraid to discuss the pandemic with their children.Your goal is to help your child feel informed and get fact-based information that is likely to be more reassuring than whatever they’re hearing from their friends or on the news.. Do not be afraid to discuss the coronavirus with your child: Your goal is to help your child feel informed and get fact-based information that is likely to be more reassuring than whatever they’re hearing from their friends or on the news.. Allow your child space to share their worries and fears: For example, you could say: “I understand that all these changes are making you feel worried. It’s OK to feel worried when everything seems dferent. I’m so pleased you have let me know how you’re feeling”.. Identy non-verbal opportunities for emotional expression: For example, it can be helpful to draw pictures of things that your child has noticed each day or to ask them to choose some music to listen to together that reflects how they are feeling.. Focus on what you’re doing to stay safe and healthy, such as hand-washing: This is empowering for children because it gives them tools and knowledge to help keep themselves and others safe, and something that they can focus on.. Establish a daily routine: It can be helpful to integrate activities that you used to do before the coronavirus outbreak, such as eating together, watching a TV show or going to for an evening walk.. Find regular opportunities for meaningful conversations: If possible, try to find an opportunity each day to spend between - minutes of ‘special time’ with each of your children. The basic premises of ‘special time’ are that you specy theof timeand the location, and your child chooses the activity.   This ‘special time’ should be free from any external distractions, such as phone calls.. Look after your mental wellbeing too: Practice self-care and invest in your own wellbeing. It’s important to remember that you can only do what you can manage at this time and that every day doesn’t have to be ‘perfect’.Dr Lucy added that you need to allow your child space and time to reflect on how they are feeling.For example, you could say: I understand that all these changes are making you feel worried.It’s OK to feel worried when everything seems dferent. I’m so pleased you have let me know how you’re feeling.She added that you should also make sure your child is aware of the ious hygiene principles such as hand washing and social distancing,they see you actively doing these activities they will be more inclined to do them for themselves.During this time its easy to think you are being over protective of your childrenyou dont want to send them back to school.But youre not alone, as a recent survey suggested that parents do not want lockdown to be lted until September, meaning many dont want their kids to go back until the next school year.Two in three parents believe lockdown should stay in place until at least June, with . per cent saying the lockdown should remain until September, according to a UK-wide poll of , parents led by learner provider, Exemplar Education.Its important that you address these worries and each parent should assess their situation inidually, whats right for you might not always be right for your friends and neighbours.Dr Lucy highlighted that its important for parents to make sure their own mental health needs are catered for during this time.This is while Steve O’Hara, director of education for Exemplar Education said: “The Covid- pandemic has had an unbelievable impact on the day to day lives of families everywhere.Parents and children are in unfamiliar territory and trying their very best to face the challenges that learning from home brings.It’s vital for parents to be able to talk freely about these challenges and to take care of their own mental wellbeing over the course of the lockdown.Sharing worries will help all of us feel less stress and concerned and help us take some of the pressure off.”One big concern during this time is that children would miss out on vital education.Downing Street published Sage documents that do warn the effects of lockdown could affect childrens education and work prospects for the rest of their lives.While many schools have provided home schooling resources, some households may not be able to access them, while other parents may not feel comfortable home schooling their kids.As many as . per cent of parents reported dficulties in supporting their children with learning from home.In a clear sign that many parents nationwide are feeling the strain a further . per cent said they do not feel equipped to support their children’s learning.Mr OHara added: Many are extremely concerned about lockdown coming to an end too suddenly, yet are anxious about their children’s learning and their own personal ability to support them at home.While some children will be missing out on the education aspect of the lockdown, others will also be struggling in the constrained social environment.The education secretary earlier this month warned of dire consequences to learningchildren did notto school.Gavin Williamson said that children stand to lose more by staying away from schools.Reassuring parents that schools would be made safe he said: School staff can already be tested for the virus, but from the first of June well extend that to cover children and their familiesany of them develop symptoms.This is while Labours Rebecca Long-Bailey this week said that children in older age groups should not be forced to catch up on what they have missed out on during the lockdown period.Speaking to TES she said: “What we are going to see when we get back to the classroom is those students who are in families where their parents are lucky enough be able to afford tutors, or those who can hothouse, will catch up very quickly.And everybody  won’t be able to do that, and then you’ve got a whole generation of pupils who could fall through the cracks and their prospects will be affected and they won’t be able to get jobs in the future.”During the lockdown, many nurseries, like schools have remained open to support parents of children who are key workers.Many have been running at a limited capacity, but workers are still generally having the same amount of contact with children as they did before.Busy Bees – which has  centres across the UK and Ireland – has confirmed its health and safety plans will not include those stringent measures.Kids will be able to play in smaller groups and teachers will work on iding children into close friendship groups to limit the number of people they come into contact with.They will also reduce the space that children can explore and increase the time they spend outdoors.Playdough, sandpits and water games will be banned in a bid to prevent the killer bug from spreading around nurseries.All children and staff will have their temperature checked upon arrival, and those families waiting to enter the nursery will be asked to wait two metres apart at drop off and pick up.Regular temperature checks for both children and team members will continue throughout the day, as will frequent handwashing and disinfecting of communal areas. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today the Department of Health reported  deaths due to Covid- - the lowest toll on a Friday for eight weeks.A Government spokesman today confirmed the R rate is still somewhere between . and one.Last Friday, SAGE experts announced it had crept up slightly from . to ..It means, the worst case scenario is that the epidemic is not shrinking but rather is stable.The R value - or reproduction rate - is the average number of people an infected person spreads the virus to.It can indicate whether the epidemic is getting bigger or smaller - an R rate of above one indicates a growing epidemic, while less than one suggests the outbreak is shrinking.Deaths, infection rates and hospital admissions are all falling across the UK and a Government source today said that the spread of the virus in the community has been very much reduced.They added that the rate of infection in care home settings is responsible for keeping the R rate high.A Government source said: “The epidemic is going down in every part - so numbers are down in terms of infections, hospital admissions, ICU beds and overall mortality.“If you look at it now in terms of overall mortality - in terms of excess deaths - its right, right down to a sort of winter-type picture.But the continued rates of infection from care homes and hospital settings, which are coming back into the community, keep that high.At the peak of Britains outbreak, the R rate is thought to have reached three - forcing the country into lockdown, to suppress the spread and flatten the peak.Scientists use it to predict how far and how fast a disease will spread - and the number can also inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that every sick person will pass the disease on to three other peopleno containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadly.The strict stay at home measures helped push that number down below one - ying in dferent regions.Over the last two weeks lockdown measures across the country have been eased, with more people going to work and others meeting for socially distanced catch ups in outdoors spaces.So far in the UK more than , people have died from the virus.But the fact that the R rate has remained steady means the UK could be entering into stable territory.There were  deaths recorded in the UK yesterday - the lowest figure on a Thursday since March  when  deaths were reported.The R rate is likely to be affected by a slight lag, due to a lag in the governments mathematical modelling.Boris Johnson first relaxed the measures on May  but highlighted thatthe R rate was to rise then strict measures would have to be implemented once again.Ministers have been faced with a balancing act between keeping the R value and death rate down - and ensuring that Britains economy does not totally collapse.The PM made only small tweaks to the lockdown rules earlier this month when people were encouraged toto workthey couldnt do their job from home.Unlimited exercise was also put back on the cards while iniduals are now free to meet one person from another household at a safe distance outdoors in a park.Scientic experts have been advising the Government on how each option for unlocking the country could affect the R value. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They dont do squats all the time but they just dont gain weight.Everybody studies obesity and the genetics of obesity - we thought, Lets just turn it around and start a new research field. Lets study thinness.In particular, through experiments on mice and fruit flies, Prof Penninger discovered that the ALK gene played a role in nerve cells in the hypothalamus region of the brain, which helps to regulate appetite.This, in turn, appeared to influence part of the sympathetic nervous system and resulted in changes in how fat stores were used where in the body.Deleting the gene created mice that stayed thin, even when fed an ultra high-calorie diet. Similarly, it made fruit flies lighter.There is currently a high demand for new therapies to tackle obesity - particularly following the revelation that obesity doubles the risk of needing hospital treatment for coronavirus.And more than six in ten adults in the UK are overweight and one in four is obese.Professor Penninger believes ALK could one day be targeted with drugs to give people a better chance of staying a healthy weight.BMI is a measure of whether youre a healthy weight for your height. You can use the NHS BMI healthy weight calculator to work out your score.For most adults, a BMI of:BMI is not used to diagnose obesity because people who are very muscular can have a high BMI without much fat.But for most people, BMI is a useful indication of whether theyre a healthy weight.A better measure of excess fat is waist size, which can be used as an additional measure in people who are overweightor moderately obese .Generally, men with a waist size of cm or more and women with a waist size of cm or more are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems.Source: NHSThe gene has also been shown to play a part in cancer and compounds have been developed to dampen down its activity.Its realistic that we could shut down ALK and reduce ALKto seewe did stay skinny, he wrote in his paper, which was published in the journal Cell.ALK inhibitors are used in cancer treatments already. Its targetable. We could possibly inhibit ALK, and we actually will try to do this in the future.Despite this, other researchers cautioned that tinkering with ALK could have unwelcome side-effects and said that convincing genetic studies of weight have suggested that large numbers of genes combine to determine a persons weight.The next step is to carry out what scientists call a meta-analysis which will involve pooling data from other other data banks, including the UK Biobank that holds genetic information on half a million Brits, to seethey get the same results.Prof Penninger said: You learn a lot from biobanks. But, like everything, it is not the ultimate answer to le.But they are the starting points and very good points for confirmation, very important links and associations to human health.The team says that its work is unique.

This vital funding has helped hundreds of key projects continue to offer support to people in our communities.  One of those to benefit is Northern Ireland’s Macular Society, which helps people struggling with their sight due to macular degeneration. They provide peer support, counselling, help, advice and many other services to members. The charity received an additional £, grant from The National Lottery to adapt and increase support for people remotely during lockdown. Elaine Orwinhas been involved with the charity for  years. The -year-old said: Macular disease affects your physical health. You often can’t drive so lose your independence, but our group of  members is a leline. We used to meet monthly, but since lockdown it’s fortnightly virtual meetings, and I’ve also referred people for phone counselling. The contact we have had is really precious.  The charity is planning to launch a befriending service and webinars, and they’ve also run a Tech Talk project, helping members to use computers and even just access audio description on their TVs. It’s really important for us to thank National Lottery players, as without them none of this would be possible.

Chris Murphy , , who lives alone, says the charity has kept him in touch with friends during this dficult time. He explained: The centre has been bringing me a food parcel every week. They stop for a chat when it’s delivered and phone to check I’m okay. I love working in my garden so they’ve sent me bits for that, and there’s also been activity packs and books I’ve borrowed from them. It’s all keeping me busy!

The -year-old said: I’ve been going to events including bingo at Twyn Community Hub since moving here nearly six years ago, and throughout lockdown staff and volunteers have been popping round most days to deliver food, and have a chat. I’m lucky in that I phone friends and family, but other older people in the area would see no one otherwise. The meals and food they provide are fabulous. Being able to take away the worry about small, practical, everyday things is so important. Thanks to people playing The National Lottery that is happening right here in our local area.

And I think some politicians would have loved to have reacted earlier but in their political opinion it probably wasnapost feasible because people wouldnapost have perhaps responded in the way they eventually did. Sir Ian also said that he believes the statement we are guided by the science is slightly misleading. He explained: I donapost think ministers intend it to be misleading. I think they intend it to help to provide trust in what they are saying. And quite rightly so. Basically what we in the scientic community do is give the best advice we can based on the evidence thataposs available to us. We then pass it to government ministers and the policy parts of government who can then take that and do with it what they like within the policy context.

The new plan, due to take effect from June , will see people asked to stay indoors for  daystheyaposve been identied as having been in close contact with someone who is infected. But itaposs unclearthe self-isolation will be enforced, as Health Secretary Matt Hancock appealed to Britons to do their bit to help prevent a second peak of the virus as lockdown measures are eased. Writing for the Evening Standard, Mr Hancock said: Everyone will have a part to play. Not just hygiene and social distancing, but getting a testyou have symptoms and under the new system, self-isolatingyouaposve been in close contact with someone who tests positive. That way, under test and trace, people who have been in contact with a positive case and are at higher risk can isolate, and we can ease more measures on everyone . The governmentaposs first attempt at testing and contact tracing was stopped in mid-March due to the sheer scale of cases in the UK, a senior Public Health England  official said today.Professor Yvonne Doyle, PHEaposs medical director, told the Commons Science and Technology Committee that many hundreds of thousands of people had been exposed to coronavirus by the time testing and tracing was stopped around March .The Governmentaposs testing coordinator Professor John Newton, who is also PHEaposs director of health improvement, said the testing plans were abandoned after a million cases of Covid- were predicted across the UK. Their comments contrast with those from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has defended leaving care home guidance in place until March  that said the risk of infection across care homes was low. On Tuesday, Mr Hancock told the Commons that community transmission of coronavirus in the UK in early to mid-March was low. Prof Doyle told MPs the policy decision was to very much focus on the NHS in terms of testing and that, given the testing resources available, a decision was taken to stop more widespread community testing and tracing. She said it was stopped in March because of the sheer scale of cases in the UK, which had been introduced by multiple introductions, particularly after half-term, and from European countries we now know had large amounts of prevalence themselves. She added: So we have multiple introductions, with many hundreds of thousands of people by March who had now been exposed to this virus in this country. Contact tracing could not possibly have had the capacity to address that. And with the capacity of lab testing and our contact tracers, we felt the most important thing to do was to focus on where there was national concern, which was the capacity of the NHS, to accrue that testing. Prof Doyle told MPs the organisation did not reject the South Korean model of mass coronavirus testing, and had in fact followed a similar path until March. We did not reject the South Korean model, in fact we were very interested in what was happening internationally from the get-go. The testing capacity and testing profile of PHEaposs approach in the contain phase - which is between January and March - was very close to the one of South Korea for quite a long time, into early March.  Prof Newton said there had been a discussion in the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswhich established that it would not be worthwhile to continue contact tracing once community transmission took hold in the UK. He said the decision in March to abandon it was made by Government informed by all its advisers, not just PHE. When in March it became apparent that community transmission was occurring and we had multiple injections, introductions from dferent countries in the UK, that decision was then enacted, Prof Newton told MPs. It was a decision of course of Government, informed by all its advisers, not just Public Health England. He added: The epidemiology was crucial, we had an increase in the number of cases in March. The advice from modellers was that within a short period we would expect to be having a million cases in the UK, and of courseyou have a million cases thereaposs no way, however much contact tracing or testing capacity you have, that you can pursue the South Korea model. At that point, the Government made the decision to move to lockdown as the most appropriate response to the epidemiology in the UK at the time. Downing Street said the decision to move away from contact tracing in mid-March was taken by the Governmentaposs experts. Askedit was a decision by ministers, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: It was set out at the time by the Government experts who were attending the daily press conference why they had reached the decision to start focusing their testing on people who were sick in hospital. Thataposs how I remember the decision making process.

He wrote: “The absence again of any secondary guidance on what is expected regarding Years  and  ‘face-to-face’ experience was discussed by our Executive Committee today. “Further discussion with the Department for Education this afternoon leads us to advise you to rule out any students in those year groups ing immediately after half-term.” In a video message to accompany the email, Mr Barton said: “We shouldn’t be rushing into anything at all, and therefore we shouldn’t be expecting that we are going to have year  and year  pupils in. “And in fact, I don’t think the Department [for Education] are expecting that you would have those pupils into school from June .” In his email, he added: “Bear in mind that this is an issue of public health – wanting to ensure that groups of students are not mixing widely in the community. “Great caution is therefore necessary, and we would recommend waiting until after half-term to see what the government has finally proposed, and then we will respond. “There’s some feeling that theby any but a small handful of secondary students may now look unlikely during the summer term. He urged heads to proceed with caution and feel under no pressure for June  to be anything other than one where a partial and controlled wider opening may start to happen. He went on to say a rota system - where small numbers of pupilsfor a day or week at a time - will continue to apply from September onwards. He added: Business as usual for our schools and colleges is a long way off.

And nothing sums up the way it’s been for centuries than Prince Charles leading the appeal because he needs serfs to work his estates or his profits will wither. When Charles helped launch the Pick For Britain campaign his Clarence House website described him as “a farmer himself”. Of course he is. Just as Mike Ashley is a “Sports Direct toilet cleaner himself”. The toughest thing he has to pick every morning is which one of the three boiled eggs, cooked to dferent consistencies, he wants for breakfast. Charles warns that working the fields is “hard graft” and “pickers need to be stickers”, despite him never grafting yet sticking millions in his pocket every year from his Duchy of Cornwall estate. Why didn’t he look closer to home and recruit the son who’s moping in Calornia, or brother Edward, who last grafted for five minutes in the Marines  years ago, before crying off.Or Andrew, who has surely risen many times at the crack of dawn to grab the odd juicy pear.

Doctors were unable to explain why the teenager had developed killer bacterial sepsis - as he had no underlying health conditions. The youngster, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said he felt like he had his “soul drained out” after going through eight gruelling days in hospital. His distraught mum Andrea, , prepared for the worst. But George bravely fought off the virus and toxic sepsis, and has now been discharged to continue his recovery at his home. “I felt like I had my soul drained out of me, it was agonising at times because I just couldn’t get up, the teen said. “My head was pounding like hammers. It was one of the worst feelings I’ve ever experienced. “On the fth day I didn’t even know what was happening anymore, it was terrying.  “I was just confused - it was a hellish nightmare. “The NHS staff are the best thing to happen to me in my le, it could have been a dferent story, but they saved me. “I feel like people aren’t taking it seriously, and we should be. “People need to understand that this can happen to anyone.” Andrea admitted her son’s outlook was “bleak” after seeing poor George’s health deteriorate so rapidly. . From Monday Unlimited exercise allowed. Employees to be encouraged toto workplaces that have stayed open through- out the lockdownsafe. Garden centres could reopen while there may be more guidance on the use of outdoor spaces including open-air markets, high streets and cemeteries. . End of May Start of June Phasedof primary schools in England, starting with Year . Households could be allowed to expand “social bubble” to meet one other household of family or friends. . JunePhasedof secondary schools in England before the summer holidays. Small team sports such as five-a-side football could be allowed, along with outdoor gatherings of fewer than  people. Cafes with outdoor seating could reopen while outdoor sports like golf, tennis and angling might resume. Possibleof Premier League matches, although behind closed doors. . End of August Start of September Pubs, bars and restaurants could gradually reopen although customers would be expected to follow strict social distancing rules. . October Possibleof football fans to matches. Gyms could be allowed to re-open. But any further lting of restrictions to get back to normal le would be in doubt amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus or an outbreak of seasonal flu. The mum said: “His outlook was bleak, the hospital staff were amazing but I thought I might not take this boy home. “It was the most horrying experience for a mum to go through. “I still hear the machines beeping every night. “It’s been a nightmare - you never expect this to happen to you. “Those eight days felt like a letime of pain. I really thought I might lose my boy. “When Covid started everyone said it would only affect old or vulnerable people - but we’re learning this isn’t true. “Anyone can die from it, it doesn’t discriminate.”  She added: “My son’s body shut down because it was trying to fight off this virus, he wouldn’t have gone through all of that hell without Covid.” George had told his mum on May  he felt unwell and she treated his fever with a couple paracetamol. The following day, his fever continued to soar from .°C to .°C - and he was suddenly unable to eat or walk. Andrea called , who advised her to bring him to Barnsley General Hospital.After a second test, she was told George had contracted Covid- but that his blood pressure was dangerously low.An X-ray revealed a fog on his chest and as his condition escalated, George was rushed to Leeds General Infirmary so that he could be seen by a team of cardiologists.  The married mum-of-three continued: He told me he was unwell and after taking his temperature I gave him some paracetamol. He was still able to walk on Monday, but by Tuesday he was lethargic and unable to walk or eat. I called  and they told me to get him to the hospital and that’s when they told us he had Coronavirus but his blood pressure was dangerously low. His heart and lungs weren’t working properly. They said he had toxic shock sepsis. They transferred him to the resuscitation ward because of his heart. They said it could stop any second. We weren’t allowed to follow him to Leeds, and I had to watch my scared -year-old son leave on his own. It was stressful, and frightening, and impossible to describe. Thankfully, after managing to pump Georgeaposs body full of antibiotics, he began to show signs of recovery and he was able tohome to his family last Wednesday. George has been slowly regaining his health at home, but doctors are still confused as to why his body suddenly shut down. They have scheduled consultations with cardiologists and rheumatologists who will be discussing his condition on Friday to try to understand more.

Researchers used statistics to put together a model which they say shows that the death toll would be around the , mark - which is similar to Germany. They also claim not only the lockdown could have been shorter but it would have caused less damage to the economy. The model has been drawn up by British scientist James Annan from Blue Skies Research.He wrote in a blog : Implementing the lockdown one week earlier would have saved about , lives in the current wave . It would also have made for a shorter, cheaper, less damaging lockdown in economic terms. And this is all quite simple maths that every single modeller involved in SAGE was fully aware of at the time. His claims that an earlier lockdown would have saved lives has been backed by other researchers. Dr Kit Yates, senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of Bath, told the : In the early stages of an epidemic, the number of cases is growing exponentially. ‘It is clear that, had we locked down sooner, we would have reduced the spread earlier, limiting the number of cases and consequently the number of deaths.  The other benefit of locking down earlier would have been bringing cases under control sooner and potentially allowing the release of lockdown sooner. As of Friday , people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus. Critics of Mr Annanaposs analogy say other factors may have contributed to the death such as the public not following early advice to stay at home before a stricter lockdown was introduced.The news comes as the Prime Minister set a -day target to deliver a coronavirus test and trace system so the lockdown can be further eased across the country. Mr Johnson said the government has recruited a ,-strong army of trackers to identy the contacts of infected victims and prevent further outbreaks of the killer bug. The Governmentaposs scientic advisers had warned scheme must be up and running before restrictions could be lted - including bringing back Englandaposs primary schools.

Troy House in Monmouth originates from the th century and the Grade II listed four storey dream home comes complete with a theatre, chapel and two tennis courts. It was built for the family of the Duke of Beaufort, adding to an imposing portfolio of properties which also included Great Castle House in Monmouth and Badminton House in Gloucestershire.The estate was later converted into a convent school and then became a school, but as the condition of the buildings deteriorated the school moved locations in the s and the once grand manor has been left to rot. The , square-foot property has now been put up for auction, with a guide price of between £, and £, - but a look inside at just how dilapidated it has become suggests youaposll need far deeper pockets toit to its former glory. Listed by Allsop, it provides  bedrooms, four dormitories, a principalaposs flat, a staff flat, a caretakeraposs flat, a two storey hostel block, outbuildings and garages. The picturesque setting and grand exterior belie the true scale of the renovation job required, with photos of the interior showing floorboards and structures rotten through, with a huge clearance job needed to clear the abandoned school furniture. The description reads: The property is presented in a poor state of repair and requires extensive works of modernisation and refurbishment. The property may afford possible potential for redevelopment and or a number of alternative uses, subject to obtaining all necessary consents.If youaposre able to look beyond the current state of repair, the ultimate do-er upper does come with some incredible benefits, including sprawling land, original fittings and an estate that wouldnapost look out of place on Downton Abbey. Itaposs located a short journey from the historic market town of Monmouth, with both Cardf and Bristol city centres also accessible.  With the Brecon Beacons National Park to the west and River Wye is to the east, you wonapost be short of idyllic viewsyou want a bit of a break from the DIY. Richard Adamson, partner and auctioneer at Allsop, said: Troy House has received a signicant amount of interest with over  enquiries regarding the property, in just over a week of coming to the market. We have seen a mixed-bag of interest from people who could use the property for multiple uses including as a private home, converting into a boutique hotel and spa, or refurbished into luxury apartments, subject to planning.

Sharon McIlvaney claims her ex-bestie took revenge as she wouldnapost let him join a Facebook group chat for mums.She says she was sickened when a fake Facebook profile masquerading as her declared she had tested positive for covid- and anyone who had attended her BBQ needed to get themselves tested. But things took an even darker turn when someone she had considered a good friend for more than a decade posted: RIP Sharon McIlvaney, you will be sadly missed. Taken too soon from this dreadful disease. When Sharonaposs daughter Ebony Smith confronted the person spreading news of her demise, the family say they were horried to be told it was all because he was annoyed they had refused to let the man into a Facebook group chat. Heartbroken Sharon branded her ex-pal apospoisonapos for his vile plot and reported him to South Yorkshire Police, before setting about informing terried friends and family that she was alive and did not have the virus. Sharon, from Rossington, South Yorkshire, said: I was left in tears about it all. I cried down the phone to him. I wanted to know why he would go to those s. Heaposs poison. I might have been too soft on him up until now. He was asking me how I was during lockdown and I said I was keeping up fine because of a group chat I had with other mums.  He then askedhe could join it and I said no. He isnapost a mum so it has nothing to do with him. He felt left out but Iaposm a mum just trying to deal with everyday le and make sure my kids are ok. My world doesnapost revolve around one so-called aposfriendapos. Sharon had enjoyed a BBQ with her children in their garden earlier this month and thought nothing of sharing what she had done on social media. However she claims her former friend created a  Facebook account using her name and picture to post a warning about the BBQ to others. He wrote: Just to let all my friends and family know I have been tested positive for covid-. For all the ones who have been visiting my house lately especially the BBQ we had the other day, you might have to get yourself checked out now. [I] am really sorry. Just hours later, the man then put a post on his own Facebook informing everyone Sharon had died.  He wrote: RIP Sharon McIlvaney, you will be sadly missed. Taken too soon from this dreadful disease. Those who knew Sharon reacted with horror before she was able to set the record straight that she was still alive and well. Sharonaposs daughter Ebony Smith confronted the person and was met with an unrepentant reply. In response, the former friend said: If Shaz had me as a friend on Facebook group chat and treated me as a proper friend we wouldnapost be in this mess. When pressed further about making a fake Facebook page he wrote: I guess she has learnt a valuable lesson to value her friends and donapost take them for a ride. Sharon said: It was my first birthday in isolation and I didnapost want to take the kids out because my son is classied as high risk. So, just me and the kids did a BBQ and sat in the garden. Nobody  came around apart from my mum to drop off a card and some essentials. The kids are my world so I will do anything to protect them. He would have known all of this about my son because up until the middle of , I classed him as a [good] friend. When I was with my previous long term partner, he would say he felt left out. Itaposs like heaposs never grown up. He will send a message and then moan and cryI donapost reply straight away. It wouldnapost matterI was making tea or bathing the kids. Friends were quick to rally around the mum after the ordeal. Lindsey Richardson said: How goddamn sick and childish. aposOoohh you wont be my friend so Iaposm going to tell tales on the playgroundapos. Sam Doc said: I accepted that friend request [from the fake account].... what an actual weirdo would post something like that for revenge without thinking of how your friends and family might feel !

The unidentied infant, known only as Baby S, was found by a member of staff at the facility in Needham Market in Suffolk on May . Officers believe the newborn was less than  hours old at the time of the horrying discovery. It is still not clear how she died. Police have appealed for the little girlaposs aposfrightenedapos mother to come forward, stating they are concerned for her well-being. Rebecca Rawlings, assistant principal coroneraposs officer, read from a report prepared by Temporary Detective Chief Inspector Karl Nightingale of Suffolk Police. She told Fridayaposs inquest hearing in Ipswich that police were called to Sackers, a waste recycling centre in Ipswich Road, Needham Market, shortly after pm on May . One of the staff members had discovered what appeared to be a deceased baby, she said. Police officers and paramedics attended. The presence of a deceased baby was confirmed, with death being recognised at .pm that day. Baby S is a girl, her date of birth remains unknown but her appearance is that of a newborn. No further details are known regarding the identity of her or her family. Ms Rawlings said that police have appealed for information that may help the investigation and their appeal continues. A post-mortem examination gave her provisional medical cause of death as undetermined, with further tests required.  It is anticipated these will take some time, she said. The police investigation is ongoing, Ms Rawlings said, and Sackers has provided full support and co-operation with all inquiries. Suffolkaposs senior coroner Nigel Parsley opened and adjourned the inquest to a date to be confirmed to allow for further investigations to continue. Detective Chief Superintendent Eamonn Bridger said, while appealing for information, that police reasonably suspect that the baby was less than  hours old.

However, thanks to a  a close Vladimir Putin political ally - Nadia will not not lose her job over the raunchy outfit Although she said the “glory” of her new-found fame was “hard to endure”, she told her local newspaper Tulskaya Pressa. Nadia had earlier explained to her managers she was “too hot” in her protective gown and clothes but doctors in Tula Regional Clinical Hospital have now revealed there were shortages of both disposable and reusable medical clothing to wear over her lingerie. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here The nurse told the newspaper she had to close all her social media over the furore which led regional health chiefs to announce she was being disciplined for “non-compliance with the requirements for medical clothing”. This came after she had been forced to stay apart from her family for two months while she cares for coronavirus patients, so as not to put her relatives at risk, she said. “Iaposm not scared - itaposs my job,” she was quoted as saying. “I always wanted to help people, bring benefits, so I went into medicine.” The head of her hospital Dr Anna Savishcheva insisted Nadia had not been punished over the pictures. And she revealed the nurse had received a personal visit and backing from Tula regional governor Alexey Dyumin, , a former Putin bodyguard and military spy chief who has been tipped as a future Russian president.  We did not impose any disciplinary sanctions, in any case, written,” Dr Savishcheva told Vesti Tula TV. “The girl continues to work. “This is a good employee, a professional, who provides medical care at a high level.” She said: “As soon as her picture appeared in web, governor Alexey Dyumin met her - and was in touch with her. “He chatted, supported and thanked her and all the medics for their work. Nadia did not deserve reproach for her appearance, said the hospital chief. The nurse did her job, she did not pose.” Nadia is believed to be not the only medic to wear only underwear beneath their transparent protective gowns.  We just have nothing to wear,” a doctor told Komsomolskaya Pravda. “There are not enough scrub suits, which according to the rules we should wear under our protective gowns…. Believe me, we wouldn’t go nakedwe were provided with a complete set.” A doctor on the same ward as Nadia said: I totally support the nurse. “It very hot in these costumes for a long time. “She did not deserve any punishment. “Most likely she realised that the costume was transparent, but decided to dress like this anyway because it is very hard to be in these costumes for a long time.

Baby Emily, now seven months, was born safe and well in October weighing a healthy lbs oz.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email. Lyndsey, from Telford, Shropshire, said: The bracelet saved my babyaposs le. I definitely credit it for ensuring she made it safely in the world because I was worried something was going to go wrong. It gave me the confidence to go to the doctors with my concerns because I had proof from the bracelet and could tell them exactly how many times sheaposd moved. It was great having that reassurance and to know I wasnapost wasting the doctorsapos time.  Itaposs incredible that something as simple as a bracelet could do all that. Primary school teacher Lyndsey, who is also mum to six-year-old Chloe Thompson, had previously used a phone app to track movements but found the bracelet more practical as she was able to wear it and easily log on the go. Lyndsey, married to -year-old engineer Christopher Thompson, used a prototype of the Aska Maternity Movement Bracelet. The bracelet features a small loop and charm that the wearer slips across each bead on the bracelet every time the baby moves. Lyndsey said: When I was pregnant with my first I tried a phone app to track movements but obviously you canapost have a phone at school. I was so busy even at lunchtime and by the time I got to the end of the day I wouldnapost be able to remember what movements Iaposve had. At my -week scan my midwe offered me a bracelet that was being used in trials as Iaposd mentioned reduced movement in my first pregnancy. Having the bracelet reassured me that Iaposd had a certain number of movements.  The bracelet helpedI felt movement while I was teaching, I might be sat with a group of children and could just put my hand on the bracelet and move it across. I would also show the children the bracelet and involve them too, which was nice. Lyndsey had already faced numerous complications in the pregnancy including respiratory problems due to her severe asthma and having to be put on antibiotics throughout after catching sickness bugs. But when Lyndsey said she noticed Emilyaposs movements started to slow down at  weeks, concerned doctors took growth scans every few weeks to monitor her progress.  NHS guidance states thatmums-to-be notice their baby is moving less than usual, or thereaposs a change in the pattern of movements, it may be the first sign their baby is unwell. The NHS also urges mums-to-be to contact a midwe or local maternity unit immediatelythe babyaposs movements have slowed down so their wellbeing can be assessed. Lyndsey said: As the weeks went on, past the -week point, I felt the movements were getting less and less. After having a growth scan they said she was slightly on the low side and to monitor them as time passed.When Lyndsey noticed she wasnapost moving the bracelet charm as often due to reduced movement a week before her due date, she decided to go to hospital. Princess Royal Hospital in Telford. Doctors at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford examined Lyndsey, monitored the babyaposs heart and decided to induce her due to the numerous issues sheaposd faced in the pregnancy. Lyndsey said: I would normally have between six and eight movements a day, when I was only having three and it was later in the day I decided to get it checked out. Directly off the back of me saying she hasnapost moved as much as she should have done they put the bands round and monitored her heart rate.

After a while he realised the teacher had been referring to his daughter, whose name is Keeley, pronounced aposkee-leeapos. When school finished, his child admitted it had been happening all year and attempts to tell the teacher how it should be pronounced were ignored. The dad sent an email explaining the misunderstanding as his daughter would be in the teacheraposs class for many years, but got no response. He asked his daughter to log on to class early and tell her teacher politely it was Keeley like really, not Kelly like jelly as people often get confused. Class started shortly afterwards and almost immediately the girl was again referred to as Kelly, so the dad went over to the screen and said: “Hi, this is Keeley’s Dad. Her name is not Kelly.

Rumours have been circulating about the dictatoraposs health after he reportedly underwent heart surgery earlier this year. Speculation reached a fever pitch after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il-sung on April . One report even suggested he was in a vegetative state following the operation. Some have suggested Kim was absent for a period of post-plastic surgery rehab. Since then he has made limited appearances with many speculating that a body double could be taking his place. Kim was already said to be in general poor health condition, being a heavy smoker and morbidly obese - which makes him more susceptible to major health issues.Rodman was asked about Kimaposs health while promoting the new Netflix documentary The Last dance about the Chicago Bulls quest for their sixth NBA title in .Appearing on Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan grilled Dennis about his friendship with Kim.When asked about Kim Dennis replied: I do have communications with North Korea, but I can say this though –you see his sister on TV, running the country, now you know something is wrong, that’s all I’m going give you. It is thought Kimaposs sister, Kim Yo-jong, will be his successor in the event of his death. She has ascended through the ranks of the communist Workersapos Party of Korea and stepped in for her brother once before due to ill health in October , providing a close supporting role ever since. Speaking to the New York Post about her, Dennis added: His sister was a sweetheart.  “She was very kind to me when [I was a] guest.” Dennis, , told the US paper earlier this month that he believed that Kim was still alive, saying his rumored health ordeal “probably wasn’t much.

The trial was carried out in  healthy adults between ages  and  and demonstrated promising results after  days— with the final results due to be evaluated in six months. New research published in medical journal The Lancet hails the finding as an important milestone. The trial demonstrates that a single dose of the new adenovirus type  vectored COVID-vaccine produces virus-specic antibodies and T cells in  days, making it a potential candidate for further investigation, Professor Wei Chen from the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology said. “These results represent an important milestone. “The challenges in the development of a COVD- vaccine are unprecedented, and the ability to trigger these immune responses does not necessarily indicate that the vaccine will protect humans from COVID-.  This result shows a promising vision for the development of COVID- vaccines, but we are still a long way from this vaccine being available to all.” Further trials are needed to tell whether the immune response it triggers can effectively protect against SARS-CoV- infection, but the signs are promising.

You never know, we may even have cup draws coming soon!I must say, however, I feel the SPFL’s stated aim of kicking off the new campaign at that time –August  for league football – is hopeful rather than one they expect to pull off. There is a whole lot of work to be done to prove to the government football matches can be staged safely.Now, the Premiership clubs have given themselves some space to think about how to restart football with a new campaign.It’s the only sensible option.Clubs now know what ision they are going to be in and there can be some tentative plans put in place to move forward.That’s a step in the right direction.Dundee now know they’ll have to fend off Heartsthey want to win the Championship and can budget for the year ahead knowing who they will be playing.Whether there are fans in attendance, we’ll have to wait and see.The good thing is, it feels like our game is finally moving forward.The past couple of weeks have seen both Dundee and Dundee United start to reshape their squads for next season.Neither are yet in a position to start signing new players, of course, but there are some hints of what is to come at both clubs.United released a few boys at the end of their contracts – Paul Watson, Rakish Bingham and Osman Sow among them.It’s not a clearout or anything but I think we should expect a number of new faces at Tannadice once some sort of normality reappears.With Watson going, they evidently have a new centre-back in mind.I’d expect them to strengthen the spine of the team, adding a central midfielder and a striker to compete with Lawrence Shankland and Nicky Clark.At Dundee, I only expect a handful of new faces.A striker to partner Kane Hemmings is a certainty while maybe another wide attacker and central midfielder will arrive.What happens with Christophe Berra we will have to wait and see. Hearts might not be too happy with Dundee right now#IT was refreshing to see a bit of live football on the TV over the weekend with the Bundesliga kicking off again.It might not have been what we are used to with no fans, masked subs and someDortmund#s Erling Haaland showing a pandemic still can’t stop him.Germany is leading the way on how to get the game back – problem is I don’t see any other country being able to do it as safely as the Germans.I’M no basketball fan but watching the Last Dance on Netflix certainly made me think about becoming one!Remarkable series on the s Chicago Bulls and the great Michael Jordan.Get it watched!SPFL call   Premiership season with Celtic crowned champions, Hearts relegated and St Johnstone landing top-six finish\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp spfl-premiership-celtic-hearts-st-johnstone embed # secretjwBrECgV\" data-secret\"jwBrECgV\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.50056314-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.50056314-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.50056314-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.50056314-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"mobile coronavirus testing units coming to arbroath","story":"A mobile coronavirus testing unit will be visiting Arbroath early next month.Testing for Covid- is now available to anyone over the age of five who is showing symptoms of the virus, including a high temperature, new or continuous cough, and the loss of taste or smell.Testing at the mobile unit, which will be located at Arbroath High School from Monday,  June to Friday, June , can be booked online and a limited number of home testing kits will also be available.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “This further expansion of testing will ensure that anyone with symptoms will be able to find outthey have Covid-, and will therefore be able to know whether or not they should be isolating.“As well as allowing more people to have a case of Covid- confirmed, expansion will also be helpful as we build towards our strategy of test, trace, isolate and support – something that will be especially important as we start to emerge gradually from lockdown.“This is vital in order to keep transmission in communities low.”From Saturday, May  until Sunday, May  there will be a mobile testing unit at Michelin Athletic Club in Dundee.A unit will alsoto Michelin Athletic Club from Saturday, June  until Sunday, June .These mobile units are on top of the testing site at Perth College UHI, and key NHS and social care workers, as well as symptomatic household members of these workers, are still asked to access testing through the NHS.The tests can be booked online at www.nhs.uk conditions coronavirus-covid-For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53844381-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53844381-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53844381-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53844381-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"rakish bingham dundee united release","story":"Rakish Bingham has spoken of his #surprise# over his Dundee United departure but vowed to bounce back.Bingham had impressed after joining the Tangerines on a short-term deal back in February as he chased of a longer contract to fulfil his dream of starring in the Premiership next season.Yet the -year-old former Wigan, Falkirk and Doncaster winger had his hopes dashed when he was recently released by the newly-promoted Premiership outfit as they prepare for their much-anticipatedto the top-flight.Bingham said: #I was a bit surprised to be honest.#I thought I#d done quite well and the feeling I had wasn#t that I was going to be let go.#I can#t speak for the club with everything that#s going on in terms of budget, and that#s obviously part of the reason this has happened.#But I just have to take it on the chin and see what#s out there for the next step in my career.#Bingham savoured his time on Tayside with Robbie Neilson#s men and hopes they can hold their own in the top tier of Scottish Football next season.He added: #It was good at United.

, The friendly competition, organised by the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board , was launched in a bid to encourage more people to eat steak at home after restaurants across the country were forced due to shut due to Covid-.Karl Pendlebury, AHDB’s senior manager for Quality Schemes, said: “In these dficult times it’s good to have goals and these two chefs kindly stepped up to have a bit of fun and give support to farmers and meat industry.#Before the lockdown steak was often a treat when out with family or friends and these guys have shown us that cooking a mouth-watering steak at home can be worth a shot.”Karl added: “With the hospitality industry, pubs and restaurants closed because of coronavirus incredible deals on meat to treat the family are on offer for shoppers whether on the high street or in big retailers.#The event is part of a £. million campaign to encourage people across Britain to create restaurant-style meals in their own homes using hindquarter cuts including the short loin, sirloin, rump.It comes as the number expensive cuts being sold to restaurants dropped due to the Covid- lockdown, with consumers instead causing a surge in demand for beef mince at supermarkets.This has resulted in more expensive cuts being used to create lower priced mince in a bid to keep up with supply.Quality Meats Scotland chief executive Alan Clarke said: #This is a unique joint effort by AHDB, QMS and HCC which we hope will drive an uptake in steak and roasting joint sales in the run up to barbecue season.#It’s a fantastic opportunity for everyone to get involved and create some amazing dishes in their own kitchens.”The campaign is being funded from the £. million fund of AHDB red meat levies ring-fenced for collaborative projects which is managed by

That would eventually be confirmed as their final league position when the SPFL board ended the term earlier this week.It was enough to secure European qualication for a seventh consecutive season.However, the Dons were denied the chance to leapfrog Motherwell into third on March , the day of the shutdown, when their clash at Fir Park was cancelled due to the pandemic.McGinn said: “I felt that we were going to push on and go on a bit of a run.“That’s why we were looking forward to that Motherwell game so much.“We went down there earlier in the season and put in a strong performance and came away with a victory .“I just felt that the team – with everyone coming back from injuries – was looking strong.“We were feeling confident after the last game .“It feels like a letime ago that we were playing Hibs.

There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings. They had a good day and brought the car home in th overall and eighth in a competitive Class . They plan to do the full season, so watch this space for updates on their progress.The closely contested event was finally won by Michael Binnie and Clare Mole in a Mitsubishi Evo, with the ever present Jock Armstrong and Cameron Fair taking second place in the TEG Sport Impreza, after leading the rally for much of the day. Freddie Milne and Patrick Walsh in the Fiesta R were third overall.Next up is the Speyside Rally in Elgin on April ."},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre has its finger on the pulse","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Soccer Centre volunteers have received vital first aid training.Sports clubs are required to ensure a number of their volunteers have a valid first aid certicate and when Lochgilphead Soccer Centre looked to secure the services of an accredited firm to provide the required two-day course, outdoor and first aid coach Andy Craven was happy to help.Covering theory and practice of all fundamental aspects of first aid, the volunteers were grateful to Andy for his informative and interactive approach to learning important skills and knowledge to safeguard the welfare of players and spectators.Soccer Centre chairman Stuart Green  said: #It is not just about having the relevant certicate, but ensuring a good number of our volunteers have the knowledge, skills and equipment to look after our youngsters and their friends and families.#Knocks and sprains are common in football and we deal with them every week, however, even as volunteers, we have an obligation to be prepared with any eventuality and Andy was first class in guiding our volunteers through a range of scenarios.#Andy said: #Whilst first aid is a serious business, the folks at Lochgilphed Soccer Centre were a great bunch. They were keen to learn and kept me on my toes with a range of questions.#I am a qualied outdoor and first aid instructor and have been working with community and sports groups throughout Argyll and Bute and their enthusiasm and desire to develop skills to look after members of their community in the event of something going wrong never ceases to impress me.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

inAugust.The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done in a way that will not disrupt efforts to control the virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following Ms Sturgeons announcement in parliament, the Scottish Government published its strategic framework for the re-opening of schools.Here, well detailwhat parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.When will schools re-open Schools in Scotland are set to re-open on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools - but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid contact from dferent classesTeachers, rather than pupils, will move around classrooms where possibleThere will be enhanced hygiene practices across all schools, including additional cleaning,params: .pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in

to explain how it is safe for children and staff toto schools in England next month following its publication of scientic evidence.One union leader accused Boris Johnson of taking a ldquocavalier attitude towards children, while another union called evidence from the Governmentrsquos scientic advisers ldquoinconclusive.The remarks come after the Government published documents from the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieson Friday.Sage looked at the scientic modelling for seven dferent scenarios for school closures, the papers show, but none of the published scenarios looked at the Governmentrsquos plan to reopen schools in England to children in Reception, Year  and Year  from June .One of the documents says the evidence on how likely children are to transmit Covid- remains ldquoinconclusive ndash but the balance of evidence suggests that it may be lower than in adults.Teachers do not appear to be at above average risk compared with other occupations, scientic advisers have suggested, although there is still a chance they can transmit Covid-.The publication of the Sage papers ndash used to inform proposals to reopen schools in England ndash comes after unions, council leaders and MPs demanded to see the scientic evidence underpinning the decision.But following their publication, the school leadersrsquo union NAHT has written to the Education Secretary urging the Government to explain why reopening next month is a ldquowise thing to do.Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union , said: ldquoWe are surprised that the wider opening of schools proposed by Boris Johnson has not been modelled by Sage.ldquoThis points to a cavalier attitude towards the nationrsquos children. The fact of the matter is that Sage has only weak evidence as to what extent children can transmit the virus to others.Dr Bousted added: ldquoIt remains the case that the National Education Union does not yet think it safe for the wider opening of schools.vw,vw,px, px\"The children of key workers comply with social distancing rules while attending a hub school in Edinburgh Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, added: ldquoThe evidence presented by Sage in terms of justying the decision by Government to start to reopen schools from June  is inconclusive.He added that the Sage papers will ldquoonly add to teachersrsquo uncertainty and anxiety.ldquoThe NASUWT remains of the view that no school should reopen until it can be demonstrated that it is safe to do so, Dr Roach said.It comes after a survey from Unison suggests only % of school support staff felt reassured by the Governmentrsquos recent messaging that schools in England will be safe to reopen from next month.Wider contextual issues ndash including whether families have black, Asian and minority ethnicmembers ndash should be taken into account when assessing the impact of relaxing school closures on transmission, the advice from Sage suggests.It adds that having dferent groups of children attend on alternate weeks may be a good way to ldquostop extensive transmission chains in schools.The documents from Sage suggest that younger teachersrsquo attendance in schools could be prioritised in order to decrease the likelihood of infection for school staff in more vulnerable groups.But reporters were told during a briefing that Office for National Statisticsdata suggests teachers are not at an ldquounusual increase in risk of transmission among than in other professions.Sources involved said the risk of pupils going back to school and becoming seriously ill with Covid- was ldquovery, very, very small but itrsquos ldquonot zero.They said: ldquoThat remains true for every activity outside the house where you might come into contact with people. So itrsquos totally impossible to say that any change has no risk at all.It comes as a separate scientic review of global studies, led by University College London , has suggested that children and young people could be half as likely to catch coronavirus than adults.Researchers found those aged under  had % lower odds of catching Sars-CoV-, the official name of the coronavirus which causes the disease Covid-, from an infected person.With just  days to go until schools could reopen more widely, ministers have come under pressure to reconsider their plans to send more children back to primary school next month.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, said: ldquoSupport for a fixed date for schoolis vanishing quickly. What is needed now is local flexibility to determine when it is right for schools to open up to more pupils, informed by evidence of what is happening in their own local area.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ldquoIt will quickly become clear to anybody reading the papers that the science is not definitive.He added: ldquoThe Government must be able to show very clearly that its five tests have been met before it gives the green light to any wider opening from June , and it must then be flexible about the timescale and approaches needed to bring in eligible pupils.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ldquoThe papers published by Sage today show that the phased, cautiousof a limited number of pupils to classrooms has been a carefully considered decision based on the best scientic and medical advice.ldquoMy department continues to engage with the school, college and nursery sectors and I am enormously grateful for all the planning and preparation they are doing, alongside local authorities and academy trusts.ldquoThe welfare of children remains at the very heart of everything we are doing because being able to be back in school will benefit not just their education but also their wellbeing..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Unions criticise  uinconclusive u scientic evidence behind school reopening plan"},{"url":null,"title":"party-people-borders-invited-zoom-disco","story":"BORDERERS desperate for a party after spending weeks in lockdown are being invited to throw on their gladrags and dancing shoes ndash and hit the living room for a night in.Mental health campaigner Emma Smith, of Peebles, is organising a virtual disco through Zoom.She said: ldquoI wanted to offer something that people could do from the comfort of their own homes, bringing the community together and giving them a welcome distraction from everything thatrsquos going on right now.Emma already has two successful charity events under her belt, having arranged for local singer-songwriter Tommy Ashby to headline gigs.

that self-isolation periods of two weeks will be imposed on new arrivals to the UK from June , with fines for anyone who breaches the measure designed to prevent new waves of coronavirus from overseas.Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefing on Covid-, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK Governmentrsquos chief scientic adviser, said test results were not conclusive enough to catch every case

are likely to be asymptomatic.ldquoThe reason a negative test is not very predictive isyoursquove just caught the disease, you incubate it for a few days when you will test negative, he said.ldquoYou start to test positive maybe at around five days, maybe a bit sooner, and you may be shedding a lot of virus for a couple of days then and for a few days afterwards.ldquoAnd then you gradually recover

but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in particular, as much normality as possible in the school environment is really important.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot underestimate the challenges of that but it is absolutely central to all of this careful planning that is underway."},{"url":null,"title":"can-pubs-reopen-glasgow-plan-ease-lockdown-revealed","story":"The four-phase plan will begin as of next week, with a number of measures being relaxed on May .More outdoor activity including sportsmeeting other households and the re-opening of recycling centres are among those being re-introduced at what is being described as Phase .But these areentirely dependent on dramatically reducing coronavirusin the country and successfully implementing a ldquoTest and Protect strategy.For those of us hankering for a leisurely drink in our local, the subject of ing to Scotlands pubs has been addressed in the route map.Current lockdown restrictions mean pubs and restaurants have been forced to close.The measures introduced yesterday also reveal that pubs will be forced to remain closed during Phase  -

It can be a lesaver, too. Don has talked publicly about his struggles with depression over the years, reiterating how his dogs helped him through the darkest times. Many reading this now will be able to relate. Even those who have never suffered from clinical depression may find themselves struggling to negotiate the loneliness of lockdown. At the most fundamental level dogs give us something to live for, something to get out of bed for. They love us evenwe donrsquot love ourselves. They heal us gladly, unknowingly, just by being themselves.And thatrsquos medical fact. Scientic studies show how dogs reduce stress, depression, loneliness and anxiety. They make us healthier, physically and mentally, by encouraging us to take exercise and socialise. People with dogs have lower blood pressure and are less likely to develop heart disease than others.

And they encourage us to find even a small amount of happiness in every moment, regardless of how bleak it seems.:Susan Swarbrick: How dogs are enriching our lives more than everAs humanity tries to find a way through the coronavirus our ability to understand its signicance is both a blessing and a misfortune.

They believe this will allow the creative energies of the people, ground down by the nine to five, to be released.New ideas will flourish. Voluntary work will become the norm. Wersquoll all become poets and musicians. Only worthwhile jobs will remain because no one need do any work they donrsquot want to do ndash like empty bins or sell stuff.It is a pleasant fantasy, and taken seriously by many visionaries, including tech billionaires like Facebookrsquos Mark Zuckerberg and Teslarsquos Elon Musk, who wonder what is going to be done with all the surplus people once everything is automated.Nicola Sturgeon is an advocate of UBI and has more or less promised it in an independent Scotland. There are trials under way in Scottish councils.Most fans of UBI regard themselves as being on the left, like Barack Obama and Yanis Varoufakis. However, the idea has a long history on the right.The famous Alaskan scheme, the Permanent Fund Dividend , was introduced by a Republican Governor, Jay Hammond, in . The recently-completed UBI experiment in Finland was initiated by a right-wing government which included the True Finns in .Now, Irsquom not playing the Twitter game here of guilt by association. An idea can be worthwhile no matter who supports it. However, it is not an accident that UBI is attractive to tech plutocrats and small state visionaries.To those on the left, UBI seems like an exercise in humane wealth redistribution, and to a certain extent it is. But those on the right see it very dferently: as a means of undermining the big state. Citizenrsquos income becomes a lever against spending policies.In Alaska, the Independent Democrat governor, Bill Walker, recently tried to reduce the PFD in order to improve education funding. Last year he was defeated by the Republican Mike Dunleavy who promised instead to double the UBI, and cut public spending in the state by pound. billion.Public services being sacriced in order to put more free money into peoplesrsquo pockets isnrsquot quite what advocates of UBI envisage. But there is a logic here:peoplersquos incomes are determined exclusively by the state, politics will become about the level of that distribution.Imagine a system in which everyone receives pound, a year, as proposed by the Reform Scotland think tank. Leave aside the increase in taxes required to pay for it. Rich or poor old or young, you get the same chunk of change from HM Government.First off, this is not enough to live on and is the same as the current level of Universal Credit, currently pound a week. It is a mystery to me why this is seen as a boon to humankind. A whole raft of means-tested benefits would have to be added on top, like housing benefit, disability benefit and child benefit.UBI advocates say: well, itrsquos only a start. Anyway, people can top it up with a job. But think of what happens at election time Along comes the Real Income Party of Fiscal Fortitudeled by a charismatic populist who says, like Dunleavy in Alaska: ldquoThis isnrsquot a universal income itrsquos universal poverty. Vote for me and Irsquoll double it.Since taxes will already be sky high to pay for UBI phase one, he or she will promise to pay by making the state more ldquoefficient. Get rid of bureaucrats. Cut waste. End subsidies. Get rid of immigrants trying to grab our money.This populist aspect of UBI hasnrsquot been considered because most of the existing UBI experiments are not UBI. In Finland, , long-term unemployed were given euro a month for two years subject to a means test. The results were indferent, though most of the recipients said they felt better. But this was not UBI, which is meant to be given to everyone, working or not.Spain is about to introduce another non-UBI. The Socialist-Podemos government is planning a non-contributory cash payment of around euro, a month restricted to families who fall out of the existing means-tested social safety net.Neither the Spanish nor the Finnish scheme is inidual, unconditional or universal, the three key criteria for UBI. Politicians hailing these schemes, like Labourrsquos Rebecca Long-Bailey, appear to be unaware of this.Other schemes exist in the developing world. The biggest, in Kenya covering , villagers and paid for by the US charity GiveDirectly, has been under way since . It has been praised for not constituting a disincentive to work. But since the UBI there is only  dollars a month, that is perhaps not surprising.Any UBI worth the name in a country like the UK would have to be set at something close to average wages. Otherwise, what is the point  I simply donrsquot see the sense in offering people a UBI at the same poverty level as Universal Credit.And to give a living UBI to everyone, wealthy included, and then tax everyone massively to pay for it, seems to be a perverse form of redistribution.UBI is addressing a serious issue. Think tanks claim that automation will kill a third of all routine jobs. Capitalism doesnrsquot need big workforces any more because it has evolved beyond industrialisation.But UBI is not the way. The benefits of automation should be spread by taxation, shorter hours and higher pay, not by creating a society of serfs living on a miserable stipend.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A shop assistant was palpably distressed as she told me she couldnrsquot go with her pregnant daughter for her scan, or see the twins she usually collects twice a week from school. One of my friends had booked to fly to Australia to be with her daughter when her baby ndash the first grandchild ndash arrived. Instead, she is stranded thousands of miles away, anxiously watching the calendar, and knitting, knitting, knitting.Itrsquos no surprise that the likes of Zoom and Facetime have become emotional le-rafts, with everyone rushing to climb aboard. Earlier this week, my sister was making granola with an eight-year-old, an hourrsquos drive away in Glasgow. With four of her grandsons in one household, portal sessions can be chaotic. The two-year-old usually makes an appearance only at the bottom of the screen, detected by a tuft of blond hair moving at speed beyond reach.If you could see the profiles of those using this technology, yoursquod find it flooded with retirees, desperate for a glimpse of their families and their youngest. It might be a poor substitute for a hug, but most would agree that online chats are better than nothing. Children grow so swtly, time-lapse photography would make you giddy. They shoot up faster than Leylandii, and learn new words every day. My great-nephewrsquos favourite just now is ldquodisgusting. He applies this to his motherrsquos cooking.Half the older population is probably, like me, filling their devices with adorable pictures, and frantically upgrading their cloud storage to contain it all. It makes me wonder, did my grandparents delight in photos of my siblings and me  Irsquoll never know. Thinking of them is like going back to another place and time ndash which is where, as Edwardian Londoners, they came from. When I was a girl, most folk were considered decrepit at . And often they were, worn out from work and hardship. Reaching retirement was the time for pipe and slippers rather than bungee jumping or skying. The grandchildren who visited once a week, or month, or at Christmas, were patted on the head, spoken to in a loud voice, and indulged with sweets. When it was time to leave, there was rarely any protest.I used to envy school friends whose aged relatives were closely involved with their lives. Today, that closeness is taken for granted, as the older folks work a rota, caring for youngsters after school or during holidays, while their parents work.It is one of the loveliest rapports to observe. In a culture that puts a lot of pressure on the young, to do well at school or university, to look good and be popular, the advice and companionship of those who have seen it all, and take a relaxed view, is invaluable. Therersquos much hand-wringing about the state of modern society, with fractured or dysal families causing heartache and instability. Not much is said, however, of the role grandparents play in holding things together and nurturing those on the first and most precarious rungs of le.Adjectives that can be applied to most working mothers and fathers include irritable, harassed and exhausted. Those over , especially once their careers have ended, have shot those rapids and are in calmer waters. Grandchildren instinctively recognise that theyrsquoll find in them a champion who puts them first, whether itrsquos as a bulwark against strict rules and nagging, or simply someone who isnrsquot always watching the clock. Time and patience are the most important gt a grandparent has to give: to play, read, go for a walk, watch a film, or take a child to football practice and roar encouragement from the sidelines. It doesnrsquot really matter what they actually do together, simply having someonersquos attention for a few hours is priceless. And for granddads especially, I suspect, itrsquos a chance to offer something they had in too short supply when they were raising their own brood.In terms of the family machine, therersquos never been a time when this ageing cohort has been more crucial to its smooth running. With most parents working within a year or two of a childrsquos birth, the period when offspring need to be collected from nursery, or be cared for after school or out of term-time, has signicantly expanded. Only recently have economists begun to calculate the worth of this unpaid army of nannies, chauffeurs, shuttlers, carers, cooks, cleaners and counsellors.It wonrsquot surprise anyone who falls into this group to learn that the hidden price of childcare on the national balance sheet is huge. One analysis in  estimated that, on average, such help annually saves a family pound. Thatrsquos pound billion across the UK. Few grandparents would ever see their contribution in pounds and pence, even those who are far from well-off themselves. Yet it is implicitly understood that without their help, countless thousands of households would struggle to hold down their jobs and make ends meet.The ongoing effect of Covid  on contact between generations could be profound. As the world s to work, many grandparents will be obliged to watch on, from relative isolation, for who knows how much longer But for most who are in this predicament, itrsquos not the maths thatrsquos worrying them. It is the absence of physical contact: fingers sticky with chocolate, displays of cartwheels and bunny jumps, revision schedules more complicated than a ScotRail timetable. And it is a two-way loss, children missing out as much as they do. The loving web that binds young and old is usually invisible, and passes largely unnoticed. Yet, as wersquoll soon see, itrsquos a crucial network that keeps the country running.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Thatrsquos a slightly dferent journey to those on the London Underground ndash where ordinary folk packed into carriages after Boris Johnson said people who cannot work from home should get back in the harness. Johnson also blithely said workers should avoid public transport. As the packed tube trains show, not everyone can afford to own a car, or live in the centre of city so they can walk or cycle to work.Grant Shapps, Tory transport secretary, says he wouldnrsquot travel by bus or train, and claims itrsquos a ldquocivic duty to avoid public transport. It isnrsquot a civic duty to die because of government stupidity. Deaths among transport workers are mounting. The arrogance of wealth is becoming as sickening as the virus itself.Itrsquos not just the low-paid who are victims of this gross inequality ndash the average white collar worker is just as vulnerable. In England, teachers are under pressure to get back into the classroom despite no guarantees for their safety.All this, while the UK government pushes through anti-immigration legislation, as migrant workers keep us alive in hospitals. We clap for our NHS workers today, while preparing to kick them out tomorrow.The disabled are being laid off, funding for the homeless during coronavirus is now drying up, food banks canrsquot cope with demand.This disregard for the lives and dignity of ordinary workers is in the DNA of our society.

Every board should have half of its membership elected from the workforce. That way shareholder greed can be curbed, lay-offs prevented where theyrsquore unnecessary, pay fairly apportioned, rights protected, staff respected.Other countries do this to a limited extent and their economies havenrsquot tanked like ours.

What happened was that, during a News at Ten programme, Ms Smith said Nicola Sturgeon had ldquoenjoyed the opportunity to set out her own lockdown rules and not have to follow whatrsquos happening in England and other parts of the UK.But the First Minister took umbrage at this. ldquoNever in my entire political career have I lsquoenjoyedrsquo anything less than this, she said. ldquoMy heart breaks every day for all those who have lost loved ones to this virus. Which prompted Ms Smith to try to clary things: ldquoI had meant to say hellip she has lsquoembracedrsquo the opportunity to make a policy unique to Scotland. I said enjoyedrsquo by mistake.Now, I have no idea what Ms Smithrsquos political opinions are, but there are a few things worth saying about the original news report and the First Ministerrsquos response to it because they reveal quite a bit about the BBC, the SNP, and the relationship between politics and journalism.First, the news report. The problem with reports of this kind in which broadcasters are asked to analyse the dayrsquos events is that theyrsquore trying to do an almost impossible job: analyse whatrsquos going on while appearing to be totally factual and unbiased: in other words, express an opinion without appearing to express an opinion.But the premise is flawed. Sarah Smith. Me. You. We are not unbiased. As soon as a journalist decides to cover one story or another ndash or use one word or another ndash they are being influenced by unconscious bias. Ms Smith was also self-evidently not giving us untainted facts, she was expressing an opinion and it would helpthe BBC used the right word for it ndash opinion ndash and stopped acting, in its rather hoighty-toighty way, like itrsquos completely unbiased. It isnrsquot: it seeks to control bias, which is a totally dferent thing.But as well as defending Sarah Smith, Irsquod also like to make an appeal to the First Minister here, because her response leaves a lot to be desired. First, her tweet was doing a thing that journalists get a lot: responding with how-dare-you horror to something you havenrsquot actually said. Ms Smith was suggesting the First Minister was enjoying, or embracing, the political elements of the crisis, not the personal consequences for the victims, and it was unfair of Ms Sturgeon to suggest otherwise with talk of loved ones and broken hearts.Ms Sturgeon also needs to be careful about the pot she stirs. I was talking to a colleague recently who told me that hersquod been seeing a therapist because of the vilication and mockery hersquod received from SNP supporters, including ministers, and the effect that it had on his self-confidence. You might say: \"If you dish it out, you gotta take it\", but all I would say to senior SNP politicians, including the First Minister, is: before you single out a journalist, take a look behind you at the snarly hordes you are about to unleash and encourage.The other problem with tweets like the First Ministerrsquos is that they encourage something  thatrsquos troubling: a belief among some of her supporters that the BBC is institutionally anti-independence. The BBC is like any other large organisation in Scotland: there are people in it who believe in independence and there are people who donrsquot, and it does at least have rules that seek impartiality. But, in tweet after tweet, its critics accuse it of being anti-independence and the result is what psychologists call an availability cascade: a belief that grows because of the number of people saying it.The cascade also has another curious effect. SNP supporters who believe the BBC is biased against independence have boycotted its coverage. For them, this preserves the cascade, but the problem for the BBC is that other viewers ndash unionists, left-wingers, right-wingers ndash are doing the same thing for dferent reasons.Which leads us back to poor Sarah Smith standing there with a microphone trying to navigate it all and appear neutral. What shersquos saying to us is: ldquoTrust me, Irsquom a journalist ndash a neutral, unbiased BBC journalist. But perhaps the BBC could be more honest about whatrsquos really going on: she is expressing an opinion. And perhaps, when she hears the opinion, the First Minister could try to be a little less touchy.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

After three years in the making, the release date for Eye Of The Storm coincided smack bang with the upheaval and uncertainty of a global pandemic. The bands upcoming tour, scheduled for May and June, was swtly shelved.\"All those plans were up in smoke as soon as coronavirus came in and changed everything,\" says singer-songwriter Robert Robertson, his voice drting down the line from Fort William, where he has been staying with family since lockdown began.Yet, what seemed like bad timing, soon proved to be serendipity. For a start, the albums title has proved uncannily apt given humanitys current plight.Then theres the raft of lyrics which, although penned long before anyone had ever heard of Covid-, are filled with heartfelt sentiment about overcoming adversity and the need for a strong sense of community.The band ndash lead vocalist Robertson, Ross Wilson on keyboards, guitarist Alasdair Turner and drummer Gus Munro ndash did a -night virtual world tour at the end of April, ahead of the album being released earlier this month.Flying aboard \"Tide Lines Airways\", they city-hopped, via Google Earth, to New York, Paris, London, Moscow, Cairo, Rio, Tokyo, Sydney and Rome, before rounding off the tour in Tobermory on Mull, the island that Wilson hails from.:Island odyssey: Tamsin Calidas lays bare le on a Hebridean croft ndash from ruin to redemptionTheir goal was for Eye Of The Storm ndash which the band produced themselves ndash to make the UK Top . Impressively, it debuted at No, simultaneously topping both the Scottish and independent album charts.So, who are Tide Lines  Here, we learn more about the bands remarkable journey to date.ORIGIN STORYThe four-strong line-up packs a pedigree. Tide Lines was formed in  after Robertson and Wilson parted ways with Scottish traditional band, Skipinnish, to experiment with their own music. They recruited Turner for his guitar and bagpipes prowess, and Munro, formerly the drummer with alt-rock trio Sucioperro.Less than  hours after the bands official launch on social media in June , their first single, Far Side Of The World, entered the UK download charts ahead of tracks by Coldplay, Beyonce and Adele. Tide Lines takes its name from a lyric in the song that goes: \"In my mind I see her smile, where the tide lines grace the isle\". A debut album, Dreams We Never Lost, followed in .THEIR DISTINCTIVE SOUNDFolk philosophy and big guitars are among Tide Lines signature style. Or as Robertson puts it: \"A melting pot of musical influences come out when we are in the studio.\" His love of classic artists, such as Bruce Springsteen, is juxtaposed alongside Wilson and Turners passion for electronica, and Munros alt-rock background.Robertson has been writing songs since childhood. \"I have early memories of being in the car with my mum and dad on a long journey and when we got to our destination, I had written out lyrics and a tune on the back of an envelope.\"What normally happens is a melody randomly comes into my head. I have been walking through an airport before when thats happened and needed to quickly stop and record it on my phone. Afterwards, I sit down and try to develop the tune, the chords and put words to it.\"Once I have it at the stage where its - per cent there, Ill take it to the boys andthey give the thumbs up, we will book into a studio and jam it. Thats when our dferent musical influences come to the fore. Everyone adds in their ideas and it can sometimes change beyond all recognition from my original idea with their input. It is very collaborative.\"ASKING TAYLOR SWIFT ON A DATERobertson and Wilson recorded a cover version of Taylor Swts hit Shake It Off in . The video went viral with Outlander star Sam Heughan among those sharing it in a bid to catch Swts eye. Robertson offered to take the American singer-songwriter out for dinner in Glasgow.:Lockdown Learnings: Coal, steel and a way of le swept away ndash delving into family history\"I asked her for a curryI remember rightly,\" he says. \"The offer still stands. I have no memory of why we decided to cover it, but it was a good laugh. That was before we formed Tide Lines.\"TAPPING INTO THE ZEITGEISTIt is impossible not to be struck by the myriad lines woven throughout Eye Of The Storm that could have been written as astute reflections of le in lockdown.\"Theres lot of the lyrics on the new album that people are relating to because of this situation,\" confirms Robertson. \"There is a line in Shadow To The Light that goes: Theres a place I see, in the all-too-distant light  Of the sun and rain  And no matter what lies ahead of us now  We will be OK.\"That was written long before I had ever heard of coronavirus and I didnt realise how appropriate it is until people pointed it out. The emphasis is on what lies ahead of us ndash rather than you or me as iniduals. It is about the sense of community.\"A LOVE OF GAELICGiven that Robertson won the prestigious An Comunn Gaidhealach Gold Medal for singing at the  Royal National Mod in Paisley, a fierce passion for Gaelic should come as little surprise.Eye Of The Storm has a cover of Canan nan Gaidheal ndash which translates as Language of the Gaels ndash by the late Lewis-born poet and songwriter Murdo Macfarlane.\"The thing that runs through our music is the influence of growing up with Gaelic, folk songs and living in the Highlands,\" says Robertson. \"The general content of the subjects I write about ndash landscapes, love and longing ndash are probably quite similar to those that have inspired Gaelic songs over the years.\":Is it a bird  Is it a plane  The strangest unexplained sightings in Scotlandrsquos skiesIn March, inspired by footage of people singing from windows and balconies around the world, Robertson sang a few lines of a Gaelic song from his second-floortenement flat in Glasgow. The clip has been shared more than a million times.THAT IMPROMPTU \"WORLD\" TOUR\"The best way to promote an album is to go out and play it live,\" says Robertson. \"Thanks to the joys of social media I was able to go live from the comfort of my own living room.\"On the first night, there was a little Tide Lines aeroplane taking you from Fort William to New York on Google Earth. I came on and sang Welcome To New York by Taylor Swt, then New York, New York by Frank Sinatra.\"I did one song from the album each night for  nights leading up to its release. To represent each city or country on the tour, I had a prop Id found around the house. For Paris I had red wine and grapes. In Italy, it was a little glass of cloudy apple juice I pretended was limoncello.\"I would get records from my dads collection for each place. There was Michelle by The Beatles for Paris and I sang Back In The USSR for Moscow. Id say: Tomorrow were in Cairo, what should I sing  People suggested songs like Night Boat To Cairo and Walk Like An Egyptian.\"AVOIDING THE CURSE OF THE DIFFICULT SECOND ALBUMAs the old adage goes, fortune favours the brave. Their best-laid plans may have been upended by the coronavirus pandemic, but the band pressed on. \"The album was released on May  and on the Monday after that, the Official Charts Company had us at No for the whole of the UK,\" he says.\"Of course, we were surrounded in that chart by artists who are world-famous and have a major record label behind them with all the benefits that brings. Realistically, we knew that as the week went on, we were going to go flying back down the charts but hoped to stay within the UK Top .\"We ended up at No in the UK and were absolutely delighted. Then, finding out we were No in Scotland and No in the independent album charts, we couldnt believe it.:Island odyssey: Tamsin Calidas lays bare le on a Hebridean croft ndash from ruin to redemption\"There was a statistic from the Official Charts Company that said not only were we No in Scotland, but for that week, we outsold the rest of the Top  combined.

The media eats itself.Dooley can be likeably daffy sometimes. ldquoKev, that squirrel is alive, she announced, gazing out the window. ldquoOr itrsquos another squirrel.She got the most out of people though, and among the largely banal observations there was the odd insight into the strange world of lockdown living. Oh, and Elly had her baby. A boy, Henry. Or as Dooley called him: ldquoA little ray of sunshine in all this madness.\"Scotlandrsquos latest contribution to the boom in DIY programme making was Jamie Genevieversquos Great Indoors. If you donrsquot know who Jamie Genevieve is then you are likely to be some old fogey over the age of . BBC Scotland calls her ldquoScotlandrsquos biggest internet personality. She describes herself on Twitteras a ldquoScottish make up artist, YouTuber, weekly vlogger, we, dog mum and self-care enthusiast. Sounds exhausting.With her husband, Jack, as co-presenter, JG promised over three shows to have a go at DIY, cooking, keeping in touch with friends and followers, and learning new skills. In short, the same thing everyone  and their dog are doing at the moment.The couple threw in some \"fun\" challenges, too, including how many Jaffa cakes they could eat in a minute. Jack had his hair cut by his we, she showed viewers how to make their lips look more plump, and there was time to make a batch of banana muffins. It was as interesting as watching two coats of mascara dry.At least the pair of them had a sense of humour and were not bad company. It was like hanging out with a young relative and her boyfriend, perfectly pleasant but you wouldnrsquot want to do it every night.As you may have noticed from the ever increasing number of repeats in the schedules, the effect of the lockdown on programme making is beginning to take its toll. This week saw the last River City for a while.Broadcasters including STV, ITV, BBC, Sky, Channel , and Channel , have been working on safety guidelines so they canto programme making at some point. In the meantime, expect more cheap to make DIY material.So stand by those iPads and wait for the offer of your very own lockdown show.

People were indulging in all these activities across Scotlands beaches yesterday, with many having travelled out of their local areas for recreation, although this isnt supposedly allowed until May .Phase  also envisages agriculture and forestry resuming but in the fields of lambs I see from my house the farmers have never ndash thankfully ndash stopped working.Phase  also encompasses \"no longer discouraging takeaways and drive-throughs from opening\" but again thankfully, takeaways in Anstruther, Cupar and St Andrews have been open for some weeks.It seems to me that Ms Sturgeons route map is behind the curve, and she needs to get in step with what the great Scottish public is already doing.Otherwise this intricate, and illogical staggered plan of dos and donts will only undermine the credibility of the First Minister and empower ever more people to go their own way.Linda Holt , Anstruther.MISHAL Husain of BBC Radio  interviewed David Nabarro from the World Health Organisation last Friday.I was shouting at the radio in total agreement with his addressing the issue of personal behaviour and personal responsibility in this pandemic.He raised the very important question, does the population get it  Do we really understand what is going on and how we need to behave  Clearly, we should only unlock when the answer to this is yes. I fear, too many of us believe that unlocking is \"back to normal\".The success of this virus,you want to call it that, is in its ability to exploit weaknesses. The resulting pandemic has certainly exposed the underlying health issues in our population as well those in our systems, our key services. These in turn have also exposed weak and slow political decision-making and in some cases incompetent messaging, the consequences for which in terms of death will have political and financial cost which will play out in due course.Dr Nabarro stated that \"its personal behaviour as well thats extremely important in reducing the likelihood of explosive outbreaks developing over the summer and into the autumn\".When asked about the setting of dates for reducing restrictions he continued: \"My request to all countries, that rather than giving precise dates, they say well release the lockdown when we know that weve got the defence mechanisms in place, when we know that our people understand the severity of this virus.\"Before we take the next small unlocking step, we need to check that we all know what we have to do. My fear is that we are nowhere near putting a tick in that last box. I think the politicians need to be honest and pay more attention to the messaging. It feels like too many of us have the impression that unlocking is a binary event that puts us back to normal. Lets face it, we arent going back to normal any time soon, certainly not this year. Our ability to understand where we are with this, to understand what we need to do and to adopt those behaviours is the next test. If we fail here, that is a weakness the virus will exploit next, for sure.Lets stop and think it through, what effect is my behaviour having on my family and others, perhaps more vulnerable  Could my behaviour make others anxious  Is my behaviour helping or hindering the transmission of this virus Im sure though that we are smart enough to get our heads around this and start really caring for each other so that perhaps well never get back to normal, but to something much better.David Morrish, Banchory.PANDEMICS are not like other global crises. They are dynamic, full of uncertainty, spread very fast as a result of modern transport and communications and affect whole populations. Yet we routinely ignore these low probability, high impact threats without thinking broadly and deeply about the disruption and cost. And we often quickly forget afterwards or fall rapidly into previous behaviours.I hope that the Scottish Government will commission a public inquiry in the near future so we can all learn the lessons ndash good and bad ndash from Covid- and its aftermath.Such an inquiry needs to draw on evidence, opinion and good ideas from all segments of our society from the public and private sectors and from academia and research and development. It must be impartial and transparent.It needs to consider what can be done in the future by those at the coal face as well as in Holyrood and all parts of our citizenship in between. Input needs to be collected now not when this pandemic has subsided.Lastly, lessons captured need to be learned and converted into best practice by an organisation set up especially and dedicated to ensure we improve resilience across our society and are better prepared for the next similar challenge.Malcolm Warr, Prestwick.Read more: Sturgeon publishes route map out of lockdown"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-swinney-backs-away-target-2000-contact-tracers-june","story":"The Deputy First Minister said the current  tracers would be ldquosufficient to get the system up and running next week, despite an official target of  by June .Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, he said ldquoevery effort would be made to increase the numbers, but offered no guarantee another  would be ready next week.The retreat comes just a day after Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood the target would not be missed, telling MSPs the plans were ldquonot lagging behind but ldquomoving at pace.She said: ldquoWe will have a capacity of  in place by the end of this month.

It is critical for specic issues, for example, theto schools.Earlier this week, the Scottish Government announced contact new tracing technology was being trialled in Fe, Lanarkshire and Highland health boards.Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said an initial group of  tracers made up of NHS staff were ldquoready to begin this work, as part of the process of recruiting up to  staff.She later said the  staff would be ldquoready to be deployed on June .However on Good Morning Scotland, Mr Swinney was noticeably less confidentwhen askedthere had been any new recruits above the existing .He said: ldquoSix hundred is the last number that I have available to me, and thatrsquos sufficient contact tracers to get the system up and running for what we require at the end of this month.Pressed on the June target, he said: ldquoIrsquom sure every effort will be made to increase the numbers, but  is a good contingent of numbers to have in place to begin the work on contact tracing.ldquoContact tracing is only valuable where you have suppressed the level of coronavirus in the community to be able to manage all of those contacts and to pursue them.ldquoSo we will have the resources in place to do that so that we can take forward the test and protect strategy that the First Minister outlined yesterday.ldquoAnd that will be anintegral part in supporting the decisions that we can take under the route map to further relax the constraints that people are operating under.His comments contrasted with Ms Sturgeonrsquos statementto MSPs after she published her map andopposition parties queried the governments ability totestand trace at scale.She denied the government was behind schedule and insisted a ldquosubstantial, signicant test and protection operation would be ready in all  regional health boards next week.She told MSPs: ldquoI want to align our lting of lockdown with our ability to implement a substantial, signicant test and protect operation.

but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes that: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.For the first phase of reopening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Local authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean looking at places like outdoor space in schools, as well as libraries, community halls, leisure centres, conference centres and even taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation to use as classrooms.As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in particular, as much normality as possible in the school environment is really important.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot underestimate the challenges of that but it is absolutely central to all of this careful planning that is underway."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11400487.jpg?type=article-full","title":"can-pubs-reopen-glasgow-plan-ease-lockdown-revealed","story":"The four-phase plan will begin as of next week, with a number of measures being relaxed on May .More outdoor activity including sportsmeeting other households and the re-opening of recycling centres are among those being re-introduced at what is being described as Phase .But these areentirely dependent on dramatically reducing coronavirusin the country and successfully implementing a ldquoTest and Protect strategy.For those of us hankering for a leisurely drink in our local, the subject of ing to Scotlands pubs has been addressed in the route map.Current lockdown restrictions mean pubs and restaurants have been forced to close.The measures introduced yesterday also reveal that pubs will be forced to remain closed during Phase  -

one of the causes of the common cold - as a conduit to deliver genetic material to the cells that codes for SARS-CoV-.These cells then produce the virus distinctive spike protein, and travel to the lymph nodes where the immune system creates antibodies that will be able torecognise that spike protein and fight off the coronavirus.Volunteers were enrolled from one site in Wuhan, China, and assigned to receive either low, medium or high doses of the vaccine.: NHS staff in Glasgow asked to join Covid vaccine trialThe researchers tested the volunteersrsquo blood at regular intervals following vaccination to see whether the vaccine stimulated both antibody and T cell production - the two strands of human immune response.It is thought that the ideal vaccine will be able to generate both antibody and T cell responses.After  days, most participants had a four-fold increase in binding antibodies, which that can attach to the coronavirus but do not necessarily attack it.However, half to three-quarters of participants had developed neutralising antibodies, which do attack pathogens.Importantly, the Ad-nCoV vaccine also stimulated a rapid T-cell response in the majority of volunteers, which was greater in those given the higher and middle doses of vaccine.T-cells are important because they are capable of recognising and destroying other cells in the bodyinfected with the virus ndash not just the viral pathogen itself.Further analyses showed that  days after vaccination, the majority of recipients showed either a positive T-cell response or had detectable neutralising antibodies.: Covid spread like cruise ship after patients were transferred from Glasgow superhospital into open bay wardsHowever, the authors note that both the antibody and T-cell response could be reduced by high pre-existing immunity to adenovirus type .A randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase  trial of the Ad-nCoV vaccine has now been initiated in Wuhan to determine whether the results can be replicated, andthere are any adverse events up to six months after vaccination.It will involve  participants being given dferent doses of the vaccine or a placebo vaccine."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-on-track-meet-2-000-contact-tracer-target-may-needed","story":"A key part to the ScottishGovernmentrsquos route map to easing the lockdown is an expandedtesting capacity and enough contact tracers to roll it outas part of its test, trace and isolate strategy.Yesterday the Conservatives saidMsSturgeon and the Scottish Government needed to ldquosignicantly up its game on the contacting and isolating of infected people for the exit strategy to be successful.:Coronavirus: Nicola Sturgeon warns good judgement needed or lives of loved ones at riskThe Scottish Greens added thatthe route map to lting the lockdown had to be backed up by ldquorobust testing and tracing.MsSturgeon warned that more than ,, the original target of contact tracers, may be needed for the system to be effective and added that Scotland is ldquovery close to being able to process , Covid- tests a day.Shesuggested thatmore testing and tracers may be required, depending on \"the requirements the virus places on us\".The First Ministerechoed the words of her deputy, John Swinney, byconfirmingthere are  contact tracers currently in place,but added that there areanother  recruits \"at ious stages of the appointment and training process\".:Coronavirus: Swinney backs away from target of  contact tracers by JuneShe also said there had been around , expressions of interest after theScottishGovernment advertised for the roles, with the deadline expiring today.\"All of that is on track and continues to make progress,\"MsSturgeon said.\"Weve got to be mindful of not getting too fixed in our minds about these numbers,\" she added.:Coronavirus: Opposition warn Sturgeon plan may fail unless testing improvesldquoItis important we build up to that capacity but as of the end of the month we may well not need all , contact tracers and we may not need all of the testing capacity.\"But we need to have it, in case we need it in the future and of course we may have to go beyond the , and the , in future.\"We have to remain flexible in our ability to scale up depending on the requirements the virus places on us.\""},{"url":null,"title":"allotments-lockdown-patch-soil-provides-food-soul-well-plate","story":"Now in her th year of holding an allotment at Bridgend Growing Communities near Craigmillar, the former mental health officer visits nearly every day and appreciates the routine required to maintain it.She said: \"I was brought up with a beautul garden and knew the joy of eating fresh vegetables from garden to table.

Trees, shrubs and other woody plants such as brambles are best cut down and dug out, while woody waste can be shredded and compostedbull Dont overlook the weeding. Weeding is vital to maintaining an allotment as not only does it protect the plants by creating space and loosening the soil, it allows water to access roots more rapidly.bull When clear of weeds the soil can be broken up, and ideally then add organic matter by digging or rotovating, or while building raised beds.bull Practise companion planting by planting dferent crops in close proximity that act as pest control, allow pollination and provide habitat for beneficial insects.bull Make use of any leftover wood or tools by recycling them into planters or other helpful equipment like a compost bin.bull If youre a beginner, consider tackling only half the plot in the first year so you can get to know the land and stay motivated.bull Get to know your soil ndash is it sandy, clay or otherwise  Dferent conditions require dferent treatments and seeds. Plants can grow dferently in each and they can affect drainage and nutrients they need.bull Dont hang around ndash the sooner you get planting, the sooner you can reap the benefits."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmScottish Opera have created a series of online teaching resources for schools and families to allow everyone get involved in their primary school production, Fever!

Mr Jack said: #Members of Parliament are key workers. More importantly, as a cabinet minister and a secretary of state, it is right that I should be here in the chamber so that I can be properly scrutinised and answer these questions.#I came down at the weekend and travelled on a train very safely. I willsafely and I will be isolating myself when I do, but that is solely because I go back to family.

Signicant adjustments will also be required across our public transport services as the lockdown is eased in the coming weeks and months and the safety of the travelling public is hugely important.“The committee wants to hear about the experiences of iniduals and businesses and whether they feel they have received the support they need to survive and recover from this crisis.“We also want to learn about examples of good practice as we consider what lessons can be learned about the response to the pandemic and also how existing practices may need to change as we move forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also understandable that Ministers want safeguards in place to ensure that public funds are being allocated appropriately.“However, it is clear that requiring applicants to evidence use of a business bank account is causing real problems for many small businesses in the tourism sector.  Many were advised by their own banks to use personal bank accounts to run their operations. Having taken that advice, many now find it is denying them access to the support they desperately need.“BB owners are the backbone of an already vulnerable tourism sector in Orkney and, like other businesses, are facing an uphill challenge at this time. Yet, it is almost asthey haven’t been considered to be a viable business at all, which is deeply frustrating.“I have been raising this issue with the Finance Secretary for a number of weeks now and was encouraged by Kate Forbes’ recognition of the problem and her willingness to keep looking at how this gap in support might be closed. So far, Ministers have been willing to widen criteria and make improvements to funds where needed. I hope the same can happen in this instance so that the hardship fund can continue to target support at those businesses that it was designed to help.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters.

Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers.

But we will still be there to follow our four e’s approach, particularly in regards of enforcement when we see large gatherings of people that don’t heed the guidance.” The chief constable said there will be less police officers conducting road checks across NI this weekend, but that the force will still be visible.First Minister Arlene Foster also appealed to the public to maintain the guidance this weekend. “Covid- is still lurking, it thrives when people become complacent and it spreads when people become blase about public health advice and it kills when people start acting like the threat is no longer there.”The pleas come after the latest Department of Health figures showed there have been three further coronavirus deaths in Northern Ireland.

None of the flights I booked were expensive, but it is annoying that the refund I know I am entitled to is so dficult to get.We haven#t incurred huge financial losses, but my husband#s th birthday was spent in the garden and he didn#t get to see family or friends so it was unforgettable - but not in a good way.As it was a surprise, he didn#t know what I had planned until the flights had been cancelled and this only increased the level of disappointment.We don#t go out very much at weekends and our four children are all independent adults living their own lives so we like to spend our savings by going on holiday as often as we can. It isn#t normally three times a year, but it isn#t every year your husband is .We look forward every year to going to new places, exploring our love of architecture and having lazy days on the beach.And while I have a grand back garden that I love spending time in, the thought of doing this in between showers of rain and maybe worse does not fill me with joy. Right now I have my fingers crossed that the coronavirus pandemic will have lessened and maybe air travel will once again be possible so we will get to visit Split at the end of September, but the idea of being on a plane with strangers does concern me.This year has taught me one thing and that is not to be so quick to catch a January bargain.

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach. By David YoungMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailTeacher unions have given a cautious welcome to the Education Minister#s timetable for restarting schools. The Ulster Teachers# Unionwelcomed Peter Weir#s collaborative approach in getting schools back to a #new normal#, while the NASUWT union said it must be done in a way that is safe and commands public confidence.UTU president Stephen McCord said parents should be assured that teachers want children back in school - but only when it#s safe for them to be there.Children should be in school and we are in touch daily with the Education Department and the Education Authority towards that end, he said.We can assure parents and pupils that we are doing everything we can to get children back at school where they belong, but safely back at school.Education cannot be at the price of health and lives. We welcome the fact that the Minister and Education Authority are listening to us as they plot the way ahead - for it is, after all, teachers who are at the chalk face and know what will work for their schools - and what won#t.Dr Patrick Roach, General Secretary of the NASUWT, said the union has previously welcomed the Stormont Executive#s decision not to rush ahead with the reopening of schools.As plans are now starting to be put together in relation to how schools might begin to reopen in the new academic year, it will be critical that the Executive maintains a cautious approach which does not undermine public health or put at risk the health and safety of teachers or children, he said.Once the details emerge of the arrangements, the NASUWT will evaluate them and advise members in the light of the key tests it has established around making schools Covid- secure and minimising risk.The NASUWT#s bottom line remains that no teacher or pupil should be expected toto school until it can be demonstrated that it is safe to do so.NASUWT Northern Ireland representative Justin McCamphill added: While it has been the practice of some schools to reopen for some days at the end of August to prepare for the beginning of the academic year, it would not be acceptable for inidual schools to move their established starting date without agreement with school trade union representatives.Michael Allen, principal of Lisneal College in Londonderry, told the Belfastthat the minister#s announcement was helpful, in that it brought clarity to the # to school# timetable, and put an end to conjecture about Northern Ireland aligning with other parts of the UK, such as England, where schools are toin June. It#s put that speculation to bed, he said.

First Minister Arlene Foster condemned the display, saying: The people of Fermanagh do not want such thugs patrolling our roads.Appealing for information yesterday, the PSNI said last night that police were aware of the incident. However, no reports of suspicious behaviour in the area have been received at this time, it added.Last August army bomb disposal officers and police had been in the area responding to reports that a device had been left there.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

Unfortunately, Guy has asked we pass on this.” ‘Guy’ is Guy Pearce, a British-Australian actor, musician and singer-songwriter and crucially, a man who made a guest appearance at Slaughtneil disco back in . While no reason is given for him deciding to pass on our offer to relive the memories, there is a good chance the trip in Sean McGuigan’s silver Renault  may have something to do with it. “I picked him up in Maghera town – I don’t know who got him there, but that’s where I lted him,” says the current club chairperson. googletag.cmd.push “We were going out the road and it just got immediately dark. It scared the wits out of the poor fella. He said, ‘Jesus mate, where are we going to ’. “The poor fella thought he was getting hijacked, but he went in and did all he needed to do.” Pearce was nearing the end of a three-year stint as ‘Mike Young’ in Australian sitcom ‘Neighbours’ after making his acting debut on the show in . Terry McIl was DJ at the time of Pearce’s visit and recalled how hordes of frenzied teenagers packed Slaughtneil hall to the rafters for a glimpse of the star. googletag.cmd.push “There were , people there the night Guy Pearce came. There was even a marquee at the side of Slaughtneil that night as well as the hall being packed.” he said. “They just came up with this idea that they were going to get Guy Pearce. I had to go and buy myself a radio mic for it. He was civil, a nice fella. “He was good with the people, chatty and friendly. Even with the photographs we have, the stage was packed because everyone was up to get autographs and that kind of thing.”  Among those who had made their way to Slaughtneil with fancy notions of chatting to the Neighbours star were three girls who ended up getting closer than they had bargained for. The rush to the front caused a bit of a crush, and amid the screaming and the heat, a few of the girls who were closest fainted. They were hastily dragged onto the stage by the bouncers. Cathy Rennie was one of those who were lted out of the crowd and said she was sure to make the best of a bad situation. “I don’t know how I got up near the front, to tell you the truth,” said the Dungiven woman. “I don’t even know what he was doing on the stage, whether he was singing or anything, but I just felt myself getting all faint. “The next thing there was somebody lting me. Two bouncers lted me up onto the stage and it was near where he was at. He just looked round and smiled at me and I touched his hand. “I think he had on a black leather jacket and I just grabbed him. It’s a wonder he didn’t take me for assault! “Then I was took to the back of the stage and there were a couple of girls sitting there who had fainted too. We had the best seats in the house.” Cathy recalls how the build-up to the event had reached fever pitch during the week when the details were finally confirmed in the local newspaper. “Momentum was building up all week at school that he was coming to Slaughtneil. I’m almost sure it was confirmed in the Mid Ulster Observer,” she said. “For him to come to Slaughtneil after us watching him on the TV was amazing. Neighbours was the main thing. It was on every day at five o’clock and you rushed home from school to watch it. “The whole thing was unreal, the excitement of ‘imagine you got talking to him’. It was the first time any of us had ever been somewhere there was a star. “We would never have experienced that before, apart from maybe Daniel O’Donnell or Barry McGuigan at the Castle. “I remember Barry McGuigan coming after he was the champion, the Clones Cyclone, and that was a big thing in Dungiven years ago, but Guy Pearce was after that. “It’s not like young ones nowadays who can go to a concert and see Westle, or Girls Aloud or One Direction or whatever. We never had anything like that in our lives. “When I think of Slaughtneil, I always think of that night. It was just class.” The teenagers of south Derry spent over  years filing into Slaughtneil hall, but, for many, the first occasion that springs to mind is that night in ’. Guy Pearce has gone on to have a successful career on both the screen and the stage, and the , who crammed into Slaughtneil hall will claim some credit for sending him on his way.

Unfortunately, Guy has asked we pass on this.” ‘Guy’ is Guy Pearce, a British-Australian actor, musician and singer-songwriter and crucially, a man who made a guest appearance at Slaughtneil disco back in . While no reason is given for him deciding to pass on our offer to relive the memories, there is a good chance the trip in Sean McGuigan’s silver Renault  may have something to do with it. “I picked him up in Maghera town – I don’t know who got him there, but that’s where I lted him,” says the current club chairperson. googletag.cmd.push “We were going out the road and it just got immediately dark. It scared the wits out of the poor fella. He said, ‘Jesus mate, where are we going to ’. “The poor fella thought he was getting hijacked, but he went in and did all he needed to do.” Pearce was nearing the end of a three-year stint as ‘Mike Young’ in Australian sitcom ‘Neighbours’ after making his acting debut on the show in . Terry McIl was DJ at the time of Pearce’s visit and recalled how hordes of frenzied teenagers packed Slaughtneil hall to the rafters for a glimpse of the star. googletag.cmd.push “There were , people there the night Guy Pearce came. There was even a marquee at the side of Slaughtneil that night as well as the hall being packed.” he said. “They just came up with this idea that they were going to get Guy Pearce. I had to go and buy myself a radio mic for it. He was civil, a nice fella. “He was good with the people, chatty and friendly. Even with the photographs we have, the stage was packed because everyone was up to get autographs and that kind of thing.”  Among those who had made their way to Slaughtneil with fancy notions of chatting to the Neighbours star were three girls who ended up getting closer than they had bargained for. The rush to the front caused a bit of a crush, and amid the screaming and the heat, a few of the girls who were closest fainted. They were hastily dragged onto the stage by the bouncers. Cathy Rennie was one of those who were lted out of the crowd and said she was sure to make the best of a bad situation. “I don’t know how I got up near the front, to tell you the truth,” said the Dungiven woman. “I don’t even know what he was doing on the stage, whether he was singing or anything, but I just felt myself getting all faint. “The next thing there was somebody lting me. Two bouncers lted me up onto the stage and it was near where he was at. He just looked round and smiled at me and I touched his hand. “I think he had on a black leather jacket and I just grabbed him. It’s a wonder he didn’t take me for assault! “Then I was took to the back of the stage and there were a couple of girls sitting there who had fainted too. We had the best seats in the house.” Cathy recalls how the build-up to the event had reached fever pitch during the week when the details were finally confirmed in the local newspaper. “Momentum was building up all week at school that he was coming to Slaughtneil. I’m almost sure it was confirmed in the Mid Ulster Observer,” she said. “For him to come to Slaughtneil after us watching him on the TV was amazing. Neighbours was the main thing. It was on every day at five o’clock and you rushed home from school to watch it. “The whole thing was unreal, the excitement of ‘imagine you got talking to him’. It was the first time any of us had ever been somewhere there was a star. “We would never have experienced that before, apart from maybe Daniel O’Donnell or Barry McGuigan at the Castle. “I remember Barry McGuigan coming after he was the champion, the Clones Cyclone, and that was a big thing in Dungiven years ago, but Guy Pearce was after that. “It’s not like young ones nowadays who can go to a concert and see Westle, or Girls Aloud or One Direction or whatever. We never had anything like that in our lives. “When I think of Slaughtneil, I always think of that night. It was just class.” The teenagers of south Derry spent over  years filing into Slaughtneil hall, but, for many, the first occasion that springs to mind is that night in ’. Guy Pearce has gone on to have a successful career on both the screen and the stage, and the , who crammed into Slaughtneil hall will claim some credit for sending him on his way.

Shrouded in darkness on a Friday evening, its charms were not easily advertised, butthe mountain would not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain. But how would south Derry’s teenage prophets get there  “Putting on the Ulsterbuses and all the coaches is what really got it going. They came in fairly quickly and it did the trick,” said current club chairperson Sean McGuigan. “Darragh’s and McLaughlin’s only had maybe four buses and they were a wee bit reluctant to send good buses to the disco. Ulsterbus were a great saviour.” googletag.cmd.push Every Friday evening, a group of hardy bus drivers would set off from towns across Derry, delivering the county’s youth to Slaughtneil hall. It wasn’t for everyone. Pat McGlade, who drove the Draperstown bus for a brief period as the disco was drawing to a close, beat a hasty exit. “I was never at Slaughtneil in my le, I didn’t even know where it was at, but the first night I landed, we got them off and the fighting started,” he said. “I said, ‘JesusI get out of here tonight, I’ll not be back!’. I’d never seen the like of it – they were killing each other that night!” googletag.cmd.push His predecessor, Loup man Sean Glendinning, approached the journey with a little more relish. “They all called me Big Sean for some reason. I wasn’t that big, but I would have gave an odd roar out of me and they sort of listened to me!” he said. “I got on well with them, really. You can’t put old heads on young bodies. You have to be flexible, andyou work with young people, they’ll work with you. “We had no real hassle on the bus, the young people were easy talked to. I gave them a bit of space and they knew how far they could go with you. I never had any hassle. “You’d have got a bit of fighting, but you never passed any remarks on it. It wasn’t too bad, just a bit of a row. “I used to tell the young boys thatthey wanted to box, to go and do it in the ring and earn a bit of money. “The worst bit was whenever the snow was on, you got a bit of a snowballing! There was many a hairy night about it now, but we made it, we got there.” Every night the fleet of drivers was ushered into the club’s kitchen and were wined and dined in traditional GAA style, with plenty of sandwiches, tea and biscuits to be had. “We were well looked after up there,” said Sean. “Once you got there, they took you into the club and Willie Hampson was the main man. You got your tea and all the drivers got a fiver. “You had men from everywhere. The Ulsterbuses came from Kilrea and Dungiven and you had men from all round. Good times and good chat. There was the odd lie told! “The kettle was going and there would be biscuits and a bit of craic. There were four or five in at one time and one or two would have stayed out to keep an eye on the buses.” Willie Hampson is held in high esteem by all the drivers and his hospitality on a Friday night is remembered fondly when they recall the disco. “Willie Hampson looked after the bus drivers and he was some man,” said Colm McGuigan, who started driving the Dungiven bus around . “He used to try and give us all a fiver, but we would have left it all and split it at Christmas time. I would say Slaughtneil got me through twelve Christmases when the weans were young!”  Colm is the current Derry GAA kit man and never tires of reminding the Slaughtneil players of his role in their success. “I used to slag the Slaughtneil men when they came on the Derry team that it was me built their club, bringing all the weans over,” he said. An Ulsterbus employee, he did the school runs by day from Limavady depot, and it was after some pestering from a few of the pupils that the routes to Slaughtneil expanded. “When I started, it was only Dungiven going over to it. They would have gathered at the bus depot and two buses would have left,” said Colm. “A year or so into it, the school weans used to say ‘would you not put a bus on to Slaughtneil ’ “I was in Limavady depot at the time, so I talked to a few of the drivers and we said we’d book a bus ourselves in our own name.” Demand for the bus shot up as hordes of teenagers clamoured for a place every Friday night, but the Troubles still cast a shadow over South Derry in the s and s, and the chances of stumbling on a security checkpoint with an overloaded bus were high. “Some nights there were maybe  weans on the bus, but we were lucky, we were never stopped,” said Colm. “I remember we left Limavady during holiday time with about  in a -seater. Another  or  got on in Drumsurn, another  or  in Ballerin and by that time I was looking down the bus thinking ‘Jesus, how many is in this thing ’ “When I got theof Glenullin, there were  weans standing and I was thinking ‘what am I going to do here ’ “I put the  weans on anyway and they were up in the racks and everywhere, so I said to myself I couldn’t go down onto the main road with these weans. “I had to put the bus into first gear to get it over the top of that hill past the Gaelic pitch and I took it over the back roads into Slaughtneil. “I came back that way and once I got those weans left off in Glenullin, I was happy enough to go down onto the main road again after that!” In order to reduce the potential for mischief on the buses, the GAA club provided bouncers who would travel on the bus with the drivers. Colm generally preferred to police the bus himself and recalls one night in particular when support came from an unlikely corner. “One night I couldn’t get a driver, so I had to drive it myself. This boy got on with a bag of drink,” he said. “Usually you weren’t allowed it, they just poured it down the drain, but this boy was a bit older than the rest of them and had a bag, so I took it off him and told him he’d get it after. “I put it in around the cab. He behaved badly on the way over and I warned him a few times, so coming back again I said, ‘you behave yourself til we get home.’ “He didn’t do so bad until we got theof Drumsurn and he went clean mad again, wrecking and tearing at the back of the bus. “We got to Limavady and he came to me and said, ‘I want my drink’ and I said ‘you’re not getting it, you didn’t behave yourself.’ “He drew out and he hit me and knocked the glasses off me. He had long hair and I managed to grab him, and the next thing was he landed out onto the street. “I looked and the police were sitting in the Landrover. I could see them coming and I thought ‘Jesus I’m in bother.’ “He got up and ran and the policemen chased him. The two cops came down then and askedI was alright andI wanted to press charges. “I said ‘naw you’re alright’ and they said, ‘you did a brave job with him anyway’ and I never heard another word about it.” Despite the odd bit of trouble here and there, Colm is full of praise for the Slaughtneil clubmen who kept things under control. “All the boys that were looking after the disco were pioneers. They were great clubmen and they were never short,” he said. “Even when the younger boys that were going to the disco in the early days, when they got past it they were doing their bit at it too. “It gave them a serious name in those early days, and it put a bit of a push on the other clubs about the county to make their club as financially strong as Slaughtneil.” With his parents’ house being in Maghera, Colm was able to take advantage by dropping in for a visit while the hundreds of teenagers he transported were dancing just a few miles out the road. “Every Friday night I would have reversed the bus up to the side of the house and watched The Late, Late Show with my mother and father,” he said. “You had to rush back to get up before the parents came up in cars. It would take you  or  minutes to get out, but it was well-marshalled and it was a good time for the weans.” The bus drivers who braved the roads leading to Slaughtneil disco kept teenagers dancing in the South Derry hills. They became the trustworthy ferrymen of teenage dreams.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil disco. The Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. googletag.cmd.push “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. googletag.cmd.push “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us. “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Brian Mullins was at the helm when the Anglo Celt Cup last ed to the Oakleaf County in  and Michael McMullan spoke to him about his three years in charge. Reigning champions Dublin led the  All-Ireland semi-final by four points when a loose ball plodded around the middle of Croke Park. Brian Mullins ghosted from behind a ruck. He pulled on the ball with a measured conviction. The Dublin midfielders dink hovered towards Pat Gogarty, under the shadow of the Hogan Stand. His diagonal pass found the unmarked Tony Hanahoe with the Canal End goal in his sights. After dodging two token Derry tackles, Hanahoe roofed the ball unceremoniously to the top corner. John Sommers didnt have a prayer. googletag.cmd.push It was Mullins first taste of Derry. Anthony McGurk was in the opposing corner, on a team managed by the late Frankie Kearney. The three men would unite  years later to take charge of a turbulent Oakleaf ship, following the sacking of Eamonn Coleman and the player strikes that followed Mickey Morans appointment in . Brian tiptoed onto the management circuit, like he did into Dublins team of the seventies. As an -year-old, a son of Kerry and Clare parents, he was selling programmes at the  All-Ireland final, before being called in by supremo Kevin Heffernan the following season, by chance almost. googletag.cmd.push In a bid to bolster his midfield options, Heffo got tipped off about an upcoming Fran Ryder and headed to Belfast for a Thomond Colleges Sigerson Cup clash against the Ranch. It was, however, Ryders colleague and the managers clubmate Mullins who caught the eye. He brought his selectors to watch Brian in action for St Vincents in an U championship clash, where he battered through the opposition defence before scoring a last gasp winning goal. That was it, Mullins was in. There was still a hiccup and he almost missed the All-Ireland final win over Galway. A chipped bone in his foot, sustained in Dublin U action, had Mullins laid up in the Mater hospital, with less than a month to the September showpiece. Heffernan and the chief surgeon had a dference of opinion on Mullins fitness, before the Dubs boss got his way. “A decade in medical school didnt please Kevin,” commented Dublin player Dr Pat ONeill, who was also working in the Mater at the time, in Tom Humphries Dublin v Kerry book. Mullins secured the first of four Celtic Crosses, matching his uncle Bill Casey of Kerry. His career also saw him lose five further finals – all to the Kingdom – and coast to club All-Ireland glory. Heffo, according to Mullins, was a big influence on their squad during that era. “I would have learned a lot from him and hopefully carried those lessons into my own operation,” he offers. “I have been lucky during my late teens and early s...I picked up a lot of what he was about.” In the summer of , Mullins career and le flashed before him in a car crash, on his way from a holiday in Wexford to training in Dublin. He broke his leg and suffered severe head injuries. A testament to his toughness was shaking off a career-threatening injury, thanks to help from Irish Olympian Eamon Coghlan. Mullins restored the muscle in his legs and played in a further three All-Ireland finals, winning one in , a game where he was one of three Dublin players dismissed. Brian was made captain for the  season, but could only look on as Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute delivered a rousing acceptance speech as Gaeilgeafter lting the Sam. It was his last time in the Dublin jersey and when Kevin Heffernan stepped away, he joined Sean Doherty and Robbie Kelleher as a three-man management team to succeed him. Mullins, currently the Director of Sport at UCD, was a qualied PE Teacher from University of Limerick, but never felt management would be something he would have tried his hand at. The trio left the post after a defeat by an emerging Meath team. “There were many other things going on in my le, between owning a business and teaching. Then I moved to Donegal in ,” Mullins points out. He had been running a fitness centre business with another Vins man, Mickey Whelan, he was playing with the club and teaching in Dublin. Mullins was appointed as Principal of Carndonagh Community School, where he lived for nine years and played a bit of club football for the local club. “It was the biggest school in Ireland,” he says. “The school used to compete in all levels at Ulster Schools competitions. There were clubs in all the town on the peninsula, there was a big catchment area.” His next county involvement would come from an unlikely corner. *** He cant put it down to an exact moment, when Derry came calling. Mullins was now rooted in Donegal and managing all aspects of school le was all-consuming. “When the Derry opportunity came up in , it wasnt something I was necessarily thinking of doing,” he recalls. “Managing a county team is something I wasnt preoccupied with,” he added, before giving it some consideration. “I ended up doing the job for three years,” Mullins added. “The squad was already in place, which included most,not all of the All-Ireland squad of .” Brian McGilligan and Tony Scullion would step away during his tenure, with Danny Quinn later taking on a coaching role after helping Harry Gribbinwith the U team. Enda Gormley did begin the   as a trainer. He felt a lethargy, which later transpired to be a blood problem. Once it cleared, Mullins coaxed Enda back to the playing . In the early days, Eugene Young trained the team, with Frankie Kearney and Anthony McGurk as selectors. “Anthony lived in Derry City, so I got in touch with him,” Mullins points out. “We were about the same age. I knew he had been heavily involved with Lavey and thatJohnny was playing. “I wouldnt have spoken to Anthony for  years before I got in contact. I wouldnt necessarily have kept in contact with players I had played against.” With his appointment two or three weeks before the start of the league, Mullins hadnt attended the club championship, having still been playing in Donegal with Carndonagh that summer. “Training went well all through the league. The players enjoyed the games and particularly the win over Donegal in the final,” came his early memories of his first season. Did he feel retaining the league title was a priority  “They had ambition,” he said of the squad. “They wanted to do well and they wanted to win the league in . It was indicative of their ability and their motivation to try and follow on from . “Some of them felt they took their eye off the ball in  and  and they wanted to pick up again.” During our phone conversation, Mullins comes across as a thinker. Every sentence is calm, to the point and absent of background noise. “Fergal McCusker, Anthony Tohill, Henryand Kieran McKeever were there and any amount of them were in their mid-s and felt they had a lot of football in them,” he adds. Reflecting on the litany of names, and with hindsight, winning the league was no surprise. The championship was a dferent kettle of fish he states. After a facile win over Armagh at home, they bowed out to Tyrone in Clones. “The wheels came off...from the high of winning the league final, to two months later being out of the championship and your effort to win an All-Ireland - which is what most teams set out for - was derailed.” Only the front door was in vogue back then, it was another year away from Sam and Derry were no closer. Mullins felt there were no mental scars from a second defeat to their rivals in as many years. “There is no dficulty when you are at that level,” Mullins points out, with a firm tone of voice. “You dont dwell on defeats...apart from aspects you can learn from. It is another effort and another year of doing better than the previous year.” After the  championship defeat, to Tyrones  men, Mullins went at the league in his first season with conviction. Restoring the winning habit was important. “There was some thinking that we peaked too early. In , we tried to put more into the championship.” They didnt qualy for the latter stages of the league and it took a comfortable replay win to see off Monaghan in the first round, to set up Derry versus Tyrone – for the third year in a row. Noel Donnelly thumped home an early goal but it was a  dawn. Joe Cassidy and Joe Brolly notched - between them, with the latter blowing kisses after he slid home his goal and Seamus Downey grabbed a second goal in a hammering of sorts. “We fell foul of Cavan in the final,” Mullins remembers. “In some ways, we thought we got some things right but, on the day, Cavan...they were that little bit ahead of us in terms of delivering on the pitch. We didnt do it.” Jason Reilly did a Ravenelli by pulling his jersey over his head in celebration to mark his th minute goal. Cavan were now ahead. Seconds later Gary McGill had the goal chance, but his shot went straight at goalkeeper Paul ODowd. In the end, Cavan prevailed by the narrowest of margins. Controversy surrounded the victory. They were given a point in the first half that should never have stood. Raymond Cunninghams shot went a foot to the right of the posts. It was something Mullins, surprisingly, didnt and doesnt buy into. “When you are on the sideline and you are involved in a match -the umpire puts up his flag and the referee tots it as a score, thats it, it is a point. “I dont dwell on it. You dwell on the fact you were beaten by a point and wonder where you might have missed scores yourself. “There was a point on the scoreboard, the record shows that and that wouldve been our view coming out of it. On any given day, anything can happen with the opposition that puts them that little bit ahead. It is only learning what you didnt do or what you didnt do enough of, to make sure you made up for it in some way.” *** If Brian Mullins first season was a rushed start, going into  offered more time to scour the county for new players. Clubs were sounded out and recommendations were gathered of the young and emerging talent. “You went with the management team to matches,” he points out. “You looked to see who you could take into the . I am thinking of the likes of Enda Muldoon.” The Ballinderry man was one of six players from the U All-Ireland winning squad to come into the senior scene under the Dublin man. He had handed Sean Marty Lockhart his debut against Kerry at Ballinascreen in the Dublin mans first season. David ONeill and Paul McFlynn came into the defence for , with Joe Cassidy up front and Johnny McBride playing in a number of roles across the middle third. “We would go into each year believing thatwe did all we could and put our best foot forward, the Derry squad would believe they were equal to or better than most in Ulster and , was no dferent” Mullins outlined of this third season. “We were beat by Tyrone in  and by Cavan in , by a very close score, so going into  – why wouldnt you believe. We were happy enough where we were.” Derry lost the league final to Offaly, before hitting three goals in a double scores win over Monaghan in the championship. A semi-final win over Armagh took Derry through to another final, this time a low-scoring scrap with Donegal. “It was fine margins and we were close to losing again in  but we managed to get over the line,” came Mullins initial thoughts of the game. Captain Kieran McKeever didnt give Manus Boyle a snf and Lockharts masterclass on Tony Boyle put him on his way to an all-star later in the year. Even with a man of the match performance from wing-back Paul McFlynn, it looked like a game that was going to squirm away from Derry once again. With  seconds of stoppage time gone and the sides level, McFlynn pounced on a shanked Eoin McCloskey kick-out. As the Loup man scrambled on the ground, Anthony Tohill came in support, before drilling a thunderous delivery over midfield. Substitute Geoffrey McGonigle gained possession. With two Donegal defenders converging, Geoff flicked the ball across to Joe Brolly, who sidestepped Tony Blake before finishing the winning goal. “The fact that Geoffrey was involved in the goal makes it look like a good a decision,” Mullins ponders. “But these things can be seen as going horribly wrong and they can go right.” He was only on the pitch five minutes, but it wasnt a premeditated substitution. “In any circumstances, when you pick your starting , a lot of the time you have subs and decisions to have them as subs or in the starting  is a narrow decision. “We knew Geoffrey had the ability and he wouldve been very close to starting the game and putting him in, we were hopeful and knew he was capable of making a contribution – its as simple as that.” In the semi-final, Derry were convincingly beaten by a Galway team who would again beat them at the penultimate stage in . “That was the end of my three years,” Mullins conceded, while heaping praise on the players, the board and the GAA families during his three seasons. “It was about motivating the players, which wasnt a really dficult thing. They were a great bunch of lads and I would have nothing but praise for them. “That is the thing about sport, there is no guarantee that just because you put in a big effort you are going to end up winning. It is swings and roundabouts, you take the defeats on the chin and you head on into the rest of your le. “I just felt it was time for a change of voice and a change of energy and a change of direction,” he states of his decision to step down. “I had other things, in terms of my work and family, that I needed to put a priority on, and I felt the Derry job needed somebody dferent,” he concluded. Mullins still has family in north Donegal and would sometimes catch up with some of the Derry players of that era. He was in Moyola for Derrys golf day in , to mark  years since winning Sam. And  years on, Mullins remains the last manager to deliver championship silver. The wait continues. RELATED - Mullins surprised at Derrys -year gap without an Ulster title. More...

Furlough scheme ‘offers a leline to many businesses’  WORKING HARD: A Seating Matters employee producing medical equipment at the company’s workshop CASE STUDY PROTECTIVE GEAR A COUNTY Derry company has been protecting health care workers by supplying high-end protective gear for intensive care units during the COVID- crisis. Seating Matters, based outside Ballykelly, has been able to use the Government’s furlough scheme to protect about a quarter of its -strong workforce, while also helping provide box shields to protect healthcare workers while they are ventilating patients googletag.cmd.push The family-owned company has specialised in creating chairs to provide comfort, postural support, pressure management and improve quality of le for disabled adults and children since . During the COVID- outbreak, however, the company has teamed up with medical experts and designers to create the box shields. Managing director Martin Tierney said: “We have been making clinical therapeutic chairs for hospitals and we are very close to the front line in that respect because a lot of our chairs are being used in intensive care and in COVID wards.” Seating Matters was established by Martin’s mother Martina, an occupational therapist who had identied a global demand for therapeutic chairs. googletag.cmd.push It now has  staff but Mr Tierney said it had to furlough a quarter of its staff. He said the government furlough scheme was a leline for many businesses. Mr Tierney said: “I’m grateful that we can keep moving forward because there are a lot of places that are stopped altogether. I’m just grateful that we are not in that boat.” The firm has strict social distancing and changed an office entrance in order to safeguard staff against coronavirus infection. ‘Critical to Scouts’ survival’  HELPING HAND: Scouts Scotland supports , volunteers and , young people CASE STUDY SCOUTS SCOTLAND SCOUTS SCOTLAND chief executive Katie Docherty says the Coronavirus Job Retention Schemehas been absolutely critical to the survival of Scouts Scotland as an organisation.

The organisation, which supports , volunteers and , young people in Scotland, has suffered a pound. million shortfall as a result. Ms Docherty said they had received some funding from the Scottish Government, but that furlough scheme is “the leline that’s keeping us going just now”. She said: “It’s the furlough scheme that’s allowed us to keep paying our staff whilst we have no income coming in. It’s been absolutely critical. We would have had to make most of our staff redundant otherwise.” The CJRS has been extended until the end of October by the UK Government in order to protect businesses and jobs across the country. Chancellor’s measures to safeguard firms and their staff  FINANCIAL HELP: Chancellor Rishi Sunak The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a range of measures for businesses and workers to protect them against the current economic emergency.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

In this weeks interview with the County Derry Post, the former Derry manager looks back on a tenure that saw him win a league and an Ulster title. He also played down the controversy surrounding Raymond Cunninghams point in the first-half of the  final, a game Cavan won by a point. Mullins has not had any involvement with Dublin since , when the three-man senior management team he was involved withstepped down and is the Director of Sport at UCD. googletag.cmd.push Since Mullins departure from Derry, the county have won two NFLtitles and were on the the cusp of the  All-Ireland final, until Matthew Clancys game-changing goal. Derry went toe to toe with the Dubs in , reached an Ulster final in  with brothers Eoin and Paddy Bradley on the injured list. “I am a bit surprised, given the tradition in the county and the capacity,” answered Mullins of his thoughts on the -year gap. “I know enough about Derry football over the years and it is quite competitive. You have the likes of St Pats Maghera at school and at club level, you have Slaughtneil doing so well. They are all yardsticks of how strong or otherwise the sport is.” googletag.cmd.push “I would have expected that Derry would have popped in there with a team worthy of winning a few of them at one time or a few years of once-off successes.” When asked of the Dublin success, Mullins doesnt claim any credit or kudos for the transformation. Occasionally, Dublin will book their development squad into the facilities at UCD, where is the Director of Sport, but they all have their own management teams. “I have not had any involvement with any Dublin senior, minor of U team since ,” Mullins outlines. “Jack McCaffery, Paul Mannion and others who attended UCD have been on the team but thats as far as it goes.” On the topic of Dublins five in a row, Mullins refers to the high standards that any All-Ireland team brings. He lists Kerry, Mayo and Tyrone as being on the champions coattails, with Dublins consistency and resilience being big factors in the five-in-a-row. “I still think there have been a number of All-Ireland finals in the past while that Dublin were within a hairs breath from losing, it is just that they found the resilience at vital moments that the opposition didnt have.” Donegal were the last Ulster team to win Sam and were close in . Down lost a final to Cork by a point  and Tyrone, with Mickey Hartes men also beaten by Dublin convincingly in . Mullins doesnt feel there is a lot of catching up needed, but Ulster teams need to reassess. “The inidual counties are well-capable of managing and maintaining an effort. In the s, there was Derry, Down and Donegal and eventually Armagh and Tyrone all succeeded to getting to the standard of what was required. “If they could do it in the s and early s, they might have to go back, as you might say, to a drawing board...but it shows they are well capable of doing it.” RELATED - Rory Gallagher feels Derry can take advantage of lockdown.

In time and when the Covid- outbreak is contained sufficiently, focus will sht on to step  which will be an extended YELLOW Phase when both outdoor and indoor sport activity would take place in larger groups, up to  people. The next progression would be to a GREEN phase which would lead to full training and competition across sports in line within general PHA guidelines that exist at the time, a re-opening of leisure centres and spectators able to attend live sporting events in restricted numbers. googletag.cmd.push Completion of each phase will represent a key milestone in the progression towards the resumption of sport and physical recreation in Northern Ireland.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Debbies love of poetry blossomed in recentyears after she lost a number of loved ones to suicide. googletag.cmd.push I started really writing due to tragedy, she said. I lost a few people to the Foyle and I wrote a poem about it A River of Tears which people really connected with. That is my favourite poem and one that resonates this week because of Mental Health Awareness Week. Although some of her poetry deals with dficult themes, many of the pieces have a thread of humour running through them. Theres a sensehumourin Creggan, said Debbie. I write about things that everyone goes through and that everyone relates to and I put in it words that people relate to. googletag.cmd.push Theres no pointin me sitting here writing out a poem with big snobby words People will say shes from Creggan, who does she think she is, Shakespere  Poems like Lockdown make light of a bad situation because the one thing we do have is our humour. It doesnt mention the NHS though, so Id like todo something on that next. And Id also like to do a poem for our postmen because they are as much frontline workers as anyone. Debbie shares her poetry on Facebook and has been approached in the past about publishing a collection of her work. If I write something and someone relates to it then thats great, she said, If it lts someones spirits thats enoughfor me really. If I ever did write a book I would do it for charity because then it would combine two things that I love doing- fundraising and poetry. I also love to encourage other writers.

Air Ambulance NI is a service we certainly never thought we would ever need but we will always be very grateful to the team who attended to Conor.ldquoWe are encouraging all our family, friends and the community to come along and get involved ndash itrsquoll be a challenge but a great day out.John added: ldquoPlease support this service and help ensure the HEMS is available for other families in the future should they need it.The challenge is taking place during the national Air Ambulance Month.Air Ambulance NI are asking people to register at airambulanceni.org upcoming-events to climb Slemish in Co Antrim on September , Cuilcagh in Co Fermanagh on September  and Slieve Donard on September .Kerry Anderson, Air Ambulance NI head of fundraising, said: ldquoFor the first time, a virtual challenge has been created for walkers to complete from the comfort of their own home.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time. To get one dish is big, to get two dishes to the banquet is major as itrsquos only happened twice before and never for someone from Northern Ireland.ldquoAlthough I think everyone was shocked that I didnrsquot get Champion of Champions. A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games. We had to do all our own prep, there was a delay in starting as guests arrived late due to Storm Ciara and there was a lot of things that went wrong, like the power going off, that wasnrsquot shown, said Alex.ldquoI joked with the other two guys you can just put the effort into one dish and can make sure its absolutely perfect but Irsquove got two to doldquoThe profile of the programme and the scale of the guests and how well known they were made it feel more pressurised.Ten years ago, Alex moved on to Deanes in Belfast after the Bucks Head, where he was working when they first received the Michelin star under Derek Creagh. He later moved to work with Gordon Ramsay at Claridgersquos, followed by Petrus in London, then had a spell in New Zealand before moving closer to home to the Clf House Hotel in Waterford.There are great expectations on what Alex will do next in his career but he doesnrsquot feel that a change will happen so soon considering the impact of the coronavirus lockdown has had on restaurants.ldquoA lot of people have said to me that I should open my own restaurant, but the industry is in dire straits at the moment so itrsquos hard to know what will happen, said Alex. ldquoOf course, I have ideas of what I would like to do, but Michael gives me a  for what I want to do which I appreciate.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-.

William Whitelaw, whose failure as secretary of state for Northern Ireland to sign the order to intern Gerry Adams led to last week’s Supreme Court ruling, was the very man who was bound to have concurred with the flight to London of Adams and Martin McGuinness in  to meet British officials. Interestingly Adams and McGuinness thereafter quickly climbed the heights of Sinn Fein. . William Whitelaw is reported to have discussed Father Chesney, the priest alleged to have played a role in the IRA Claudy bomb, with the Roman Catholic cardinal before Father Chesney was allowed to escape to Donegal and avoided arrest.. Mr Ringland’s claim of the fairness of British justice system, as evident he says in the Gerry Adams Supreme Court decision, seems to me to be at odds with his comment later “the unbalanced way the narrative of the Troubles is being reshaped in our courts”.. One of the greatest travesties of the judicial system was the release in the s by the then lord chief justice of all those convicted on supergrass evidence. The QC, now deceased, who represented most of the accused was an old friend of mine, and he made it clear to me that at the appeals he did not have to kick the door open for an acquittal. The political decision seemed to have been made, he told me.

In contrast with the countless victims of the IRA, who never enjoyed a right of appeal against the summary decision of the IRA to murder them, Adams benefits from appeal to the British courts whose judges the Provos brutally murdered. No right to le for IRA victims, but a right of appeal for Adams!Justice in any court this side of eternity is still denied for the vast majority of IRA victims. My thoughts are with those victims who will doubtless feel aggrieved at the failure of the state to fulfil its responsibility to them while facilitating Adams.Not only that but the taxpayer has footed the very substantial bill to allow him to use the British legal system.It is wrong, outrageous indeed, that innocent victims like those of the Hyde Park bombing had to fight a protracted battle to secure legal aid to pursue John Downey while Adams was gted free legal representation costing a sum of this magnitude.

Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street

disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon

must look at longer term investment to support the financial resilience of our councils so that we are resourced to deliver on strategies for bespoke economic recovery and community support.“Councils
