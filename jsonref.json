By the time Meghan had become a senior royal, the pair were still no closer than before the 2018. According to one source, Meghan was disappointed that they hadn\u0027t bonded, but was not losing sleep over it.    The book also details one awkward moment at Kensington Palace in 2017 when Kate went alone in her Range Rover while shopping - despite  the fact Meghan was also going to the same street. Though some aides claimed the sisters-in-law \u0027talked and texted regularly\u0027, they had barely spent any time together by the time of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding.  The book also reveals how Meghan regarded some commentary and tabloid stories as \u0027sexist\u0027 and \u0027prejudiced\u0027, with ambitious women of colour like her labelled \u0027demanding and aggressive\u0027.  A close friend of Meghan\u0027s told the authors: \u0027Duchess Different. That\u0027s what people have a problem with. She\u0027s the easiest person in the world to work with.

In recent months racism in some of the UK’s top institutions has come under scrutiny amid the worldwide protests following the killing of US citizen George Floyd and, in the UK, protests that led to the toppling of the statue of slave owner Edward Colston in Bristol.However, the report showed that many aspects of British life are still dominated by white leaders. There are no BAME chief constables in the UK’s police forces, only six BAME council leaders, one BAME trade union boss and no BAME permanent secretaries in the civil service.There were only two FTSE 100 chief executives from an ethnic minority and no BAME chief executives from the top UK financial institutions. At the UK’s top 61 law, accountancy and consultancy firms, only six chief executives or managing partners were from an ethnic minority.Trevor Phillips, Green Park’s chair and the former Equality and Human Rights Commission chair, highlighted that most of the rise was due to Boris Johnson appointing 10 ethnic minority government ministers. Phillips recently ended up having no role in an inquiry into Covid-19’s impact on minority ethnic people after his proposed involvement prompted condemnation over alleged Islamophobic comments.Raj Tulsiani, the chief executive of Green Park, said the report “demonstrates not only the disparity of power in the UK’s highest echelons, but also the total failure to address it despite three years of government-backed targets and ample institutional rhetoric about commitments to ersity and inclusion.”“Those in entrenched positions of power clearly need access to new perspectives. We need to let go of the myth of an achieved meritocracy and reform our working practices so that they are inclusive from start to finish.”• This article was corrected on 28 July 2020 to make clear that Trevor Phillips had no role in the inquiry into Covid-19’s impact on minority ethnic people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8857715a28193f1aadf322dad4d36450889488ce/0_120_4095_2458/master/4095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9811a61a7c0bb3feb166721d2680478","title":"boohoo review uk supply chain","story":"Retailer faced allegations that factories making its clothes in Leicester were paying workers below minimum wageThe online fashion retailer Boohoo has promised to “act decisively” on any recommendations made by lawyers probing its UK supply chain, after it faced allegations that factories making its clothes in Leicester were paying workers below the minimum wage – but has not committed to publishing the full report.The independent review is being led by Alison Levitt QC, the former head of law firm Mishcon de Reya’s white-collar crime unit, and on Tuesday the company said her full report would be ready by 15 September for the company to consider.That is four months earlier than expected and comes after investors – who have seen the value of their shares fall by a third in the wake of a Sunday Times article – pushed for a speedier resolution. The group said it would “provide an update on the findings of the report” alongside its half-year results, which are due a fortnight later on 30 September.The review’s purpose is to examine Boohoo’s “obligations and relevant duties of care in relation to the workforce in its Leicester supply chain”. Levitt is being assisted by a team of solicitors from TLT, a UK law firm, as well as two junior counsel. The methodology used, which will include a public call for evidence, is to be agreed by Levitt and TLT.The main objectives are to ascertain whether the allegations are well-founded and, if they are, look at how closely the company monitored its supply chain in Leicester and had knowledge of the allegations. It will also consider the group’s compliance with the relevant law and make recommendations for the company to act upon.While traditional high street clothing chains have struggled with the rise of online shopping, in less than 15 years Boohoo has gone from a three-employee operation to a business with sales of £1.2bn and a 5,000-strong workforce that ships millions of parcels a week. It now owns a stable of brands including PrettyLittleThing, Nasty Gal, Karen Millen and Warehouse.However, the company’s share price has fallen sharply since an undercover reporter found staff allegedly being paid as little as £3.50 an hour in the factory, even though the minimum wage in Britain for those aged 25 and over is £8.72.Brian Small, the Boohoo deputy chairman and senior independent director, said: “We are pleased to share the terms of reference for the upcoming independent review into our Leicester supply chain. We believe this demonstrates how seriously we, as a board, are treating the recent allegations into our supply chain.”He added: “The group is committed to delivering the highest standards of ethics, compliance and transparency.”Aneesha Sherman, an analyst at Bernstein, said: “Bringing the date forward is a positive for shareholders, creating a faster path towards getting some clarity and certainty on the magnitude of the problem, as well as outlining the steps that will be taken to resolve it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83d37d88d9a59b529dd3663b8c75e933428a84c2/0_207_4939_2964/master/4939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=516890e55796ccdcecb2a51587a21236","title":"greggs loss coronavirus sales social distancing","story":"Bakery chain unveils £65m loss amid fears sales slump will continue as long as social distancing is requiredThe bakery chain Greggs has said it will have to consider making job cuts after the government’s furlough scheme ends if demand does pick up to levels before the coronavirus pandemic damaged sales.Greggs has said sales will not recover to pre-pandemic levels for as long as social distancing rules are in place, but the bakery chain on Tuesday added it was “encouraged” by its performance since reopening.Greggs has limited its product range to bestsellers such as its vegan sausage roll in anticipation of lower sales, meaning about a quarter of its staff, concentrated in areas such as production and central operations, are still on furlough. The company’s statement said: “The continued use of the CJRS will be crucial in supporting jobs whilst demand recovers.”Whiteside said he would delay any decision on staffing “to the last possible moment so we get a better view”.“We want to give as much time as possible for demand to rise,” he said. “We employ people to serve customers ... It’s a question of activity really.”The £65.2m loss compares with a £36.7m profit at the same point last year.Greggs shops were closed from 23 March until it started reopening 800 stores on 18 June. Total sales in the 26 weeks to 27 June were £300.6m, compared with £546.3m in the previous year.“The broad appeal of the brand, which is not materially dependent on office-based workers, means we are less impacted by social distancing than many,” Greggs said. “The majority of our shops are located in towns and suburbs, or catchments that are generally accessed by car. However, we still expect sales to remain below normal for as long as social distancing is required.”The pandemic has also changed Greggs’s expansion plans. The chain had planned to open more than 100 new stores this year, but now only plans 60 openings, with the focus on locations accessible by car, where sales have been more resilient, rather than those dependent on public transport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f1c01b30971e03e48338b55591ab4fa1e32be01/0_145_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0baa4385e62b347c9dbdfbf569af4f2","title":"how much is a life worth northern irish community split over gold mining plans","story":"There’s gold in the Sperrin mountains – £3bn, to be precise – but local residents fiercely oppose developers’ plansPeter McKenna remembers the trickle of visitors who started panning for gold in the Sperrin mountains of County Tyrone in the 1970s. “We put them in the same bracket as the leprechauns and the ringforts, end of the rainbow type stuff.”It turned out there really was gold. But an attempt to start mining in the 1980s faltered – the Troubles were raging and authorities feared the IRA would steal any explosives brought into this corner of Northern Ireland.Now, with the Troubles a memory, a New York-based investment fund is planning to build a mine at Greencastle, a hamlet in the Sperrin mountains that sits atop what is by grade one of the world’s biggest unexcavated gold deposits, worth an estimated £3bn.McKenna, a gold sceptic no more, is a community relations manager for the mining company Dalradian Gold, and instead of leprechauns he envisages licences, drilling and jobs. “This is something that has world potential.”Its fate hangs in the balance. The Stormont government announced on 29 June a public inquiry into the application, saying it had received more than 40,000 representations, the vast majority objections.The proposed site at Greencastle is just one of a slew of applications to mine gold in the Dalradian supergroup, a 450-mile belt of rock ning Ireland and Scotland.A surge in global prices – hovering at $1,800 an ounce as investors seek a haven from turbulent markets – may further whet the appetite for Celtic gold on both sides of the North Channel.Commercial extraction of ore at the UK’s only operational gold mine at Cononish near Tyndrum is to start later this year. Cononish is doing geological surveys at two other nearby sites and has exploration licences for 13 parts of the southern Highlands.A second firm, Erris Resources, has begun test sampling at two sites south of Loch Tay in Perthshire that it says have “good prospects” for gold, silver and zinc. Those licences cover hundreds of square kilometres.Other companies have obtained gold prospecting licences for several counties in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, including a site in Clontibret, county Monaghan, said to hold about 500,000 ounces. It is 40 miles south of Greencastle.The Dalradian supergroup was becoming famous for untapped gold, said Richard Gray, the managing director of Scotgold Resources, which owns Cononish. “In the parlance of geologists, it’s elephant country.”The geological formation is named after the Dál Riata, a Gaelic kingdom credited with a golden age of influence in the sixth century. The prospect of mining companies ushering in a literal golden age has polarised opinion in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some welcome the promise of jobs and investment. Others, including conservationists and environmentalists, fear pollution and despoliation.Politicians and regulators face intense lobbying from both sides. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) is drafting its first mining and quarrying strategy which will cover the water and environmental pollution laws gold mines need to uphold.“We’re clear that environmental compliance is non-negotiable. Every Scottish business will comply with the law, and we’ll work to ensure as many as possible will go even further,” said Kenny Boag, Sepa’s head of strategic regulatory initiatives.Northern Ireland’s infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, said a public inquiry would “robustly scrutinise” the proposed mine at Greencastle.Battle lines have formed for the greatest prize in the Dalradian supergroup. On one side stands Orion Resource Partners, a US investment fund that owns Dalradian Resources, the Canadian parent company of Dalradian Gold.After spending £130m exploring the site it submitted an application for a mine and processing plant in 2017, later revising the application when it dropped plans to use cyanide. The company posits hundreds of jobs, a £750m lift to Northern Ireland’s economy – and clean practices to protect a designated area of outstanding natural beauty.“We’re a first world country with first world standards,” said McKenna. To extract an estimated 3.5m ounces of gold the mine would remove about 1,500 tonnes of rock per day and return about half of it, backfilling tunnels. “Compared internationally it’s a baby, engineers call it a boutique mine,” said McKenna.On the other side stands a group of residents who doubt the promised jobs and fear contamination of air, land and water. They staff the Greencastle People’s Office, a clutch of caravans near the proposed mine which serves as a command centre.“First they’ll blast with explosives and that’ll just be the start. It would wipe out this whole area, it would be toxic,” said John O’Donnell, who fishes trout in rivers.Martin Tracey, 46, a farmer, said damaging dust particles could reach schools and homes close to the site. “If that lodges in the lungs it doesn’t come out again. How much is a human life worth? It’s like someone coming into your house and attacking your family.”The protesters accuse Northern Ireland’s main political parties of ignoring them and question the independence of an inquiry that will sit before the planning appeals commission.The proposed mine has ided the community and sundered friendships, with each side accusing the other of surveillance and intimidation.Instead of gold, the mine may excavate a history of resistance to outsiders that dates back centuries, said Tracey. “We’re well prepared to fight these guys. The pedigree is there. I’m not going to lie down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1452d1a2f6bde8d99fb8759444ff976924f1f6f0/0_257_3009_1807/master/3009.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e971195103ad7c3d1bc407554aaad98","title":"ousted renault boss thierry bollore appointed new head of jaguar land rover","story":"Frenchman Thierry Bolloré to help steer UK’s biggest carmaker through industry’s worst crisis for decadesThe former boss of French car giant Renault has been appointed as chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, the UK’s biggest carmaker.Thierry Bolloré, who said he was the subject of a “strong-arm coup” when he was ousted as Renault chief executive in October 2019, will take over from Sir Ralf Speth as JLR’s CEO in September.Bolloré, 57, will be tasked with guiding JLR through the car industry’s worst crisis in living memory as consumer demand for new cars plummeted amid the global economic crisis prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.Natarajan Chandrasekaran, the chairman of India’s Tata conglomerate, which owns JLR, said: “I am delighted to welcome Thierry to Jaguar Land Rover. An established global business leader with a proven track record of implementing complex transformations, Thierry will bring a wealth of experience to one of the most revered positions in the industry.”Bolloré said: “Jaguar Land Rover is known around the world for its peerless brand heritage, exquisite design and deep engineering integrity. It will be my privilege to lead this fantastic company through what continues to be the most testing time of our generation.“Renowned for their passion and spirit, the people of Jaguar Land Rover are the driving force behind its success. I couldn’t be more excited to join the team continuing to shape the future of this iconic company.”Bolloré was ousted from Renault after less than a year in the top job as the French carmaker sought “a breath of fresh air” following the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, its former boss, in a huge financial scandal in Japan. Ghosn presided over the global alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi.At the time of his ousting in October, Bolloré, once a close associate of Carlos Ghosn, told the French business paper Les Echos that the “brutality and the totally unexpected nature of what is happening are staggering”.“Operationally, I do not see where the fault is,” he said. “This coup is very worrying”.Speth, 64, who has been CEO of JLR for a decade, will become non-executive vice chairman.Chandrasekaran said: “I want to thank Ralf for a decade of outstanding vision and leadership for Jaguar Land Rover and welcome him to his new non-executive position in addition to his existing role on the board of Tata Sons.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4e038ded3743e48a89037dbd386e382ad79f9fd/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d786189d1db721d79705e66e30e5faff","title":"mask easy smize pandemic chic coronavirus face covering","story":"From mask-denial to dubious pandemic chic, coronavirus face coverings have created new forms of social etiquetteWill the fact masks are now obligatory in shops in England finally – please God – mark the end of the mask culture wars? Will this spark a political and public commitment to sane and effective public health policies? Well, yes and no. On the one hand, it’s a relief that the government has finally listened to what the World Health Organization has been saying in increasingly desperate tones since early spring. On the other, complementary goggles seem to be required to make your way through this murky mire of regulation, social codes and libertarian posturing.People in England are now required to wear masks when collecting food from cafes and takeaways. Other countries haven’t needed to legislate, perhaps because they had higher levels of trust in their governments. We are also being encouraged to “eat out to help out” (it’s fitting that the Tories, never a party famed for their generosity, didn’t seem to grasp the sexual connotations of this slogan), but no restaurant or pub staff appear to be wearing masks, because they “don’t have to”. Supermarkets are saying that they won’t be enforcing the law. Workers are being encouraged back into offices – remember them? – but without any clear mask-wearing policy, even though anyone who has tried to do a spreadsheet to the dulcet tones of a colleague’s hacking cough knows that offices are hotbeds of disease. All of these places are indoors, but only some are regulated. By legislating for some, you imply it’s OK to go without in others.I popped down to my local when it opened and had a glance inside, but it was a mask-free zone, so I didn’t go in. It’s such a simple thing, putting on a mask. It says: “I care about your welfare, as well as my own, and do not want to infect you.” It is, ultimately, an act of kindness and generosity, underpinned – and I have to keep stressing this – by science. Developed by scientists, to whom we used to defer, back when we lived in the old, lucid world.The first time, I didn’t put my mask on properly. Like a member of the population of any country that doesn’t have an established culture of mask-wearing, my experience with face coverings was limited. I have never taken part in an Eyes Wide Shut-esque orgy, or been a black bloc anarchist, or held up a bank. No one has ever invited me to a masquerade ball or asked me to perform abdominal surgery, and I don’t own a house so have never sanded any floorboards. And yet, after that initial fumble, I somehow managed. It’s incredible what people can achieve, when they put their minds to it.Wearing a mask is easy, but it does require new forms of social etiquette. I have found myself becoming very expressive with my eyes, as though everyone with whom I now converse is a newborn baby, or a kitten. After wasting my teenage years bingeing on America’s Next Top Model, I finally have the opportunity to show off my “smize”. Time spent living in Italy has increased my repertoire of hand gestures, though I haven’t quite been brave enough to imitate a pal from Calabria’s favoured move, which was to mime rubbing his crotch while rolling his eyes at the merest irritation. It is no longer easy to make bitchy asides to one’s friends, and so passive aggressiveness has taken a big hit. So have impromptu conversations with strangers on trains, finally bringing the north into line with the miserable south.There’s a certain kind of person who refuses to wear a mask, and I hate to say it, but they are usually male (I’m joking, I’m an angry feminist, I love to say it). Don’t blame me, blame this study, which found that men were less inclined to wear them due to their being “shameful, not cool and a sign of weakness”, which is strange, because from the looks of these mask-denying types being cool never seemed to preoccupy them much before. Wearing a mask as a “chin guard” isn’t quite the sexy rebel-without-a-cause vibe you think it is, either. Weirdly, being a total baby isn’t all that alluring.The writer Andrew Male perhaps said it best when he wrote: “Men complaining about masks because they ‘feel unnaturaluncomfortable’, ‘ruin the experience’ (of social interaction) ‘probably don’t work anyway’ and ‘have taken the fun out of it’ (going to the shops). Just seems strangely familiar is all.” Doesn’t it just? Maybe what we really need is another Johnny Condom song, though the lyrics to this 90s awareness campaign ring true: “I protect you from the viruses, so why not try me on?” The skewed logic of those wearing masks in supermarkets but not in pubs is also familiar to those of us who believed the playground rumour that you couldn’t get pregnant standing up.And then there is fashion. I love fashion, but like any true acolyte, I also recognise that fashion is utterly ridiculous. Do I want this $45 Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana face mask? Yes I do, more than I can fully articulate (and not as much as I want this one that has The Scream by Edvard Munch – himself no stranger to feelings of paralysing terror, or respiratory diseases). But I am also disturbed by the way that late-stage capitalism has so fully embraced pandemic chic. I have always been a catastrophist, but I never envisaged my future Ballardian nightmare involving the marketing of luxury silk plague masks on Instagram. Even my anxious little prepper amygdala failed to make that jump.There’s something strangely dislocating about the Daily Mail’s sidebar of shame at the moment – it was never a landing pad for the well-adjusted, but now it’s reached the next level of barmy. “Leonardo DiCaprio, 45, is joined by glamorous girlfriend Camila Morrone, 23, as the couple enjoy a romantic al fresco dinner in LA” we are informed. The particulars of Morrone’s outfit are then described in great detail, with the exception of the matching mask that she is wearing in all the paparazzi photos. The pandemic, incidentally, provides women my age with an excellent opportunity to attempt to convince DiCaprio that we are under his apparent dating age threshold of 25, though we may require sunglasses as well as a mask. And probably a hat, as well.It’s a brave new world, this 2020 planet, and wearing a mask (sorry, “muzzle”) is really the least you can do for your fellow human beings. I’m a latent hippy and so would say that, of course – my mask is from Etsy and made from paisley fabric. But that doesn’t mean that the whole thing isn’t stressful, and sad, and above all deeply, deeply weird. Perhaps that’s why photographs of Ben Affleck smoking a cigarette under his own mask resonated with me so much. It’s a mood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f361e76a5d1fe02c1fdf3e1fa8607c8339ac85c2/0_70_3726_2235/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06be0cc7749718242154a5f64ac35ae4","title":"schoolgirls in england have you been informally excluded","story":"We’d like to hear from girls – or their parents – who have been excluded from a school in England via informal methods Girls are being informally excluded at a higher rate than boys from some schools in England, according to a study by not-for-profit group Social Finance.While boys are much more likely to be formally excluded, research shows girls are being excluded through moves to other schools or by leaving one school before the end of year 11 and not finishing their studies elsewhere.

The Galápagos marine reserve has one of the world’s greatest concentrations of shark species, including endangered whale and hammerhead varieties.Kakabadse said efforts would also be made to extend the exclusive economic zone to a 350-mile circumference around the islands which would join up with the Ecuadorian mainland’s economic zone, closing off a corridor of international waters in between the two where the Chinese fleet is currently located.Ecuador is also trying to establish a corridor of marine reserves between Pacific-facing neighbours Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia which would seal off important areas of marine ersity, Kakabadse said.Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, described the archipelago as “one of the richest fishing areas and a seedbed of life for the entire planet”, in a message on Twitter over the weekend.The Galápagos Islands are renowned for their unique plants and wildlife. Unesco describes the archipelago – visited by a quarter of a million tourists every year – as a “living museum and a showcase for evolution”.The 2017 incident he referred to was the capture by the Ecuadorean navy within the Galápagos marine reserve of a Chinese vessel. The Fu Yuan Yu Leng 999, part of an even larger fleet than the current one, was found to be carrying 300 tonnes of marine wildlife, mostly sharks.“We were appalled to discover that a massive Chinese industrial fishing fleet is currently off the Galápagos Islands,” said John Hourston, a spokesman for the Blue Planet Society, a NGO which campaigns against overfishing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f177b573a07215c74b184aa0d58c191268b619bf/0_171_5241_3145/master/5241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d1afa893b719dca0236626aee141244","title":"migratory river fish populations plunge 76 in past 50 years","story":"Decline in species such as salmon harms entire ecosystems and livelihoods, say researchersSpecies such as salmon, trout and giant catfish are vital not just to the rivers and lakes in which they breed or feed but to entire ecosystems. By swimming upstream, they transport nutrients from the oceans and provide food for many land animals, including bears, wolves and birds of prey.The migratory fish are also critical for the food security and livelihoods of millions of people around the world, while recreational fishing is worth billions of dollars a year. The causes of the decline are the hundreds of thousands of dams around the world, overfishing, the climate crisis and water pollution.“For migratory fish, there’s nothing worse than a dam,” said Zeb Hogan, at the University of Nevada and an author of the new report. He said the good news was that fish could return quickly: “Almost without exception, where dams have been removed, you see populations bounce back, often much more quickly than anyone anticipated.”A river restoration completed by the Penobscot River Restoration Trust partners in 2016 on the Penobscot River in Maine, US, led to river herring numbers growing from a few hundred to nearly 2m a year. The Dam Removal Europe coalition is working to free the continent’s rivers from more than 100,000 obsolete barriers. But thousands of hydropower dams are being built in other parts of the world.“Catastrophic losses in migratory fish populations show we cannot continue destroying our rivers,” said Arjan Berkhuysen, at the World Fish Migration Foundation. “This has immense consequences for people and nature across the globe. We can and need to act now before these keystone species are lost for good.”She said migratory fish were often the driving force in food chains because they transport nutrients: “If these fish populations continue to decline, there will be far-reaching consequences for many species which rely on them.”The report, led by Stefanie Deinet at the Zoological Society of London, examined data from 1,406 populations of 247 species. There are 1,100 species that must migrate to survive. The researchers said much more data was needed for regions outside Europe and North America to go beyond the general trends presented in the report.Migratory fish often use water temperature as a cue to start their journeys, but dams can significantly lower the temperature of river water. Global heating is also a factor, and can also change rainfall patterns. “So you get these very unnatural flows that can really have an impact on migratory fish,” said Hogan.“Not all dams are created equal,” he added. “Some dams are more environmentally damaging than others and how you place, design and operate them is important.” The damage to ecosystems and livelihoods must be taken more into account when building new dams, he said.Stephanie Januchowski-Hartley, at Swansea University, UK, said the millions of small obstructions to rivers, such as road culverts, also needed to be considered: “The cumulative effects of those are potentially greater than that of larger infrastructure, because of sheer numbers in the waterscape.”“We know why we’re losing these fish and we know what to do to save or restore them,” Hogan said. “It’s now a matter of public awareness and public will.” Stuart Orr, at WWF, said: “The world needs to implement an emergency recovery plan for the benefit of people and nature.”• This article was amended on 28 July 2020.

Nuclear fusion promises clean, unlimited power but, despite 60 years of research, it has yet to overcome the technical challenges of harnessing such extreme amounts of energy.Millions of components will be used to assemble the giant reactor, which will weigh 23,000 tonnes and the project is the most complex engineering endeavour in history. Almost 3,000 tonnes of superconducting magnets, some heavier than a jumbo jet, will be connected by 200km of superconducting cables, all kept at -269C by the world’s largest cryogenic plant.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, launched the assembly phase, alongside senior figures from Iter members, the EU, UK, China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the US. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, said: “I believe disruptive innovation will play a key role in addressing global issues including climate change and realising a sustainable carbon-free society.”“Enabling the exclusive use of clean energy will be a miracle for our planet,” said Bernard Bigot, Iter director-general. He said fusion, alongside renewable energy, would allow transport, buildings and industry to run on electricity.Nuclear fusion releases vast amounts of energy when heavy hydrogen atoms fuse together, but this requires a temperature of 150m C, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. The hydrogen fuel is obtained from seawater and just a few grammes is needed but huge magnets are needed to contain the plasma in doughnut-shaped vacuum chamber known as a tokamak.Like conventional nuclear fission reactors, the process itself does not produce climate-warming carbon dioxide but fusion reactors cannot meltdown and produce much less radioactive waste.The Iter project will be the first to achieve a “burning” or self-heating plasma and is expected to generate 10 times more heat than is put in, far more than any previous attempt. It will also use a significant amount of electrical energy when it is running, to power the magnets and scientific instruments, But it is intended to be a proof-of-concept of large-scale fusion, not a design for a future commercial reactor.Among the components being assembled is the 30-metre-diameter cryostat, manufactured by India, which surrounds the reactor and keeps it at the extremely low temperature required. One of the electromagnets, called the central solenoid and built by the US, will have the magnetic power to lift an aircraft carrier.There are numerous private-sector companies pursuing nuclear fusion via much smaller devices, including Tokamak Energy, based in the UK and which has raised £117m in investment. Its executive vice-chairman, David Kingham, said: “We welcome the progress at Iter which we see as a great scientific project and a major endorsement of tokamak devices.”“But we are convinced that faster progress is possible, driven by the need for more carbon-free energy and enabled by private investment, modular designs, new materials and advanced technologies,” he said. Iter engineers said their giant project is the size that proven technologies can deliver.Other nuclear fusion companies include Tri Alpha Energy, which harnesses particle accelerator technology and is working with Google, General Fusion, which uses a vortex of molten lead and lithium to contain the plasma and is backed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and First Light Fusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79eb10e9f989a5120f7955da24796c64e766ed6d/0_137_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=324aa89170baed813653712d7d75c071","title":"caught in the act camera traps snare rarest species in pictures","story":"Snow leopards, tapirs, oriental storks and many others feature in WWF’s new collection.

Inevitably the lineup has a slimmed-down feel, with many films delayed or held back, meaning there is little in the way of Venice’s traditional dose of Hollywood glamour.Festival director Alberto Barbera announced the main list of titles on Tuesday, which drew together films by the likes of Alex Gibney, Chloé Zhao and Luca Guadagnino. Zhao’s film, Nomadland, is arguably the most prized: following her indie hit The Rider, Zhao has adapted Jessica Bruder’s non-fiction account of older Americans forced on to the road by economic crisis, with Frances McDormand acting as producer as well as taking the lead role. In a sign of the pressures on film festivals, Nomadland will simultaneously premiere at the Toronto film festival, as well as subsequently filling the prestigious Centrepiece screening at the New York film festival.While American studio product is thin on the ground, a string of international auteurs have had their films selected, including veteran Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky, Israeli film-maker Amos Gitai, and previous Golden Lion winner Gianfranco Rosi. Call Me By Your Name director Guadagnino will bring Salvatore: Shoemaker of Dreams, a documentary about Salvatore Ferragamo, the founder of the celebrated shoe brand, and Gibney’s film is Crazy, Not Insane, a profile of Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a pioneering forensic psychiatrist and serial-killer investigator. Thunberg is the subject of another documentary, Greta, directed by Nathan Grossman.The British contribution is led by The Duke, directed by Notting Hill’s Roger Michell, which stars Jim Broadbent and Mirren in a story inspired by the real-life theft of Goya’s portrait of the Duke of Wellington from London’s National Gallery in 1961. Nowhere Special, which stars James Norton as a window-cleaner in Belfast and is directed by The Full Monty producer Uberto Pasolini, has been selected for the Orizzonti section, while Final Account, a decade-in-the-making documentary collecting testimonies from Holocaust perpetrators is screening out of competition after the death of its director Luke Holland.The festival is expected to go ahead with reduced numbers of delegates and social distancing protocols in place, as well as more screenings in outdoor venues. The associated film market will move online, as will the festival’s ambitious virtual reality competition, which has operated since 2017 on Venice’s Lazzaretto Vecchio island.In previous years, much criticism has been directed at Venice for its seeming inability to select significant numbers of female directors, with two included in the 2019 competition and one in 2018. This year, in contrast, Barbera has named eight films (out of 18) with female directors that will compete for the Golden Lion, including Zhao, French director Nicole Garcia and US-based Norwegian film-maker Mona Fastvold.The festival is also due to give life achievement Golden Lions to veteran Hong Kong actor-director Ann Hui and British actor Tilda Swinton, while Cate Blanchett has been installed as competition jury president.The Venice film festival runs from 2-12 September.CompetitionIn Between Dying (dir: Hilal Baydarov)Le Sorelle Macaluso (dir: Emma Dante)The World to Come (dir: Mona Fastvold)Nuevo Orden (dir: Michel Franco)And Tomorrow the Entire World (dir: Julia von Heinz)Amants (Lovers) (dir: Nicole Garcia)Laila in Haifa (dir: Amos Gitai)Dear Comrades (dir: Andrei Konchalovsky)Wife of a Spy (dir: Kiyoshi Kurosawa)Sun Children (dir: Majid Majidi)Pieces of a Woman (dir: Kornél Mundruczó)Miss Marx (dir: Susanna Nicchiarelli)Padre Nostro (dir: Claudio Noce)Notturno (dir: Gianfranco Rosi)Never Gonna Snow Again (dirs: Małgorzata Szumowska, Michał Englert)The Disciple (dir: Chaitanya Tamhane)Quo Vadis, Aida?

Headteachers explain how it’s doneWhen it became apparent that the school lockdown was imminent, principal Vicki Redhead and her team at Bishop Creighton academy, a primary school in Peterborough, wrestled with a tricky issue. How can you make online-only learning as safe as possible? They came up with a simple solution. The devices they used at school were already set up and locked down. Why not just let children take those school devices home?“Otherwise, those devices – which were bought for the benefit of the children – were just going to sit in a cupboard,” she says. “Luckily, we had already made the decision that every child should have their own device. You’d never ask a child to share an exercise book.”Today’s tech makes it much simpler to make those tweaks – and schools which had been exploring its possibilities before the lockdown have already considered many of the big questions around online safety. Choosing devices that can be rolled out with ease is a key consideration in reducing IT complexity. At University Technical College (UTC) Reading in Berkshire, pupils had already received training on professional behaviour both face-to-face and online. “They know what’s right and what’s wrong, and the consequences of doing something that is outside what we would consider professional,” says principal Jon Nicholls. “And they get it. We have close ties with industry, and our students understand professional boundaries.”However, a secure platform is also crucial. UTC Reading’s Microsoft Teams package has considerable functionality for keeping both students and staff safe online. All student data is held securely. Only invited students can attend classes – nobody else can join. Teachers can invite students into small groups for additional support work without other students being aware. Another teacher or learning support staff member is always online to actively monitor student chat. And lessons are recorded and stored – including any chat – so they can be checked if any concerns are raised by staff or students.Choosing the correct platform can also help to solve the problem of device access. There has been an explosion of cloud-based learning platforms and tools in the education sector that are designed to be used solely in a web browser, says Brendan Tapping, chief executive officer at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust, a multi-academy trust that serves south Tyneside, Sunderland and east Durham.“This has overcome many of the hurdles that students would have faced when trying to complete work from home. The cloud-based learning platforms allow students to complete their homework anytime, anywhere from almost any device, including their own mobile phones,” he says.These platforms are also key to allowing staff to easily communicate, collaborate and share learning resources, tips and strategies, helping to replicate face-to-face staffroom discussions and prevent teachers themselves from feeling isolated.But although being online has its own risks, the biggest risk for a child is living in an environment where threats exist – and lockdown could mean more risk for them. How can schools keep track of them in an online-only environment? Again, they’re using established best practice combined with tech and the art of good communication.At Ribblesdale, the school’s online learning platform, Teams, logs everything – including how often a child logs on to the platform, which the school can then monitor. “If a child is not accessing any work, that’s the first potential warning that something is wrong,” says Cox. “But we won’t use technology if it’s not the most applicable way of safeguarding. We might simply decide to phone up a child if that’s the right thing to do.”Regular communication has also been paramount at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust. “All pupils and parents receive regular wellbeing phone calls from a familiar member of staff, with our most vulnerable pupils and parents or carers being spoken to on a daily basis,” says Tapping. “It’s key to ensuring our families feel fully supported and we can ensure we keep our community as safe as possible in their virtual learning world.”And as school leaders begin to contemplate what school life might look like in the future, Redhead is optimistic that the key to staying safe online is having that strong safeguarding culture embedded in the first place – and that hasn’t stopped in lockdown. “I’ve got 200-plus children accessing Teams, and nobody’s misbehaving!” she says. “Nobody’s using it inappropriately, and that’s not because I’m telling them not to do it – that’s around the culture in the school. We shouldn’t be afraid of tech. It’s where our children’s futures are going to be.”Five tips for online security1. Ensure staff are trained in online safety and recognise the security risk posed by phishing emails.2. Choose a cloud-based, secure online learning platform which allows recording of lessons and chats.3. Keep lines of communication with pupils and other agencies open – if necessary, just make a phone call.4. Encourage parents and pupils to use school devices which are already locked down, and loan them out if necessary.5. Think of tech as an enhancement to safeguarding, rather than a barrier to it.Interested in finding out more about safeguarding pupils online?

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

One of its All Bar One venues, in Liverpool, has received more than 500 applicants for a single bar staff role.Last week it emerged a restaurant in Manchester had nearly 1,000 applications for a receptionist post within 24 hours, while pubs in London have also pulled in hundreds of applicant despite offering very few jobs.The Institute for Employment Studies said inner city areas and former industrial towns were bearing the brunt of the unfolding jobs crisis, with an average of 20 benefit claimants for each job vacancy in these areas.London is the worst affected, amid a plunge in the number of people travelling to the centre of the capital for work, which has had a severe knock-on effect for retail, leisure and hospitality outlets in the city.The jobs thinktank said the London borough of Brent had been hardest hit, with almost 50 benefit claimants for every vacancy, up from just eight in March. Four of the ten worst-affected areas are London boroughs, while places outside of the capital such as South Tyneside, Bolsover, Merthyr Tydfil and Tameside in Greater Manchester were also among the hardest hit.The number of people applying for jobs has started to rise over recent weeks as lockdown measures are eased and people start trying to return to life as close to normal as possible. Firms are however looking to bring back furloughed staff first before taking on any new applicants. Growing numbers of companies are also making swingeing job cuts amid a sharp downturn in demand for goods and services triggered by the pandemic.Young people leaving education this summer will also be hit hard by the crisis, with more than 100 graduates competing for every job requiring a university qualification, according to the job search site Adzuna.Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said he expected unemployment to mount further in the toughest jobs market for a generation.“At least 1 million more people are on out of work benefits who don’t have incomes, and who are looking for work as the economy reopens. So we have double whammy: many more people looking for work and very few jobs being advertised,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a88bb84a39e7e3d669803c54b3c842dba36ddf8/0_1743_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=453824827815fcf6bb1ab3ece56ceb36","title":"recruiters inundated coronavirus toll job market employment","story":"Jobseekers face challenge this summer as number in paid employment falls by 650,000 As the coronavirus crisis takes its toll on the UK labour market, the hunt for jobs has intensified. Last week, a Manchester restaurant said it had received nearly 1,000 applications for a receptionist post within 24 hours, reflecting the pressure that the jobs market is under. Paid employment in Britain has fallen almost 650,000 employees since March, which has left some businesses inundated with applications.‘It’s frightening that so many people in the industry are out of work’One front-of-house position, paying £10-12 an hour, had more than 400 applications, compared with 40 in February, and 200 people applied to a full-time barista role at the same hourly rate, up from just 25 people at the start of the year.“We’re delighted to have such experienced candidates coming to us for jobs,” says general manager Victoria Sheppard, who has received applications from “really prestigious” hospitality backgrounds. “The downside is that it’s frightening so many people in the industry are out of work. You wish you could help more people.” Victoria expected an increase in applications due to the scale of recent job losses in the industry but says it is “tricky” to see overqualified candidates. “We were quite shocked to see people applying who were paid considerably more than we had advertised. We’re a mid-range, luxury hospitality company, but we’re not Michelin-starred.”‘I’ve not seen this volume of people applying for roles in over 20 years’“I’ve worked in recruitment since 1998 and I’ve never seen this volume of people applying for roles,” says Adam Jennings, director of JMF Associates, a recruitment company based in Beckenham, south-east London, that specialises in accounting and finance.“I’ve seen applications from people earning six figures who are willing to drop to £50,000 or £60,000 as they’ve lost jobs in hotel management, retail or the arts and leisure sector,” he says. ”It’s really tough, and it’s likely to get worse before we see any improvement.”‘There’s a different calibre of applicants applying’The Oxfordshire-based Evergreen Agency has received a 10-fold increase in the number of applications for its digital marketing roles since March.“We’d normally get half a dozen good applicants for a role,” says the managing director, Aaron Rudman-Hawkins. Not only has the digital marketing agency received 70 to 80 applications for recent postings in roles such as digital PR, but the quality of applicants has increased too. “It’s rich pickings,” says Rudman-Hawkins. “There’s a lot of talent out there – fantastic people with great skills sets. There’s a different calibre of applicants applying, which is great.”Its location might also be a factor. People might be more reluctant, because of the pandemic, to commute by public transport to London, says Rudman-Hawkins. ‘I can see my mental health declining massively’Ellie, based in Devon, has applied for 100 jobs since she was made redundant from a food service company the day before lockdown. She had been in the job for less than a month but with cafes and pubs closing, the business went downhill “really rapidly”. Ineligible for the government’s furlough scheme Ellie, 25, found herself out of work for the first time.“I had a good few weeks of being really down and depressed. I didn’t have the strength to job hunt,” says Ellie. She eventually landed a temporary contract with a call centre in May but knows that the work could end at any time. “It’s really stressful not knowing if I could be let go tomorrow,” she says.In the meantime, she has applied for all manner of permanent jobs – in pubs, restaurants, supermarkets, other call centres and offices – but is yet to get an interview.“I don’t think employers want people my age because we get a higher rate of pay,” she says, referring to the national living wage bands that rise to £8.72 an hour over the age of 25. “Even random pub jobs get 100 to 200 applicants … I don’t stand a chance.”“I’m worried for my future. I don’t know how long this is going to go on for. I’m really anxious and depressed all of the time,” says Ellie. “I can see my mental health declining massively, not getting out of bed in the morning. I expect it’s going to be really hard.”Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow  Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02eeb2913648cb3e17835016b96718c5177f0987/0_145_4368_2622/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26be1d3db2dd42244ea08234df431bee","title":"we are the ae of law the first uk law centre for poor people turns 50","story":"Austerity cuts to legal aid may have restricted North Kensington’s resources, but they haven’t crushed its spiritIn a basement office under the shadow of Grenfell Tower in west London – where discoloured water drips from the ceiling into a plastic bin – lawyers and caseworkers are this month celebrating the 50th anniversary of the UK’s first law centre.Established in July 1970, North Kensington Law Centre pioneered a social justice movement aimed at making the law accessible to everyone. Austerity cuts to legal aid may have restricted its resources but they have not crushed its spirit.Peter Kandler, a solicitor now aged 85, was the driving force behind its creation. The original office was in an old butcher’s shop on Golborne Road, a street at the top of Portobello Market in west London, now adorned with fashion outlets.“Meat hooks were still on the wall when we moved in,” recalled Kandler, brimming with reminiscences. “In those days, lawyers were people in suits you were respectful to. We didn’t get anyone through the door for the first day or two.“Then I put our newspaper cuttings in the window: the Sun had written ‘Poor Law in a Butcher’s Shop’. People realised we were proper lawyers and started coming in droves. We saw more than 200 in the first three weeks.”The initiative derived from radical ideas Kandler imbibed at the Partisan Coffee House in Soho, then the cultural centre of the New Left. Having begun his legal career in a firm that specialised in probates and trusts, it was for him a “political awakening”.By the late 1960s, Kandler was running advice stalls for campaign groups and helping Notting Hill residents resist eviction from exploitative landlords like the notorious Peter Rachman. “He offered us three houses at one stage to lay off him,” Kandler remembers.Among those involved were Michael Zander, formerly professor of law at the LSE and for many years the ’s legal affairs correspondent, and Lord Tony Gifford QC, one of the most prominent advocates of his generation. Zander had returned from studying law centres in the US.Kandler was one of the first solicitors who insisted on going into police stations to meet clients in an era where, he said, it was common for officers to beat confessions out of suspects – before codes under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 came into force.“Not only did the police beat you up, they also charged you with assault back then,” Kandler recalls. On one occasion, he says, he secured a client bail by instructing him to show the stipendiary magistrate bruises on his arm, face and chest.North Kensington’s success was copied widely. At the peak in the 2000s there were more than 70 law centres in the UK now, following a decade of austerity cuts, there are about 40.Housing cases, funded by legal aid for those who could not afford an expensive lawyer, remain an area of specialism. The others are immigration and asylum, welfare benefits, employment and criminal defence cases.The director is Annie Campbell Viswanathan. Her obsession, she confesses, is money – trying to secure sufficient funds to keep the law centre running. A significant portion of her time is spent navigating her way through the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the Legal Aid Agency. Immigration cases, for example, on average cost about £8,000 to run, she estimates, but usually only generate about £5,000 in legal aid payments.The failure to lift qualifying income thresholds for entitlement to legal aid for decades means that fewer and fewer people qualify for help. Many seeking help are turned away  or charged. Like other cash-strapped law centres, North Kensington has itself begun to charge for some immigration work and settlements in employment cases as a means of generating additional income. Last year it brought in £15,000 through charging those who did not qualify for legal aid.The more bureaucratic society becomes, the more important it is to be able to challenge decisions, Campbell Viswanathan believes. For example, the list of evidence required for Windrush compensation claims is a severe deterrent. “Some you have to prove to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt, others on the balance of probabilities. How is an ordinary person meant to manage that?”When she arrived in 2018, she says the centre was at risk of closure partially due to cuts imposed by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, which drastically restricted the scope of legal aid, and partially because the Grenfell Tower disaster consumed so much time but resulted in few adequately funded cases.As legal aid spending has been slashed and councils’ budgets squeezed in the last decade, law centres have had to seek more and more erse sources from grant-giving organisations to survive.For years the law centre has provided legal observers for the nearby Notting Hill carnival. Since the Grenfell Tower fire, it has been supporting victims’ families – helping with visas and immigration advice. A few families are still in temporary accommodation.Holly Stow, a young paralegal who has just finished her law degree, is leading the centre’s Windrush project, seeking compensation for those affected by the government’s hostile-environment policies. Because they could not prove their nationality status, people who came to Britain decades ago lost jobs, were evicted and were robbed of opportunities they would have otherwise enjoyed. Stow is already handling 35 claims including some brought by those who were deported.Covid-19 has meant the law centre’s half-century celebrations have been delayed until next year, although an online party was held this month. The pandemic also delivered £60,000 in one-off emergency funding from the Ministry of Justice that recognises the importance of law centres for those most in need.The law centre says many of its more vulnerable clients are unhappy working online and feel digitally excluded, so it is gradually reopening for face-to-face consultations.A further consequence of coronavirus is a massive backlog in housing cases. Evictions were suspended during lockdown but there are fears that there will be a surge of litigation. Campbell Viswanathan is trying to recruit another housing solicitor.“If you don’t have meaningful access to law, you don’t have democracy,” she says. “It’s simply lip service if the only people who can use the law are rich people.“Law centres have a really important democratic function – holding government to account. We are the A\u0026ampE of law. We are the people who pitch up when a crisis has occurred.”• 17 July 1970: North Kensington Law Centre opens for business in Golborne Road, west London.• 1975: Given government funding to keep it out of financial difficulties.• 1981: Fire at Clanricarde Gardens in nearby Notting Hill killed eight migrant workers.

Now the actor is playing the first black woman to seek the US presidency – and rejecting suggestions she gets a ‘Hollywood smile’Shirley Chisholm was a woman of many firsts. She was the first black woman elected to Congress, the first black candidate to seek the presidency, and the first woman, full-stop, to participate in a US presidential debate. She introduced more than 50 pieces of legislation, most championing racial, economic and gender equality, and is often credited as paving the way for Barack Obama. In doing so, she occupied a space that many black women recognise: the solitary seat as the only such face at the table.Uzo Aduba, who plays Chisholm in the acclaimed new FX series Mrs America, says that this was a key factor in bringing this formidable politician to life. “That feeling of being the ‘only’,” she says, speaking via Zoom with a warm smile on her face. “It was important to get that right.”It’s certainly something Aduba can relate to. The 39-year-old made history in 2015 as the first female actor to win both a drama and comedy Emmy for the same role – the part of Suzanne “Crazy Eyes” Warren in Orange Is the New Black. “It was an honour to represent Chisholm,” she says, “because she’s not often portrayed. I just wanted to get her humanity.”The humanity of the much-mythologised feminists of the 1970s is a central part of the series, which spotlights the aims and the internal struggles of the activists who fought to pass the Equal Rights Amendment – as well as the conservatives who opposed it, led by staunch anti-feminist Phyllis Schlafly. A lauded ensemble cast boasts Hollywood giants and household names: Cate Blanchett as Schlafly, Rose Byrne as Gloria Steinem and Tracey Ullman as Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique.It’s the third episode of Mrs America that focuses on lesser-known congresswoman Chisholm’s failed bid for the presidential nomination at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. With historical figures being increasingly scrutinised and recontextualised in the wake of the George Floyd protests and the removal of various Confederate symbols, Aduba believes it is important to keep a level head with what may be more heroic figures, and not take a rose-tinted view.“Whether in the UK or the US,” she says, “revisionist history can be very powerful in completely erasing someone’s imperfections and faults. It’s worth examining the shortcomings of our feminist heroes. That doesn’t make what they did within the movement less important. It just recognises where their blind spots were and encourages us to know and do better.”Chisholm is the latest in a long line of strong female roles for Aduba. Last year, she starred in Miss Virginia, a biopic about Virginia Walden Ford, a single mother who fought for the creation of a school scholarship programme for low-income students in the early 2000s. Aduba first came to prominence via her critically acclaimed role as Warren in Orange Is the New Black, a character who started out as comic relief and, with time and skill, became increasingly layered and complex. Like Mrs America, Orange had a solid female ensemble cast and several women behind the scenes.It’s a constant theme in Aduba’s life as well as her career: her mother, who emigrated from Nigeria to Boston, was “the foundation” of her portrayal of Chisholm, who was born in New York but went to live with her grandmother in Barbados at the age of five. “There was a scene where Shirley was talking about growing up in the West Indies,” recalls Aduba. “It said almost verbatim what my mother used to say. She would say, ‘It wasn’t until I moved to America that I discovered there was something wrong with being black.’”In this world, she would find herself under pressure to change her name or her appearance. For example, in many African cultures, a gap tooth – such as the one she has – is considered a sign of beauty or wisdom, but it didn’t fit in with the accepted definition of a “Hollywood smile”. Having spent years learning to love her teeth, the whole process had to start again when she began her career in showbiz. She mentions a meeting she had with an agent, who came to a show of hers hoping to work with her.“She’s like, ‘So what are we doing about that gap? Are we keeping it?’ As if we both had gaps, and we’re braiding our hair at a slumber party, trying to figure out if we’re going to call Tim tonight and ask him to the dance!” Aduba resolved to keep it, declined to work with the agent, and vowed never to bend to the arbitrary rules of her industry. “This business is so liquid,” she says. “To be shapeshifting, it’s like trying to catch the wind. You’re never gonna do it.”Indeed, with film slowly ersifying, difference is gradually being understood as an asset to storytelling. The intricacies of Chisholm’s Mrs America episode have been roundly praised by critics, which is partly down to its director, Amma Asante. In a recent interview, Aduba said Asante was likely the second woman of colour she’d worked with in a directorial capacity. White directors directing white actors depicting the stories of other white people – generally men – is the default. Black women in film rarely have the same experience, which made a marked difference in how Aduba depicted the “misogynoir” that Chisholm faced.“You can’t contextualise race and racism,” she says. “You have to have lived it to understand the feeling of it. So there’s not been some sort of substitution for Amma to understand – she doesn’t have to craft something, she just knows what I’m talking about because she is having the same experience as a black woman in the world. That was really nice.”Despite Chisholm being a founding member of the National Women’s Political Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus, both endorsed her white male opponent, George McGovern. Black male politicians pressured her to drop out of the race, with her longtime supporter Ron Dellums questioning whether she was “the candidate for blacks, or just for women”. These discussions around how black women can be let down within their own communities are not easily had. It is often seen as isive, tantamount to airing dirty laundry.These attacks on black men and women have become a global talking point. Protests have raged on across every US state and across the world, taking aim at every industry, Hollywood included. When I ask Aduba if she feels optimistic about the future, she says change is inevitable, in part due to the demonstrations but also because of a generation who are holding institutions to account in ways never seen before – at times without even needing to leave their rooms. In early June, she and her fellow Orange is the New Black castmates teamed up for an hour-long livestream about anti-racism and police reform.“That is what’s going to be the power shift,” she says. “That is going to bring the industry either willingly with us, or kicking and screaming. And it doesn’t matter how you come. Just as long as you come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1305010fbe259e2b7fc6e3a231b54ec822e0e7e/176_1141_5515_3309/master/5515.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6ac072d9e1350f0566baa34c44ddadf6","title":"berlin couple test positive for coronavirus after manchester visit","story":"Urgent track and trace operation under way after couple’s entire family infectedAn urgent track and trace operation is under way in Berlin after a couple tested positive for coronavirus after returning from a holiday to visit friends in Manchester.Fifty people who have had contact with the couple since their return are in quarantine, of whom 13 have so far tested positive for Covid-19. The Turkish couple, a 50-year-old taxi driver and his 45-year-old wife, arrived home on a Ryanair flight on 16 July. They were not diagnosed until six days after their return. The whole family is now infected, including the couple’s four children, aged nine to 21, and their grandmother.Gudrun Widders, an official at the local health office in the Berlin-Spandau district, told the Bild newspaper that no one in the family has required hospital treatment.She said that the health office had made repeated attempts to contact Ryanair so that the airline could contact other passengers who were on the plane, but that it has “so far had no feedback”.It is not known if Ryanair has reacted to the information and informed other passengers who were on the same flight as the couple.In a separate development, Germany’s foreign ministry advised holidaymakers on Tuesday not to travel to several Spanish regions, including Catalonia, that have seen coronavirus infection rates rise. “We currently advise against unnecessary tourist trips to the autonomous communities of Aragon, Catalonia and Navarre due to high infection numbers and local lockdowns,” the ministry said on its website.From Wednesday, Berlin airports will be offering free tests to people arriving in the city. On Monday, the state of Bavaria spearheaded the mass rollout of coronavirus testing facilities in the hope of reaching as many returning holidaymakers as possible. There is political consensus in Germany that obligatory testing makes sense amid a surge in the number of cases of the virus both at home and abroad.In the past eight days the German capital has reported 234 new coronavirus cases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/692ae140fee4ff039da0c577f384f214f1d7bc6b/0_0_2939_1763/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5bc4213cd3002c4175e5db4886b5b9c","title":"dads a dictator anything goes with mum how masks and distancing rules are dividing britain","story":"What do you do when your loved ones flout the law – or nag you about going out? As lockdown eases, attitudes to Covid-19 seem more polarised than everMichael, a 35-year-old university lecturer from Sheffield, barely speaks to his brother nowadays. For years, they had been drifting apart over political differences such as Brexit. “He hates my leftwing, liberal beliefs as much as I hate his way of looking at the world,” Michael says. “We used have a pint together occasionally, or go to a match.” But coronavirus was the final straw.Even before masks became mandatory in English shops, Michael always wore a face covering when he went shopping and did his best to maintain social distancing. His brother did not. “He says he doesn’t care if he gets Covid-19 and has flouted all the rules,” says Michael. “He loves the conspiracy theories that it came from a Wuhan lab, or that it doesn’t really exist. I am incensed by his selfish and unthinking approach.”Almost 150 miles to the south, the pandemic is putting another family under strain. Beth, 76, lives alone in Slough, Berkshire. “I have not seen friends as much as I would normally,” she says. “Once a week, I’ll walk with a friend. I meet others in our gardens. My son, however, thinks that I should not leave the house or meet with friends or do click-and-collect orders from shops. He thinks that he is looking after me. I think that he is being patronising and treating me as a senile idiot who is incapable of managing her own life.”Arguments such as these are very common, according to the family therapist Kitty Hagenbach, who has seen demand for her services soar during lockdown. “Even in ordinary times, a great amount of discord is from everybody thinking they know better, or how anybody else should live,” she says. With the stakes as high as they are, coronavirus has only made that worse.It does not help that mixed messages – on everything from masks to public transport – are coming out of Westminster or that different rules apply in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, high-profile refuseniks such as the journalist James Delingpole are posting photos or videos of themselves flouting the law about wearing masks.John, 46, a computer programmer from Somerset, says that social distancing has been a “big, troubling issue” for his family – in particular, trying to “rein in” his 16-year-old daughter’s urge to socialise. “My daughter’s friends seem to have far more freedom than her and have been going out for weeks,” he says. She understands that there must be limits on her freedom because her two brothers have health conditions that increase their vulnerability to Covid-19, but she struggles to understand why politicians would ease lockdown if it was not safe.“We try to explain that there are political reasons and that’s why we won’t be easing lockdown as quickly as the government is encouraging. But it isn’t a recipe for happiness – and a teenage mind is not always logical.”“Families aren’t used to being together all the time,” Hagenbach says. “And some children are quite frightened about what’s going on and what’s happened to the world. That doesn’t mean children should make inidual choices. Parents still need to take charge. But whether the science says you must stay in or you can go out, it all has an emotional and psychological impact.”Alexandra, a 31-year-old medical researcher, lives in Liverpool with her husband. They have been extra cautious, as her husband previously had heart disease. “Most of our family have been very respectful and observant. However, my dad and his wife just want to follow whatever Boris Johnson does as soon as any restrictions are lifted, they think we are hypochondriacs for maintaining stricter rules,” she says.“When our baby was born, family and friends came to the window to safely view her. My dad and his wife didn’t think it was worth the trip and decided to wait until Johnson lifted the restrictions. But we don’t trust him or his government.”Alexandra says that, as a scientist, she has been able to understand the data and research herself, but that her relatives don’t respect her wishes – “or if they do, they will do so reluctantly”.Similarly, Amina Minhas, 34, a nurse in London, has stuck to “science and fact” in her approach, which involves masks, visors and gloves, even when relatives disagree. “The rifts have arisen from different interpretations of easing of lockdown rules,” she says. “Some are continuing to socially distance for the foreseeable future and others listen to the advice of Johnson, and so believe that is an extreme view.” But despite the contention, Minhas says her family have remained close. “Lockdown has made everyone appreciate each other a lot more and has really demonstrated how precious life is and how quickly things can change.”Prof Edward Cartwright and John Rose from De Montfort University in Leicester have been studying attitudes toward lockdown. They have found that women are more likely to comply with rules than men, as are people aged 60 or older. This may be because older people know that they are more vulnerable to the virus. “But we didn’t see a young-person effect,” Cartwright says. “There’s a belief that young people were more likely to break the lockdown, but we didn’t see that in our research.”What they did find was that people whose relationships or health had been strained were more likely to break lockdown, as were those with a key worker in their home. “My take on that is that if you’re living with someone who is ‘breaking’ the rules anyway – because they’re a key worker – you’re as good as going out, too,” Cartwright says. Cartwright and Rose also noted an uptick in people saying they would break lockdown because they did not agree with it in the week that headlines were dominated by Dominic Cummings’s trip to Barnard Castle in County Durham.Andrew, 68, a gardener in Sussex, is old enough that you might expect him to worry about coronavirus. But he takes a fatalistic line. “Everybody’s got to die of something,” he says. He does not wear a mask and says that social distancing is a “load of nonsense. If people want to stay indoors and lock themselves up, then cool. But I don’t.” He believes that the response to Covid-19 is “overstated” and that the virus is “like flu”.He says that people are not seeing the bigger picture by focusing so much on Covid-19. “People need to think about mental health. Domestic violence is on the up. People aren’t going to the hospital to get treatment they really need because they’re afraid of the virus.”Why is he not afraid? “I keep a healthy lifestyle. I’m a vegetarian and I’m out gardening, so I get plenty of vitamin D. If I get the virus, so be it. But I am not intending to sort of crouch down and be timid.”For the most part, Andrew says his family and friends feel the same where they don’t, he is always respectful, understanding that they “do it with good reason”, such as having a health condition. He says he always keeps a distance when asked and in shops. “I’m a happy, easy-going person and I respect the different opinions this has brought to the surface.”Leyla El-Moudden, 38, takes the opposite approach to masks and distancing. She is the head of marketing and education at a health brand that specialises in nutritional supplements she works primarily with immunocompromised people. Although she was initially “blase” about wearing a mask because she was “maintaining a healthy immunity through nutrients, herbs and lifestyle”, she now wears one outside at all times, as do her husband and children. “My kids” – who are eight and four – “are proud of themselves and feel like they are being little superheroes.”What made her change her mind about masks? The way that Covid-19 struck “terror” into the hearts of some of her immunocompromised clients. “They are terrified to go outside and panic at the sight of unmasked people. I ordered masks the same week I spoke to three clients who either had cancer or were caring for someone with it. It really hit me, what immunocompromised people are going through. The mask is not just for us, but for others.”“Then there are my brothers, who have been weekend pub visitors my stepdad, who forgets a pandemic is happening and my stepmum, who berates everyone she sees outside on social media from her privileged position of a large house in the countryside.”Like many people, Katie says she is “somewhere in the middle. I have been really anxious and suffered the occasional panic attack, but also I believe that some evaluated risks are worth taking to see family.” But, in the end, faced with navigating all those familial differences, she says it is “easier just to stick to myself in my London flat”.For all the arguments about science and policy, there will be many more that come down to hurt feelings – and the subtext that relatives are using Covid-19 as an excuse. It is something that Reg, 35, a London-based art director, admits to. “I am strict when it suits me,” he says. “I love to say to my partner: ‘Oh, sorry, I would hang in the park with your friends, but I can’t because of Covid.’ Coronavirus is a great cover for misanthropic tendencies.”Is there a silver lining to lockdown and the unease over its relaxation? Yes, says Hagenbach. “We’re seeing people take more responsibility for the family life – children especially. A lot of modern kids are very spoiled,” she says. “But this has been an opportunity for people to come together, work together and realise that life takes a lot of effort. It’s down to how well families communicate with each other and how well they allow the other people to have their own independent feelings. You can’t all feel the same as a family.”Some names and details have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9660a8daebc4e73068d30f48b4c449ec044360cc/671_1065_3819_2291/master/3819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1131f96d74bfbc13d0348cf78125ce9","title":"hong kong property tycoon ivan ko pitches new city idea to ireland","story":"Ivan Ko hopes to find site between Dublin and Belfast to host 50,000 fellow HongkongersA property tycoon from Hong Kong wants to build a city in Ireland to host 50,000 emigrants from the semi-autonomous region in a plan he likens to the puritans arriving in America.Ivan Ko, founder of the Victoria Harbour Group (VHG), an international charter city investment company, hopes to find a 50 sq km site between Dublin and Belfast to create a new city, named Nextpolis, from scratch.Ko has pitched the plan, which would include schools that teach in Cantonese, to Irish officials, arguing it would fit the government’s stated desire to develop regions outside the capital.Of six locations under consideration the favourite was a site between Drogheda and Dundalk, near the border with Northern Ireland and within striking distance of Dublin airport, Ko told the Times, which first reported the story.“Hong Kong people are used to urban living. We want to go out at night, that sort of thing. So originally we thought the corridor between Dublin and Belfast might be suitable because of the infrastructure.“It’s also close to the Dublin airport. Hong Kong people are very used to flying to other countries to do business. But we are also open to other locations where maybe you’ll have a lot of tech companies or strong manufacturing, where the land may be even cheaper.”A department of foreign affairs spokesperson in Ireland confirmed there had been talks with Ko but appeared to pour cold water on the idea. “Following an initial approach in December 2019, the department had limited contact with the iniduals involved to provide helpful and realistic guidance about Ireland. Since providing this guidance there has been no further action taken by the department in this matter,” they said.Ko did not immediately respond to a  interview request on Tuesday.Earlier this week he told the Times he had drastically scaled down his original pitch – an autonomous city for 500,000 Hongkongers over 500 sq km – in response to the Irish feedback.“We have changed our strategy. We are now more flexible because we understand that every country has a different situation in terms of size and the ability to acquire land.”The envisaged city would be integrated into the host country, not autonomous, he said. “Now we are not thinking about anything like a separate border, different official languages and different political system.”Attractions included Ireland’s low population density and Brexit creating opportunities for its financial services sector, Ko said. He added he was considering three or four other countries, which he declined to name.Paddy Malone, a spokesperson for Dundalk’s chamber of commerce, said the M1 corridor region could host such a city. “We would be ideally located to facilitate this in that we have the infrastructure in place to cope with an expansion.”Settlers from Hong Kong would enjoy fast broadband, access to three airports and seven universities and be able to commute from Northern Ireland should they prefer to live in the UK, he said. “If it’s going to be accommodated in Ireland we are the prime location.”China’s recent imposition of national security laws on the island has prompted many Hongkongers to consider leaving. The British government has promised to provide assistance and relocation.In a Charter Cities Institute podcast Ko compared any such migration to those who sailed on the Mayflower to America in 1602. “We are in pursuit of freedom and democracy, which is a little bit similar to the pilgrims and the puritans who left Europe in pursuit of religious freedom.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6c27aed9c8f7eca66cdaa53b2e08dcc987ac7f9/0_0_3474_2084/master/3474.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1f92a600d0acdaf24b28e920c91328e9","title":"untouchables caste system us race martin luther king india","story":"We cannot fully understand the current upheavals, or almost any turning point in American history, without accounting for the human pyramid that is encrypted into us all: the caste system. By  Isabel WilkersonIn the winter of 1959, after leading the Montgomery bus boycott that arose from the arrest of Rosa Parks and before the trials and triumphs to come, Martin Luther King Jr and his wife, Coretta, landed in India, in the city then known as Bombay, to visit the land of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of nonviolent protest. They were covered in garlands upon arrival, and King told reporters: “To other countries, I may go as a tourist, but to India I come as a pilgrim.”He had long dreamed of going to India, and they stayed an entire month. King wanted to see for himself the place whose fight for freedom from British rule had inspired his fight for justice in America. He wanted to see the so-called “untouchables”, the lowest caste in the ancient Indian caste system, whom he had read about and had sympathy for, but who had still been left behind after India gained its independence the decade before.He discovered that people in India had been following the trials of his own oppressed people in the US, and knew of the bus boycott he had led. Wherever he went, the people on the streets of Bombay and Delhi crowded around him for an autograph. At one point in their trip, King and his wife journeyed to the southern tip of the country, to the city of Trivandrum in the state of Kerala, and visited with high-school students whose families had been untouchables. The principal made the introduction.“Young people,” he said, “I would like to present to you a fellow untouchable from the United States of America.”King was floored. He had not expected that term to be applied to him. He was, in fact, put off by it at first. He had flown in from another continent, and had dined with the prime minister. He did not see the connection, did not see what the Indian caste system had to do directly with him, did not immediately see why the lowest-caste people in India would view him, an American Negro and a distinguished visitor, as low-caste like themselves, see him as one of them. “For a moment,” he wrote, “I was a bit shocked and peeved that I would be referred to as an untouchable.”Then he began to think about the reality of the lives of the people he was fighting for – 20 million people, consigned to the lowest rank in the US for centuries, “still smothering in an airtight cage of poverty,” quarantined in isolated ghettoes, exiled in their own country.And he said to himself: “Yes, I am an untouchable, and every negro in the United States of America is an untouchable.” In that moment, he realised that the land of the free had imposed a caste system not unlike the caste system of India, and that he had lived under that system all of his life. It was what lay beneath the forces he was fighting in the US.What Martin Luther King Jr, recognised about his country that day had begun long before the ancestors of our ancestors had taken their first breaths. More than a century and a half before the American Revolution, a human hierarchy had evolved on the contested soil of what would become the United States – a concept of birthright, the temptation of entitled expansion that would set in motion what has been called the world’s oldest democracy and, with it, a ranking of human value and usage.It would twist the minds of men, as greed and self-reverence eclipsed human conscience and allowed the conquering men to take land and human bodies that they convinced themselves they had a right to. If they were to convert this wilderness and civilise it to their liking, they decided, they would need to conquer, enslave or remove the people already on it, and transport those they deemed lesser beings in order to tame and work the land to extract the wealth that lay in the rich soil and shorelines.To justify their plans, they took pre-existing notions of their own centrality, reinforced by their self-interested interpretation of the Bible, and created a hierarchy of who could do what, who could own what, who was on top and who was on the bottom and who was in between. There emerged a ladder of humanity, global in nature, as the upper-rung people would descend from Europe, with rungs inside that designation – the English Protestants at the very top, as their guns and resources would ultimately prevail in the bloody fight for North America. Everyone else would rank in descending order, on the basis of their proximity to those deemed most superior. The ranking would continue downward until one arrived at the very bottom: African captives transported in order to build the New World and to serve the victors for all their days, one generation after the next, for 12 generations.There developed a caste system, based upon what people looked like – an internalised ranking, unspoken, unnamed and unacknowledged by everyday citizens even as they go about their lives adhering to it and acting upon it subconsciously, to this day. Just as the studs and joists and beams that form the infrastructure of a building are not visible to those who live in it, so it is with caste. Its very invisibility is what gives it power and longevity. And though it may move in and out of consciousness, though it may flare and reassert itself in times of upheaval and recede in times of relative calm, it is an ever-present through-line in the country’s operation.A caste system is an artificial construction, a fixed and embedded ranking of human value that sets the presumed supremacy of one group against the presumed inferiority of others, on the basis of ancestry and often of immutable traits – traits that would be neutral in the abstract, but are ascribed life-and-death meaning in a hierarchy favouring the dominant caste whose forebears designed it. A caste system uses rigid, often arbitrary boundaries to keep the ranked groupings apart, distinct from one another and in their assigned places.Throughout human history, three caste systems have stood out. The tragically accelerated, chilling and officially vanquished caste system of Nazi Germany. The lingering, millennia-long caste system of India. And the shape-shifting, unspoken, race-based caste pyramid in the US. Each version relied on stigmatising those deemed inferior in order to justify the dehumanisation necessary to keep the lowest-ranked people at the bottom, and to rationalise the protocols of enforcement. A caste system endures because it is often justified as ine will, originating from a sacred text or the presumed laws of nature, reinforced throughout the culture and passed down through the generations.As we go about our daily lives, caste is the wordless usher in a darkened theatre, the flashlight cast down the aisles, guiding us to our assigned seats for a performance. The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power: which groups have it and which do not. It is about resources: which caste is seen as worthy of them, and which are not who gets to acquire and control them, and who does not. It is about respect, authority and assumptions of competence: who is accorded these, and who is not.As a means of assigning value to entire swaths of humankind, caste guides each of us, often beyond the reaches of our awareness. It embeds into our bones an unconscious ranking of human characteristics, and sets forth the rules, expectations and stereotypes that have been used to justify brutalities against entire groups within our species. In the American caste system, the signal of rank is what we call race, the ision of humans on the basis of their appearance. In the US, race is the primary tool and the visible decoy – the frontman – for caste.Race does the heavy lifting for a caste system that demands a means of human ision. If we have been trained to see humans in the language of race, then caste is the underlying grammar that we encode as children, as when learning our mother tongue. Caste, like grammar, becomes an invisible guide not only to how we speak, but to how we process information – the autonomic calculations that figure into a sentence without our having to think about it. Many of us have never taken a class in grammar, yet we know in our bones that a transitive verb takes an object, that a subject needs a predicate, and we know without thinking the difference between third-person singular and third-person plural. We might mention “race”, referring to people as black or white or Latino or Asian or indigenous, when what lies beneath each label is centuries of history, and the assigning of assumptions and values to physical features in a structure of human hierarchy.What people look like – or rather, the race they have been assigned, or are perceived to belong to – is the visible cue to their caste. It is the historic flashcard to the public, showing how people are to be treated, where they are expected to live, what kinds of positions they are expected to hold, whether they belong in this section of town or that seat in a boardroom, whether they should be expected to speak with authority on this or that subject, whether they will be administered pain relief in a hospital, whether their neighbourhood is likely to adjoin a toxic waste site or to have contaminated water flowing from their taps, whether they are more or less likely to survive childbirth in the most advanced nation in the world, whether they may be shot by authorities with impunity.Caste and race are neither synonymous nor mutually exclusive. They can and do coexist in the same culture, and serve to reinforce each other. Caste is the bones, race the skin. Race is what we can see, the physical traits that have been given arbitrary meaning and become shorthand for who a person is. Caste is the powerful infrastructure that holds each group in its place.Caste is fixed and rigid. Race is fluid and superficial, subject to periodic redefinition to meet the needs of the dominant caste in what is now the US. While the requirements to qualify as white have changed over the centuries, the fact of a dominant caste has remained constant from its inception – whoever fit the definition of white, at whatever point in history, was granted the legal rights and privileges of the dominant caste. Perhaps more critically and tragically, at the other end of the ladder, the subordinated caste, too, has been fixed from the beginning as the psychological floor beneath which all other castes cannot fall.Caste is not a term often applied to the US. It is considered the language of India or feudal Europe. But some anthropologists and scholars of race in the US have made use of the term for decades. Before the modern era, one of the earliest Americans to take up the idea of caste was the antebellum abolitionist and US senator Charles Sumner, as he fought against segregation in the north. “The separation of children in the Public Schools of Boston, on account of color or race,” he wrote, “is in the nature of Caste, and on this account is a violation of Equality.” He quoted a fellow humanitarian: “Caste makes distinctions among creatures where God has made none.”We cannot fully understand the current upheavals, or almost any turning point in American history, without accounting for the human pyramid that is encrypted into us all. The caste system, and the attempts to defend, uphold or abolish the hierarchy, underlay the American civil war and the civil rights movement a century later, and pervade the politics of the 21st-century US. Just as DNA is the code of instructions for cell development, caste has been the operating system for economic, political and social interaction in the US since the time of its gestation.In 1944, the Swedish social economist Gunnar Myrdal and a team of the most talented researchers in the country produced a 2,800-page, two-volume work that is still considered perhaps the most comprehensive study of race in the US. It was titled An American Dilemma. Myrdal’s investigation into race led him to the realisation that the most accurate term to describe the workings of US society was not race, but caste – and that perhaps it was the only term that really addressed what seemed a stubbornly fixed ranking of human value.The anthropologist Ashley Montagu was among the first to argue that race is a human invention – a social construct, not a biological one – and that in seeking to understand the isions and disparities in the US, we have typically fallen into the quicksand and mythology of race. “When we speak of ‘the race problem in America’,” he wrote in 1942, “what we really mean is the caste system and the problems which that caste system creates in America.”There was little confusion among some of the leading white supremacists of the previous century as to the connections between India’s caste system and that of the American south, where the purest legal caste system in the US existed. “A record of the desperate efforts of the conquering upper classes in India to preserve the purity of their blood persists to until this very day in their carefully regulated system of castes,” wrote Madison Grant, a popular eugenicist, in his 1916 bestseller, The Passing of the Great Race. “In our Southern States, Jim Crow cars and social discriminations have exactly the same purpose.”In 1913, Bhimrao Ambedkar, a man born to the bottom of India’s caste system, born an untouchable in the central provinces, arrived in New York City from Bombay. He came to the US to study economics as a graduate student at Columbia, focused on the differences between race, caste and class. Living just blocks from Harlem, he would see first-hand the condition of his counterparts in the US. He completed his thesis just as the film The Birth of a Nation – the incendiary homage to the Confederate south – premiered in New York in 1915. He would study further in London and return to India to become the foremost leader of the untouchables, and a pre-eminent intellectual who would help draft a new Indian constitution. He would work to dispense with the demeaning term “untouchable”. He rejected the term Harijans, which had been applied to them by Gandhi, to their minds patronisingly. He renamed his people Dalits, meaning “broken people” – which, due to the caste system, they were.It is hard to know what effect his exposure to the American social order had on him personally. But over the years, he paid close attention, as did many Dalits, to the subordinate caste in the US. Indians had long been aware of the plight of enslaved Africans, and of their descendants in the US. Back in the 1870s, after the end of slavery and during the brief window of black advancement known as Reconstruction, an Indian social reformer named Jyotirao Phule found inspiration in the US abolitionists. He expressed hope “that my countrymen may take their example as their guide”.Many decades later, in the summer of 1946, acting on news that black Americans were petitioning the United Nations for protection as minorities, Ambedkar reached out to the best-known African American intellectual of the day, WEB Du Bois. He told Du Bois that he had been a “student of the Negro problem” from across the oceans, and recognised their common fates.“There is so much similarity between the position of the Untouchables in India and of the position of the Negroes in America,” Ambedkar wrote to Du Bois, “that the study of the latter is not only natural but necessary.”Du Bois wrote back to Ambedkar to say that he was, indeed, familiar with him, and that he had “every sympathy with the Untouchables of India”. It had been Du Bois who seemed to have spoken for the marginalised in both countries as he identified the doubleconsciousness of their existence. And it was Du Bois who, decades before, had invoked an Indian concept in channelling the “bitter cry” of his people in the US: “Why did God make me an outcast and a stranger in mine own house?”I began investigating the American caste system after nearly two decades of examining the history of the Jim Crow south, the legal caste system that grew out of enslavement and lasted into the early 70s, within the lifes of many present-day Americans. I discovered that I was not writing about geography and relocation, but about the American caste system – an artificial hierarchy in which most everything that you could and could not do was based upon what you looked like, and which manifested itself north and south. I had been writing about a stigmatised people – 6 million of them – who were seeking freedom from the caste system in the south, only to discover that the hierarchy followed them wherever they went, much in the way that the shadow of caste (as I would soon discover) follows Indians in their own global diaspora.The American caste system began in the years after the arrival of the first Africans to the Colony of Virginia in the summer of 1619, as the colony sought to refine the distinctions of who could be enslaved for life and who could not. Over time, colonial laws granted English and Irish indentured servants greater privileges than the Africans who worked alongside them, and the Europeans were fused into a new identity – that of being categorised as white, the polar opposite of black. The historian Kenneth M Stampp called this assigning of race a “caste system, which ided those whose appearance enabled them to claim pure Caucasian ancestry from those whose appearance indicated that some or all of their forebears were Negroes”. Members of the Caucasian caste, as he called it, “believed in ‘white supremacy’, and maintained a high degree of caste solidarity to secure it”.While I was in the midst of my research, word of my inquiries spread to some Indian scholars of caste based in the US. They invited me to speak at an inaugural conference on caste and race at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, the town where WEB Du Bois was born and where his papers are kept.There, I told the audience that I had written a 600-page book about the Jim Crow era in the American south – the time of naked white supremacy – but that the word “racism” did not appear anywhere in the narrative. I told them that, after spending 15 years studying the topic and hearing the testimony of the survivors of the era, I had realised that the term was insufficient. “Caste” was the more accurate term, and I set out to them the reasons why. They were both stunned and heartened. The plates of Indian food kindly set before me at the reception thereafter sat cold due to the press of questions and the sharing that went on into the night.At a closing ceremony, the hosts presented to me a bronze-coloured bust of the patron saint of the low-born of India, Bhimrao Ambedkar, the Dalit leader who had written to Du Bois all those decades before.It felt like an initiation into a caste to which I had somehow always belonged. Over and over, they shared stories of what they had endured, and I responded in personal recognition, as if even to anticipate some particular turn or outcome. To their astonishment, I began to be able to tell who was high-born and who was low-born among the Indian people there, not from what they looked like, as one might in the US, but on the basis of the universal human response to hierarchy – in the case of an upper-caste person, an inescapable certitude in bearing, demeanour, behaviour and a visible expectation of centrality.On the way home, I was snapped back into my own world when airport security flagged my suitcase for inspection. The TSA worker happened to be an African American who looked to be in his early 20s. He strapped on latex gloves to begin his work. He dug through my suitcase and excavated a small box, unwrapped the folds of paper and held in his palm the bust of Ambedkar that I had been given.“This is what came up in the X-ray,” he said. It was heavy like a paperweight. He turned it upside down and inspected it from all sides, his gaze lingering at the bottom of it. He seemed concerned that something might be inside.“I’ll have to swipe it,” he warned me. He came back after some time and declared it OK, and I could continue with it on my journey. He looked at the bespectacled face, with its receding hairline and steadfast expression, and seemed to wonder why I would be carrying what looked like a totem from another culture.“So who is this?” he asked.“Oh,” I said, “this is the Martin Luther King of India.”“Pretty cool,” he said, satisfied now, and seeming a little proud.He then wrapped Ambedkar back up as if he were King himself, and set him back gently into the suitcase.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe Plans for the extension of the Luas Green line to Finglas, which will put the north Dublin suburb within 30 minutes travel time of the city centre, have been released for public consultation.The proposed route will see the Green line extended from Broombridge in Cabra to Charlestown north of Finglas Village with four additional stops and two new bridges.The 4km extension will bring an additional 30,000 people within 1km of the Luas line, the National Transport Authority (NTA) said. However, it is likely to be another decade before the new line opens to passengers.The cross-city Luas line – the extension of the Green line from St Stephen’s Green to Broombridge – was designed a decade ago to allow a future extension to Finglas. Luas lines to Bray, Lucan, the Poolbeg peninsula, and Finglas were included in the 2016 NTA transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, but the Finglas line is the only route to reach the selection stage.The route, starting at the current Broombridge terminus, would require the construction of a new bridge across the Royal Canal and existing rail line at Ashtown, followed by second bridge just 300m later at Tolka Valley Park to cross the Tolka River. The first stop would be at St Helena’s Road south of Finglas Village. The next stop would be in Finglas Village, the third stop would be at Mellowes Park north of Finglas, with the new terminus at St Margaret’s Road at the Charlestown shopping centre.The route was chosen from a short list of four options and is the most direct alignment from the Broombridge to Finglas. Much of the route will pass through parklands, but “some acquisition of private land will be required”, the NTA said. The route will run along an “attractive grass track” through the parks the NTA said and a new cyclepath will be built alongside the tram line.A park-and-ride facility will be developed at Charlestown and passengers can change to the Maynooth and docklands rail services at Broombridge where the railway station and Luas stops are co-located."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Tom FlemmingFlickrThe Shelbourne Hotel has taken down four statues which have stood outside the hotel for the last 153 years because of their associations with slavery.The four bronze statues were commissioned by the Shelbourne Hotel’s owner in 1867 when the celebrated facade was erected. They depict two Nubian princesses from the lower Nile and their slave girls holding torches.Nubia was for a long time a rival kingdom to Egypt before it was conquered by the Egyptians and its art was an important influence in the 19th century. The princess statues had hieroglyphics down the front of them. The statues were cast in bronze and commissioned from the studios of MM Barbezat of Paris.The Shelbourne Hotel, which has been situated on St Stephen’s Green since 1824, removed them on Monday in line with the decision by other bodies and local authorities to remove statues relating to the slave trade.The hotel’s general manager JP Kavanagh said the decision to take the four statues down had been taken by them alone and there had been no complaints from outsiders about them. “It was a decision taken just by us with our owner and operator. This decision has been coming for a number of weeks given what has been happening in the world,” he said.“ When we restored the facade in 2015 and 2016, we consulted with Irish Heritage and the Irish Georgian Society. “What comes next I don’t know at this stage, but we will work with the relevant authorities.”Mr Kavanagh said there was a possibility that some or all of the statues might be restored to their old plinths but “right now” that is not an option and they hoped to work with Irish Heritage to replace them. “We will share further information in due course,” he added.The five-star hotel underwent a €40 million renovation programme between 2005 and 2007 and was closed for 18 months. It celebrated 195 years in business last year. It was acquired by the global real estate company Kennedy Wilson in 2014 and two year later it completed a significant refurbishment of the exterior facade that later won the Irish Georgian Society’s top award.However, there was no attempt to remove the statues at this stage. The Shelbourne Hotel is five star and operated by Marriott International. The hotel has 265 rooms in total.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4315588.1595931559!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers cast doubt on school reopening time frame","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA ‘staggered return’ to schools would be better than everyone arriving back ‘in big bang theory on one day’, says Deirdre Mac Donald. Photograph: iStockTeachers have cast doubt over whether schools will be able to reopen next month.The Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland (Asti) said it has a “mighty task” ahead of it to get students back within weeks.Deirdre Mac Donald, Asti president, said on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland she was “not confident” the Government’s plan for reopening schools can be put in place within the time frame outlined.“It is the logistics of it,” she said. “Some schools will need more changes to the school infrastructure, or maybe have to get in extra portacabins or space that is available in a nearby hall or something like that.”Ms Mac Donald also warned that getting the 1,000 promised extra teachers, as well as panels of supply teachers in place, “is no small task either”.Minister for Education Norma Foley said the recruits would be drawn from a “variety of pools or strands” including from 1,300 teachers who were already job-sharing in secondary schools. Limits on the number of hours a job-sharing teacher can work are to be lifted.Schools will also be looking to more than 2,000 secondary teachers registered but not teaching “for a variety of reasons” and more than 300 teachers newly qualified and trained this year in the UK, Ms Foley said.“I have every confidence they can be in place in time, in the next number of weeks.”More than 1,000 additional secondary school teachers are to be hired as part of plans announced by the Government to reopen schools at the end of August.A significant funding package of more than €375 million to support schools reopening was signed off at a Cabinet meeting on Monday.Under the plans, extra teachers will be hired to allow some schools to split larger classes to adhere to physical distancing rules of one metre between desks.While she expected significant numbers to be drawn from existing part-time teachers, the Asti president said few would be encouraged to come out of retirement.Ms Mac Donald also suggested a staggered return to schools would be better than everyone arriving back “in big bang theory on one day”.“Everyone has to get used to this new regime,” she said. “Everybody will need their day to get in, see the place, how it works — it is a very different place from September of any other year.”Supply teachers need to be assigned to a school, rather than several schools, she added, to keep “as closed a school regime” as possible.Smaller schoolsMs Foley has urged smaller schools around the country to “reimagine” their space so pupils and staff can safely return under Government guidelines within weeks.Under the roadmap for reopening schools, every primary school class is a “bubble”and smaller groupings or “pods” within the bubble will be distanced one metre apart. Pupils within the pods will also have to stay one metre apart.Ms Foley said €75 million is available as part of a minor works programme to help schools “declutter classrooms, remove all unnecessary furniture and maximise space”.Schools should look at “general purpose areas, assembly areas and reimagine how those spaces can be used to meet the needs of classes at a given time,” she added.“I have confidence that schools will have the potential and certainly have the financial resources to reimagine and to reconfigure spaces where required.”On the plan to roll out piloted substitute teacher panels nationwide, Ms Foley said supply teachers on a year-long contract “will be shared among a small number of schools within a particular location”.On concerns that supply teachers switching between schools risks spreading coronavirus, Ms Foley said: “It will be on a very, very limited basis.”While schools have “autonomy” to meet their own needs, the Minister said they should all be open “as normal at the end of August, early September as it was in the past.”“There is always within schools a latitude to decide what exactly will be their opening day – whether it is the 27th of August or the 25th of August or the 1st September,” she said.“That latitude within a couple of days remains, but in the main what I am saying is schools will open as normal at the end of August, early September.”Weeks-long delaysSome schools may be hit with weeks-long delays in reopening, John McGowan, general secretary of Teachers Union of Ireland (TUI), has said.While every effort will be made to adhere to the Government’s timeline for opening school gates next month or early September at the latest, it is likely “for local reasons that simply won’t be possible” for some schools, he said.“Schools may still be in the business of getting ready to return. In those circumstances, pragmatism has to win out, the school has to be given time to get itself ready.”Some schools may consider a staggered return of students, such as taking in first-year pupils for a short induction period, or incoming sixth years to reintegrate them, according to Mr McGowan.“Hard and fast statements and hard and fast rules on this are unhelpful in the current circumstances,” he said.Mr McGowan suggested schools where work is needed to allow for social distancing could suffer setbacks with delays in getting contractors.“If schools are not made ready on the button, pragmatism has to apply, “ he added.Mr McGowan said he would be surprised if there were weeks-long delays for most schools “but in some local circumstances that can’t be ruled out.”On plans to hire more than 1,000 new teaching staff, Mr McGowan told RTÉ’s Today with Sarah McInerney it will be “very difficult” but he added it is “necessary”.While part-time staff and those on job shares could have their hours upped, he suggested there were several hundred students in their second year of professional master of education qualification, who are Garda vetted and registered with the Teaching Council, who could also be targeted.Also, those on a career break, whose plans may have gone awry because of the crisis, might be interested in returning to work.It was “wistful and nostalgic” to suggest teachers working overseas might return to Ireland, he said, adding that those abroad were there because of pay disparity at home, saving for a home-loan deposit or because they have a permanent full-time post.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4315819.1595946801!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"over 2 000 pandemic unemployment payments stopped after airport checks taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRyanair Check-in Area at Terminal 1 in Dublin Airport. Photograph: Alan Betson Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said there should be a review of the case of welfare recipients whose pandemic unemployment payment (PUP) was stopped because of overseas travel and who were unaware of the rules about going abroad.He also said that more than 2,000 pandemic unemployment payment claims have been closed as a result of checks carried out at Dublin Airport. Mr Martin told the Dáil that “ the vast majority of these cases related to iniduals leaving the country permanently rather than holidaymakers”. “These people no longer live here and are not entitled to this payment so it has been stopped. Most people would say that this must be checked on an ongoing basis. It is also important that this type of thing be dealt with in respect of schemes more widely.”He said that since July 7th 104 Pup and 44 jobseeker payments had been stopped. He said in the Dáil that “I wouldn’t be out to in any way undermine any inidual or take from them their legitimate entitlements” and fair play should apply.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald accused the Government of “blatant discrimination” against one section of society for travelling overseas and called for regulations on the issue to be rescinded.She said they were choosing those who had lost their jobs to be punished for travelling abroad and this is “yet another episode in an unfolding farce”.There has been growing controversy over the stopping of the PUP following airport checks. A further 44 had benefits such as jobseeker’s allowance cut off for travelling abroad.The Department of Social Protection has said the vast majority of those whose payment was cut where leaving the State permanently. A recipient must be living in the State in order to receive the PUP and cannot be absent from the State. Neither is the payment paid to iniduals during a 14-day quarantine period.Mr Martin told Ms McDonald that “in the case of iniduals who may not have been aware of this, genuine recipients, I would like their cases reviewed. That’s something I would like to do.”The Taoiseach said the Sinn Féin leader was attempting to create a picture that the State was “adopting a punitive approach” and he insisted that was not the situation because the Government was supporting hundreds of thousands of people through the pandemic payment.The Sinn Féin leader said the Government was target unemployed people who may have booked a holiday abroad months ago and who would not qualify for State supports to holiday in Ireland.Calling for the decision to be reversed she claimed the regulation had been incorporated into social welfare guidance early on Monday morning, just 24 hours after the Tánaiste had “set out his position” on travelling abroad.Mr Martin said however that the statutory instrument or regulation on welfare recipients travelling abroad had been signed on July 10th.He stressed that the payment was aimed purely at social protection and not for those “who are leaving the country for good and still claiming” the benefit. They had to ensure “proper compliance in relation to the wider taxpayer”.He said the Department of Social Protection had been saying this “in response to numerous questions” but it had not got any attention until the Business Post reported on Sunday that payments had been stopped.She also questioned the Taoiseach on claims by the Tánaiste that it got information from the airport even though the Dublin Airport Authority categorically denied this.Mr Martin said the Department of Social Protection had been carrying out airport checks since 2012 to ensure proper compliance.But the House rejected by 76 to 55 a vote called by Rise TD Paul Murphy to change Dáil business to debate his motion to rescind regulations on overseas travel."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Harry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleNajib may face decades in jail after conviction linked to multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandalGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet. Too many people died,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Do we get on with our lives and put up with Covid-19? Or do we try to hide away from the risk of infection in the hope that one day it will go away?Let us remind ourselves of how we got here. The Government was panicked into imposing a lockdown in March by Professor Neil Ferguson’s Imperial College modelling report. The report is notorious for predicting a “reasonable worst-case scenario” of 510,000 deaths. But it made another important point which is often overlooked. A lockdown would only save a significant number of lives if it was kept in place indefinitely, until there was a vaccine, “which could be 18 months or more”. Otherwise, the virus would simply rebound, probably worse than ever, after it was lifted.Professor Ferguson’s team had previously put the point like this. Aggressive isolation policies “merely push all transmission to the period after they are lifted, giving a delay but no substantial reduction in either peak incidence or overall attack rate”. The current spikes in countries that have lifted lockdowns, such as Spain, Germany, Japan and Hong Kong, bear this out. Some of them had longer and stricter lockdowns than we did.It follows that, as far as the lockdown was concerned, there were only ever three coherent options. Option one was to have no lockdown. Option two was to have an indefinite lockdown, putting our whole national life into cold storage for the duration at unimaginable cost. Option three, which the Government chose, was to have a lockdown for long enough to allow the intensive care capacity of the NHS to catch up. In the event it caught up within a month.The Government lifted the lockdown in June, six to eight weeks after it had lost any justification even by its own logic. But let us declare a truce on whether it was imposed too early or lifted too late. The question now is what happens next.The Government’s position appears to be that the famous R-number can be kept below 1 without a lockdown but with social distancing. Some epidemiologists agree with this. Others do not. I do not propose to venture into those murky waters. But assuming that the Government is right, there are some awkward issues to be confronted.One is that if the R-number can be kept below 1 with social distancing alone, then we could have done it in March instead of locking down. This is not hindsight. It is what Sweden did. It is fashionable to rubbish the Swedish approach. But their deaths per million of population are substantially lower than ours. Their hospitals were never overwhelmed. They never closed their schools. The predicted damage to their economy is about half of ours.The most awkward question, however, is about the exit route. Assuming that social distancing can keep transmission of the disease low, it has to be kept in place indefinitely until there is a vaccine. What does this mean for our world?Physical proximity to other people is not some sort of optional extra which can be ironed out of our culture. It is fundamental to our humanity. Conversation round a table, friendship, love and tears, children at play, most educational activity, depend on physical proximity. Our whole transport infrastructure, the buildings in which we work, play and eat out, depend on our being close together. With social distancing, physical cooperation becomes impossible. The social dimension of work all but disappears. The House of Commons, a great national forum in the crowded chamber, is reduced to a poor phone-in programme in a half-empty space. With social distancing there is no crowd around the bar, no singing at weddings, no orchestras or choirs, no theatre, no sport, no live audiences – in short, no collective activities, only the dismal solitude of the electronic screen. We have surrendered our liberty to the virus. Are we to surrender our humanity as well?Masks, by comparison, are a minor issue. They are uncomfortable and depersonalising. They conflict with a basic instinct of Western society to interact visually, showing our faces. But if they encourage people to come out and live together again or to send their children to school, that can only be good. People will soon tire of them.The brutal reality is the same, masks or no masks. We are going to have to live with Covid-19 whether we like it or not, unless and until there is an effective vaccine. And not just with Covid-19.Shocking? Perhaps. But only because in Europe we have had a false sense of security for so long. In the last two decades there have been Mers and Sars. Before that there were Asian flu, Hong Kong flu, H1N1, and non-respiratory epidemic diseases like HIV, Ebola and Zika. All of them had higher case mortality than Covid-19. But, apart from HIV, they barely touched Europe.This seems likely to change. International movement of people and other organisms is increasing. A major UK pandemic has been top of the National Risk Register since it was first published in 2008. It estimates that a new strain of flu could cause between 50,000 and 750,000 additional deaths in the UK and that emerging diseases, usually originating in animals, are a growing threat whose impact is unpredictable but may be very high.Covid-19 is a serious disease, but historically it is at the bottom end of the scale. For any one under 50 the risk of death is tiny, less than for seasonal flu. In the great majority of cases the symptoms are mild or non-existent. Our ancestors lived with far worse epidemic diseases without rushing to put their heads in a bag. In other parts of the world they still do (world-wide, tuberculosis kills many more than Covid-19).We all need to make our own personal risk assessments in the light of our age and state of health and the sort of activities in which we engage. For some people, social distancing will remain a sensible precaution. The rest of us should respect their choice but drop it and get on with our lives. We cannot keep running away.Jonathan Sumption is a former Justice of the Supreme Court and was BBC Reith Lecturer for 2019More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"church blamed frances coronavirus epidemic","story":"As an evangelical pastor in Mulhouse, eastern France, Samuel Peterschmitt has spent most of his life spreading the good word.For the past four months, he has been fighting allegations his Open Door church carelessly sowed death.“People need scapegoats,” he sighed.Mr Peterschmitt, 55, was speaking from the vast hall of a former supermarket in the poor, multicultural suburb of Bourtzwiller, which he transformed into a “super church” able to house a burgeoning congregation twice a week.His “crime”? Holding an annual mass gathering of fasting and prayer from February 17 to 21 many branded the supercluster that turned Mulhouse into France’s Covid ground zero and the country into one of the world’s worst hit.For five days, around 2,200 people from around mainland and overseas France, neighbouring Switzerland and Germany and even Burkina Faso sang gospel and clasped hands.“We’re going to celebrate the Lord! Are you feeling the joy tonight?,” the charismatic pastor asked as they prayed for a miracle cure from ailments. Little did he know that the coronavirus had also entered the building and that almost his entire flock would be infected, 80 hospitalised and 31 die from the disease.When followers returned home, they unleashed what one top health official called a “viral nuclear bomb” whose fallout was felt around France.The health minister called it France’s “flipping point”. Its scientific council said without it, the country would be on a par with Germany - only 15 minutes away for 45,000 cross-border commuters but which suffered a third as many deaths.Twisting the knife, the state prefect of the Grand Est region, Josiane Chevalier, accused the church of failing to respect basic “social distancing measures: in short, everything you shouldn’t do”.The claims triggered torrents of hate mail. One of hundreds of messages read: “Thanks again for the French pandemic. We know who you are”.“The main culprit should have died so that this sect could answer for all the evil it has inflicted on Mulhouse!,” read another.Joining his hands, Mr Peterschmitt said: “We have received calls on social media to ‘gun him down with a Kalashnikov’ or ‘burn the church’. A colleague even received death threats at work.”Returning to the four corners of France, believers who fell ill said they were ostracised.Antoinette, a 70-year-old grandmother who lives on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, said she could not be fully identified as believers had been stigmatised by people outside the church for spreading the virus.“People have pointed their finger at me. They need a scapegoat, she said.Indeed, there is mounting evidence that the disease was already spreading relentlessly in the region before the gathering and that French health authorities had failed to pick up far earlier warning signs of impending disaster.President Emmanuel Macron gave a speech barely 200 yards from the church that very week. “He was shaking hands and taking selfies for an hour and a half,” said local shopkeeper Simsek Meleki, 40. \u0027Now people joke that Macron brought the virus with him.”Mr Peterschmitt asked: “How do expect us to know there was a risk if the President of France wasn’t aware of it?Two recent studies, one on chest X-rays in nearby Colmar, another quizzing 3,300 locals, suggest that that the first cases date back to November and that the epidemic had already taken off by mid-February in the area.Laurent Gerbaud, an epidemiologist at Clermont-Ferrand university hospital, said the findings suggested health authorities had failed to detect early warning signals.  “We have a woefully centralised bureaucracy incapable of receiving information from the ground up,” he said.All that said, there was little doubt, he added, that the church gathering turbo-charged contamination in France.Nobody felt ill during the event, but the following week, the pastor came down with flu-like symptoms and by Sunday, at least 800 people didn’t show up to church.On March 2, his son Jonathan tested positive and warned local health authorities about the gathering. That very same day, the first Covid patient was admitted to intensive care in Mulhouse’s Emile-Muller hospital.Joy Mootien, 54, chief consultant at the hospital’s medical intensive care unit remembered his patient zero well.“He was lying in his bed with breathing difficulties. When I saw the chest X-ray, I instinctively grabbed my mask,” he recalled. His family said he had not travelled recently but his wife did mention a large church gathering.“When I heard how big it was, I knew we were in trouble.”That night, Patrick Vogt, 64, a doctor fielding emergency calls in Mulhouse, witnessed the tidal wave.“More than 1,000 people rang in with such symptoms. It was frightening. We weren’t prepared here or in France,” he said. Despite the flood, state authorities calmly announced just six cases in the region the following day.“There was a chasm between what we were seeing on the ground and the official claims the virus was contained,” said Mr Vogt. “We lost two weeks pinpointing the church cluster,” he claimed.On March 5, gasping for air, Mr Peterschmitt was hospitalised. “I felt like a candle in the wind and thought my final hour had come. I was quite calm,” he said. Some 18 members of his family were struck down.That evening, Jean Rottner, 53, a casualty doctor and president of France’s Grand Est region sent a text message to President Emmanuel Macron.“I told him: ‘Watch out, what is happening here is not in line with the discourse we’re hearing in France. Please understand we’re in the midst of an epidemic.” In two days, the number of local cases multiplied by eight.French pride in its globally lauded public health took a huge knock when it realised that Germany was coping far better. Mr Rottner said this was partly down to mass testing, better communication between GPs and hospitals and far more intensive care beds - some 20,000 to France’s 5,000 at the start of the crisis.“But also we had this very particular cluster in Mulhouse which led to a brutal viral explosion. Germany didn’t have to deal with a problem of that magnitude.”At the hospital, very quickly all ICUs were full.“We were not on the front line, we were the front line,” said Marc Noizet, head of A\u0026ampE and emergency services.As critical patients kept arriving, soldiers were dispatched to construct a field hospital in the hospital car park with another 30 beds.Patients were ferried by helicopter to surrounding hospitals, then by plane and specially medicalised TGV fast trains to less affected regions of France. Others were sent to neighbouring Switzerland, Germany, as well as Luxemburg and Austria, whose hospitals were never underwater.In town, taxi driver Salah Aitabbes, 55, recalled: “It was like a science fiction movie with helicopters coming and going, the wail of ambulance sirens, empty streets and hearses.”A few hundred yards from the Open Door Church, Brigitte Ritz’s undertaker business was overwhelmed.“When you work with death, you tame your fear but this was different,” she said, arranging plastic flowers.“The funerary centre had coffins piled up with the air conditioning on full blast. When that was full, they were put in a special refrigerated hangar,” she said.Four months later, the death toll in the Grand Est region’s hospitals from Covid-19 is 3,383 with 1,809 more deaths in nursing homes. France, meanwhile, has just surpassed the 30,000 deaths mark.Many who did pull through intensive care are still struggling to recover.Malika Fisli, an auxiliary nurse from Mulhouse, was plunged into an artificial coma mid-March and woke up in Brest, western France, two weeks later.Today, she has lung scarring that will take up to nine months to heal and requires daily physio to regain 16kg of lost muscle. “I get breathless and have palpitations,” she said.“I still don’t dare go into shops and get angry when I see groups of people without masks.”Mrs Fisli worked in a nursing home, many of which turned into silent death traps. On her floor alone, ten among 49 elderly residents died of the disease and half her colleagues fell ill.She suffers from flashbacks in which she runs towards a blinding light and can hear a man saying: “Unplug her”. “But doctor, she’s only 58 and has four children,” another, female, voice chimes in.It was no nightmare. “During the coma, I heard these things. Afterwards, I asked the nurse if it was true. She went pale and confirmed that it was. I owe her my life,” she said. “But I don’t blame the doctor, he was only doing his job.”Like Malika, Mulhouse - a town with a proud industrial past sometimes referred to as the “French Manchester” - is slowly healing.“We were, without doubt, France’s ground zero,” said Mr Rottner, the Grand Est president.“We all know people who died, families that were affected. We won’t forget that. But we know our challenge is to shed this image of a region that was seriously hit by this disease and show that we can recover.”Others said it was high time to turn the page.“I’m fed up with Mulhouse being singled out as a pestilential city,” said Jean-Claude, a train conductor. “The truth is that for most of us it wasn’t as catastrophic as all that and certainly no worse than in Paris,” he said.As locals return to cafes, bars and restaurants, French health officials are fretting about an uptick in infections with the “R number”, which reflects infection rates, now above one in most regions. But ironically, the only one today below that dangerous watermark is the Grand Est.Back in his empty church, Mr Peterschmitt checked hand gel and spacing between chairs that have quartered capacity to 600.After weeks of online worship from his living room, he was finally about to meet the faithful in the flesh for the first time since that fateful gathering.Still weakened from his illness, he said he was worried about the future.“We’re in a very sensitive area here. What if a madman passed by and shot followers during the next worship?,” he asked.“Human beings are predators for their own kind. All this proves I was right to be a pastor and evangelist. Rousseau said, \u0027man is good but society corrupts him\u0027. The bible says, \u0027the heart of man is bad and society is simply its reflection.\u0027”“We are guilty of nothing. We were a fire in a forest already burning.”Despite his fears, he said he was looking forward to reconnecting with his flock.“I will tell them two things: how happy I am to see them again and to take heart: we can’t keep looking in the rear mirror. Life goes on.’”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must slim many nurses fat","story":"Shortly after reading Matt Hancock’s article about combatting obesity in yesterday’s paper, I emerged from a café to find my way virtually blocked by an enormously wide, youngish woman in a nurse’s uniform. It was a vivid reminder of a general fact about the National Health Service: many of its staff are fat.That matters, not only for the health of the NHS staff involved, but also for the effectiveness of any anti-obesity campaign. If the public are being urged to lose weight, they will not take the message seriously if they notice that a substantial proportion of those caring for them are not doing so. It reminds me of the days when lots of doctors still smoked.In his article, the Health Secretary also mentioned “stark inequalities in our nation’s health”. These are apparent within NHS staff. Sightings of fat NHS doctors are definitely unusual these days. Nurses and ancillary staff, on the other hand, are often disproportionately tubby.Why should this be? My guess is that the NHS, as a collectivity, is not a very health-conscious employer. What sort of food is served to hospital staff? Are they discouraged from eating too many American-style muffins? Certainly most hospital food for patients remains fattening and unappetising. Most hospital public coffee-shops groan under the weight of buns and fizzy drinks.The Government justifies an anti-obesity campaign partly in terms of the need to “help protect the health service”. As with its coronavirus slogan, this gets the problem back to front.Obviously, all citizens should behave well towards the public services. There is something even more disgusting, for example, about rioters who attack police and emergency services rather than just lamp-posts or one another. But the public do not exist to look after the NHS. The NHS exists to look after us.It will be an evil day if our defective lifestyle choices ever count against us when receiving medical treatment. When the AIDS epidemic began in the 1980s, one chief constable said that AIDS victims were “swirling around in a cesspool of their own making”. Even if this had been true, it would not have justified rationing or withholding their treatment. Motorcyclists and riders get more head injuries than the average. Drunks suffer from far more ailments than the sober.All of us, even the most virtuous, create work for the NHS simply by being alive, especially if we have the impertinence to get old. Don’t let’s go down the slippery slope of judging patients on their moral worth.The good reason for slimming is that you, and those dear to you, will usually have a happier and healthier life as a result. The message should be as simple as that.Last night’s BBC Panorama programme, China’s Coronavirus Cover-up, laid out the story efficiently. There can surely be no reasonable doubt that the Chinese Communist Party reacted slowly and mendaciously to the appearance of the virus. The results were literally fatal for thousands, arguably for hundreds of thousands all over the world. The programme brought this home.Two things, however, worried me. Both of them arose from the testimony of the programme’s star witness, Professor Kwok-Yung Yuen, who was part of the first delegation of external medical experts allowed to visit Wuhan.Professor Yuen spoke well and seemed wholly honourable, but it occurred to me that he might have fallen into a trap laid by the regime. He was told by the Wuhan authorities, he said, that the city’s wet market had been completely cleaned up before his arrival and that samples of only some of the animals there had been preserved. The implication, accepted by the programme, was that evidence of the disease’s origin had been erased.There is an alternative explanation. If it is true, as the scientists Angus Dalgleish and Birger Sorensen have posited in their learned paper on the subject (see this column, June 6) that the killer virus originated not in the market but in the Wuhan lab, then the reason for destroying much of the “evidence” from the wet market was not that the truth lay there, but that it did not. The Chinese wanted people to believe that the market contained something important, when actually it did not. You could put it thus: another creature from the animal kingdom, as well as bats and pangolins, had been available in the market – red herrings.My other doubt concerned Professor Yuen’s assertion that there had been “some cover-up locally”. I bet there was but surely the key point is that there was more than some cover-up nationally, at the highest level.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"not oxford history students should worried people marking exams","story":"Time was, when what examiners for a history paper wanted to know about a candidate was whether he or she had sufficient knowledge and understanding of a period to answer the question intelligently. And if the candidate could write fluently and legibly too, better again.Happy days, because now it seems historians at Oxford have to register all sorts of things besides: correct views on class and regions an obsession with gender and class issues and disdain for the story of monarchs.That at least is the gist of the examiners’ report from Oxford this year on preliminary exam papers. They complain that answers on the role of women in the early modern paper “produced some bad answers” including essays which “implied that the only women with any agency were those who became queens regnant”.Now consider that word “bad”. Is it “bad” in the sense of incorrect, viz, showing no grasp of the dynamics of the period, or errors of fact or no knowledge of the sources? Nope, what is bad about these essays are they unsound, viz, they have not absorbed the approved view in (parts of) the history faculty.For instance, the examiners expressed regret that of the students who took a paper in medieval Christendom and its neighbours, just 13 chose to write essays on women, men or gender.“The overwhelming majority of essays, that is, the other 185 essays, barely mentioned women,” they said.This, they reckon, should “worry everyone teaching the paper and everyone taking the paper”.Really? The one bit of freedom you have in an exam is to pick whatever essay questions you like. And if you’re more interested in the First Crusade than in the role of women as anchoresses, well, it’s a free world. Or at least, it was.And what is “remarkably bad” about dwelling on monarchs and queens? Granted, very many women did have agency in medieval and early modern Europe – but to dwell on the more obvious women (rulers), whom the sources actually talk about is not necessarily a bad answer but a reasonable choice.The examiners don’t like either the way some candidates treat particular social groups with “patronising disdain” – for instance, referring to the North as “backwards” and the Irish as “tribal”. Well, the Irish in this period were tribal, in the sense of primary allegiance being to a local ruler or family. But as with all these things, if the candidate knows his or her stuff and can argue the case, fair enough. Or at least that used to be what mattered.For later periods, it seems candidates wrote about class during Victorian and modern Britain “particularly poorly” with students showing “very little understanding of what class was”. Back in the Seventies, when Marxists were an actual thing there was a forensic interest in class all right, but it was a pretty partisan one.This examiners’ report is worrying all right, but for what it tells us about them. There are all sorts of things that should trouble us about history as a subject, chiefly the terrifying way in which European history is hardly taught in schools – though slavery and the civil rights movement is. These examiners would probably have taken a dim view of papers from AJP Taylor or Hugh Trevor Roper too, whose opinions on all these issues were off message. They were still brilliant historians possibly better than this lot.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel updates five new countries added fco travel corridor","story":"As of today, Slovenia is now on the list of countries Britons can visit without going into quarantine on returnQuarantine to be cut to 10 days for people arriving from Spain Holiday quarantine: Which country will be next?

We were one of the first hotels to open in the capital and have assiduously followed health and safety protocols for the benefit of our guests.

According to Tripadvisor, at least.No longer is the seaside Devonshire town to be associated with the farcical antics of hotel owner Basil Fawlty, but instead for the modern havens to be found amid the palms.Without further ado, this is, allegedly, the world\u0027s finest B\u0026ampB.Addressing members of the Cabinet’s “Covid-O” committee on Saturday afternoon, Chris Whitty made one thing clear: doing nothing was not an option.The six senior ministers on the video call had just been given the news they had been dreading - that Britons had started to import coronavirus from a country deemed “safe” by the Government.Read Gordon Rayner\u0027s full report on why Spain was added to the UK quarantine list, here.In an interview for Telecinco, Pedro Sanchez – Spain\u0027s Prime Minister – said the decision to quarantine tourists arriving from the country into the UK was \u0027unmeasured\u0027 and inappropriate.A growing number of commentators are asking whether quarantine measures are necessary at all, as more European countries switch to airport-based Covid tests as an alternative – combining the need to contain Covid-19 with the need to save thousands of desperately struggling tourism businesses, Tom Mulvihill reports.This is the lowdown on how airport testing could work.Javier Piñanes, director of the Spanish Tourist Office in the UK says“As outlined by our Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, we do not feel that this decision by the UK government is adjusted to the epidemiological situation in the country.  We regret this decision but we do respect it.In accordance with the messages from our Ministry of Health and Foreign Affairs, I would like to outline the following points.We believe that the situation is in a controlled phase regarding the pandemic. Outbreaks were expected to appear and are being detected early and are being controlled with an early response plan agreed with Spain’s regions. In areas with bigger outbreaks such as Barcelona, Lleida and Zaragoza, the respective Autonomous Communities (or regions) have taken very forceful measures with regards to social distancing, which will allow them to regain control.Of the new cases detected, more than half are asymptomatic, which demonstrates the screening work being carried out with more than 4 million PCR tests already having been carried out. It is also important to note that hospital pressure remains low acute beds are below 1,500 patients and critical beds are around 160.Finally, just to outline that the death rate in Spain remains very low patients deceased by Covid in the last seven days totals approximately 10 people. Safety is our number one priority and we hope that the UK travel advice is revised soon to help the travel sector that has invested so much resource to allow a safe and secure reopening.”Here\u0027s everything you need to know about the situation in Spain.So says Greg Dickinson, who visited a club in Amsterdam last Thursday.There was a very limited capacity, no more than 45 people, which was enough to feel atmospheric without being irresponsibly packed in the aftershock of a pandemic. Best of all, my friend and I could actually hear each other speak.I suppose what I’m really describing here is a makeshift, low-capacity bar with live music. There’s nuance to this, of course. Clubs can only stay alive if they are getting enough bodies through the door and buying drinks, so once it’s possible they will go back to capacity. Queues and crowds will and must return. But in the meantime, this is a form of clubbing I can get into.The daily statement from Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, the federal government agency and research institute responsible for disease control and prevention, last Friday made for disconcerting reading: “The number of newly submitted cases on Friday, July 24, 2020, at 815, is significantly higher than in the previous weeks,” it said.These numbers represent the sharpest spike since the middle of May. The report offers various reasons, ranging from larger celebrations in family and friend circles, increased leisure activities, to rises within workplaces, community and health facilities.A new testing facility at Dusseldorf AirportBut it also mentions returning travellers as a new cause, a point which is underlined by images circulating in the media of German tourists flouting social distancing rules in destinations such as Mallorca and Bulgaria.Read the full report here.Quarantine for people arriving from Spain and other countries with high levels of Covid-19 will be cut to 10 days under plans being finalised by ministers, Charles Hymas reports.The Government hopes to announce this week a new policy of testing arrivals from high-risk countries eight days after they land. If they test negative they will be allowed to come out of self-isolation two days later, reducing the mandatory quarantine period by four days.The move will cut almost an entire working week off the self-isolation requirement, and ministers hope it will help salvage the summer holiday season for some of those already booked on flights abroad.Read the full article here.A big day in the world of travel, yesterday.

Huge category, this.Then there\u0027s also a chance for Reese Witherspoon in The Morning Show, too (could she get two nominations this year? Little Fires Everywhere is a big contender in the Limited Series category).Who else is there? Jennifer Aniston for The Morning Show, which will probably be named in a few categories.Let\u0027s stick with The Outsider. It didn\u0027t set the world alight, but Cynthia Erivo\u0027s performance was one of the year\u0027s\u0026nbspbest. Julianne Nicholson\u0027s too. A nomination for either would be a very good thing.Sterling K Brown is a dead cert for This Is Us, although new competition could rear its head in the form of Tobias Menzies for his role as Prince Phillip in The Crown. There\u0027s also Al Pacino for Hunters, which Amazon Prime Video has been trying to make happen for a while now, and Ben Mendelsohn for cult HBO show The Outsider.Who will join the Succession boys in the main acting category? Expect to see Jason Bateman (Ozark), Billy Porter (Pose) and Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul).A nod for The Handmaid\u0027s Tale wouldn\u0027t come as too much of a surprise, but the same cannot be said for Westworld, whose third season was... not as good as what\u0027s come before.Then, there are some of the\u0026nbspold regulars: The Crown, Better Call Saul, Ozark, Pose and This Is UsExpect nominations for *takes deep breath* Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook, Kieran Culkin and Matthew Macfadyen – and, with any luck, Nicholas Braun and J Smith Cameron.The 2020 Emmy Awards hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, will take place on 2 September.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She’s definitely referencing Kanye West I’m screamingggg,” one fan wrote.Another tweeted: “Nobody:      Me: in Peace, Taylor Swift capitalised West but not east. She called Kanye a clown.”The Independent has approached Swift and West’s representatives for comment.Swift and West have been in a longstanding feud since the 2009 MTV VMAs. Some critics have suggested that the “I Knew You Were Trouble” singer released Folklore last Friday to coincide with the intended release date of West’s new project Donda: With Child.However, Swift stated that she hadn’t “overthought” the new release date, writing on social media: “Before this year I probably would’ve overthought when to release this music at the ‘perfect’ time, but the times we’re living in keep reminding me that nothing is guaranteed.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

The dissident artist said: “What is happening in Xinjiang is a look into the future of what will happen to Hong Kong. China sees it as simply a matter of domestic policy to crack down on minority groups by the hundreds of thousands. Tibetans have also faced similar treatment. It has been this way for years.” He added: “The Hong Kong situation has shown us that this authoritarian society will never give any space for discussion or negotiation. It is simply incapable of communicating with those with different ideas or ideologies.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“They have always been this way and as long as the communists exist will remain the same into the future,” he continued. “‘One Country, Two Systems’ was finished the moment China applied its national security law to Hong Kong. China violated its own promise. It is a society that is unreliable and cannot be negotiated with.”Ai Weiwei among top artists donating work to our campaign auctionWhen will the UK take action over China\u0027s abuse of Uighur Muslims?\u0027Virtually entire\u0027 clothing industry \u0027linked to Uighur forced labour\u0027The auction is raising money for The Felix Project. Founded by Justin Byam Shaw, the former chairman of The Independent, Felix is the largest food surplus distributor in the UK and our appeal beneficiary. Weiwei stressed the importance of ensuring people have enough to eat. “Sharing food is the most fundamental human gesture, beyond ideology or religion,” he said. “Food is essential. It has a much more profound meaning about how we understand ourselves and how we relate to our culture. But for those who lack necessary nutrition, it’s really a matter of human dignity. Too often that dignity is in a shattered state.“I have visited dozens of refugee camps around the world where people ate in unthinkable conditions,” he continued. “I remember seeing people wait in lines for hours simply for a cup of tea, people cooking over open flames without any tools. Sharing food is the most fundamental human gesture.How to support our campaignSince the pandemic, Weiwei has launched himself into artistic and humanitarian projects. “Every event that happens around me has an impact on my work. I would have no work without the emotions or consciousness raised by those events.” In June he raised over £1m selling face masks with his renowned motifs of sunflower seeds and a defiant middle finger to support the work of international humanitarian charities battling coronavirus. He has also produced three documentaries, one covering a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh and another about life in Wuhan amidst the pandemic.Weiwei is no stranger to engaging with significant events in the Middle Kingdom. In 2009 for example, the Chinese government finally revealed the official death toll from the Sichuan earthquake after Weiwei launched his own investigation. At Munich’s Haus der Kunst he created an artwork – Remembering – out of 9,000 school backpacks to commemorate the students who died when their poorly-built classrooms collapsed after the earthquake.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe coronavirus and China’s subsequent reaction have done little to encourage Weiwei about the country’s status as an emerging superpower. He dismissed his homeland’s reaction to the virus as “untrustworthy, opaque and in denial of responsibility from the very beginning”, continuing: “The casualties are clear and factual. The conclusion from this crisis is still unknown. Many countries still deny the truth or shy away from it.” While he rejects the increasingly popular suggestion of a “new cold war between China and the West”, he warns that — if the West does not have a clear strategy — it “will lose this competition”. Weiwei’s father Ai Qing was one of China’s most eminent literary figures. He fell out of favour with the regime and the family was exiled to Xinjiang in the far-west, where his father was forced to clean communal latrines. In 2015, Weiwei was finally granted a passport and permission to leave China. He now resides in Cambridge and has a studio in Berlin. Of his vision post-pandemic, he said: “Covid-19 compels us to consider fundamental questions. How will society continue to develop? In what way can we still protect humanity and prevent a repeat crisis, especially those that are not natural disasters but the product of hidden and misleading information and irrational thinking on many levels, across different societies?Who are the Uighur people and why do they face oppression by China?China set to block UK’s offer of citizenship to Hong Kong residentsUK scraps extradition treaty with Hong Kong over China’s crackdownAi Weiwei’s Small Plate With Flowers and other works from the Help the Hungry auction are available until 30 July.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Around half a dozen people are thought to have been diagnosed with the bug at the Leighton Arches caravan site in Welshpool, mid Wales.He also confessed that he had flouted the councils order to stay on the site for a trip to the town centre yesterday - but a grocery shopkeeper had refused to serve him.

She planned it.”The -year-old, who did not receive payment for speaking to The Sun, has also reacted to the content.On Sunday, it was reported that Meghan and Harry had “rejected” the idea of getting help to protect her father, as their royal romance grew.He says he was also berated by Harry for co-operating with the press while in hospital recovering from heart surgery.From his home in Rosarito, Mexico, he said: “The fact the royals advised them to get me help and they refused to do it is incredible news.”A heartbroken Meghan, according to the book, sent her dad one final text the night before her wedding.He was due to walk his daughter down the aisle at Windsor Castle until it emerged that he posed for the photographs, which were sold to papers around the world.Yet Meghan was still desperate for him to attend.And Finding Freedom tells of how she left dozens of frantic messages for her dad — telling him a car would take him to Los Angeles airport so he could fly to London for the ceremony.But despite her “barrage of voicemails and texts”, he refused to get in the waiting vehicle.And he did not respond to messages after she called him “at least  times”.Mr Markle then began making a series of bizarre statements to the press and he eventually said the stress of dealing with the media had caused him to have a heart attack.Finally, he told her he would not be coming and only her mother Doria would be there. The book says: “If it wasn’t for Harry, Doria and her friends, Meghan herself says she wouldn’t have mentally got through it.”Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday newspaper for revealing the contents of a letter she wrote to her dad, claiming it was a breach of privacy.Mr Markle said he wanted to share the letter after its contents were publicly misrepresented in order to “vily” him.High Court legal papers revealed Meghan felt “unprotected” by the Royal Family while pregnant with son Archie and was unable to defend herself against  claims. Other private information, which would indicate the Sussexes must have been involved in the biography, includes details of voicemails Meghan sent to her dad and frosty conversations between Harry and William.It claims the Duke of Cambridge told his little brother not to rush things with “this girl” — a comment that allegedly sparked fury from a “p***ed off” Harry.The Duke of Sussex is then said to have moaned to a friend: “It’s a sick part of the society we live in today, and no one is doing anything about it.Where’s the positivity  Why is everyone so miserable and angry ”Meghan is quoted as telling a pal: “I gave up my entire le for this family. I was willing to do whatever it takes.”In another extract, the book amazingly reveals how Harry was left anguished after reading comments online dubbing him a “disgrace to the Royal Family”.A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom.“This book is based on the authors’ own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their independent reporting.”Author Scobie, asked whether there had been off-the-record conversations with the royal couple, said: “You’ve read the book. There are no on-the-record interviews with the couple.”Pressed again, he replied: “No, my time around the couple is enough for me to know my subjects.”Scobie, , has previously been vocal about his elevated access to Harry and Meghan since his time as a royal reporter at Harper’s Bazaar magazine.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a full-scalesoon is not likely. That is not down to animosity... they have not yet reached what they were seeking to do.”  The biography also explains how Harry felt that the “old guard” at Buckingham Palace disliked Meghan. According to the book - which was written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand - the rt between Harry and his brother William was due to some of the Duke of Cambridges comments about Meghan.Prince William is said to have told his brother Harry: “Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl.”Prince Harry felt that his brother’s remark was “snobbish”, the authors write.However, despite the tensions between them Harry still asked William to be his best man at his wedding.Finding Freedom also revealed Prince Harry was the first one to say I love you, while detailing messages that Meghan sent her estranged father Thomas Markle in the lead up to her wedding.But despite the incredible level of detail released in the book, a spokesperson for the couple insisted they had not been involved in the book.They said in a statement: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom.This book is based on the authors own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their own independent reporting.And in an interview with The Times, author Omid Scobie carefully answered: The book doesnt claim to have any interviews with Harry and Meghan. And nor do we.When quizzed over whether the couple had given off record interviews, he added: No, and I think that you can tell from the reporting, my time around the couple is enough for me to know my subjects.Yet the detailed excerpts also revealed Meghans heartache over her father before her wedding to Prince Harry - saying she had sent a barrage of voicemails and messages to the -year-old.The book stated: The night before the wedding, she sent her father one last text. He did not reply.“Sitting in a bath later that night, FaceTiming with a friend, the bride-to-be said she had left her dad a final message, adding: ‘I can’t sit up all night just pressing send’.It was then claimed in the book that Harry and Meghan got secretly engaged on a trip to Botswana two months before telling the world.The biography also claims that Meghan had told a friend that she gave up her entire le for the Royal Family. She is said to have added: I was willing to do whatever it takes.Insiders claim that the Queen will be most affected by the new book.Speaking to Vanity Fair, a source close to the royal family said: “Its going to open old wounds at a time when everyone wanted to move on.“I think the person who will be most upset about it all is the Queen.”Finding Freedom is set to be released on August , but is already among the bestselling books on Amazon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There will be people who think the system isnt fair this year, but the reality is that Covid isnt fair.A DfE spokesman said:  The vast majority of students will receive a calculated grade this summer that enables them to move on to the next stage of their education or training.Ofqual has developed a robust process that will take into account a range of evidence, including grades submitted by schools and colleges, with the primary aim of ensuring grades are as fair as possible for all students.An Ofqual spokesperson said: “We know teachers worked extremely hard to deliver this year’s arrangements and final grades this summer will be calculated using both centre assessment grades and a rank order of students provided by the centre.“It is not true to say the centre assessment grades are not being used – they are an important component of this year’s arrangements and have assisted centres when developing their rank orders. They have been instrumental during testing to identy the fairest process, and are being used to quality assure the outputs. Centre assessment grades are the primary source of evidence to calculate grades for low entry subjects, small centres and those lacking historical data.“From the data that we have reviewed, we expect the majority of grades students receive will be the same as their centre assessment grades, reflecting the skills, professionalism and integrity of those involved.”Any student unable to receive a calculated grade, or who would like to improve their grade will have an opportunity to take exams again in the autumn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Peter Ivory, , now faces a £, bill after claiming he did the right thing by following his dying brother Mickaposs wishes not to let the rest of the family get their hands on his £, fortune. He said Mick was adamant on his deathbed that his money should go to the hard-working poor and homeless because he disapproved of much of his family. After receiving tube driver Mickaposs £, fortune, Mr Ivory says he converted most of the £, that was left after expenses into gold coins, which he then handed out to the needy on the streets of Cambridge, the Isle of Wight and Scotland. But the High Court in London heard because the cash should legally have been split with other members of the family because Mick had not made a will. And now, after being told he committed a monumental breach of his duty as administrator of Mickaposs estate, he has been told by a judge to stump up the cash he owes his relatives. You may think you took a moral position but what you have actually done is deprive other people of money that is actually theirs, and that is not a moral position, said Judge Timothy Bowles. The decision means Mr Ivory, from Hendon, north west London, will have to hand over about £, to his brother Alan, £, to another brother John and £, to his nephew Michael. The court heard Mick died without making a will aged  in November  and that afterwards Peter handled his affairs and arranged the sale of his home in Wallington, Surrey.  Mickaposs estate consisted of the proceeds of sale of the house, his beloved Lurcher dog Lady and a collection of rare Osmond Family memorabilia, accumulated by his we, Pat, who died four years before him. Under normal intestacy laws, which apply when someone dies without making a will, Alan, John and Michael expected to share the money with Peter as Mickaposs surviving next of kin. But Peter told the court he had been holding his brotheraposs hand as he lay dying in hospital and that Mick had been adamant that his money should go to the poor, and not his family. Mick told me to keep it all and,I couldnapost keep it, to give it away, he said.  His whole plan was to make sure they didnapost get it. He said he passed on the memorabilia to the Osmonds fanclub, took in his late brotheraposs dog, handed out a few small gts to others, and then converted most of the rest to gold coins and travelled the country, handing out the fortune to those who needed it. It doesnapost take long to give it away, he said. The case ended up in court after a claim by brothers Alan and John, and nephew Michael, to their share of the estate, which they said Peter had no right to deprive them of.  When the dispute first blew up, Peter wrote to his brother Alan, saying that Mick made me promise not to give his well-earned moneythe rest of the family. In court, Peter accepted that what he did was against the law, but insisted he considered the rest of the family were entitled to nothing morally. Mick worked his whole le,  years on the underground, for that money. I couldnapost give them his money, he said. They didnapost sit holding his hand as he was dying. They didnapost hear what he said to me.  He told me what he wanted to do. I thought my responsibility was to follow my dying brotheraposs wishes. I made a mistake, but I didnapost make a mistake as far as my brother is concerned. Ordering that he hand over the cash to Alan, John and Michael, the judge told Peter he had committed a monumental breach of his duty as administrator of his brotheraposs estate. You knew that they had legal entitlements, but you decided that, because your brother had expressed certain wishes, you werenapost going to comply with the law, he said. What you have done - and have decided to do - is think aposI donapost think much of the people legally entitled to this money and so I am going to give it to someone apos.

There are fears the book could be the final nail in the coffin for the Sussexesapos relationship with other members of The Firm - with Thomas Markle now taking a swipe at the royal couple. He said: This is the worst time in the world to be whining. And in a further blow, he told The Sun: I love my daughter but I really don’t appreciate what she’s become right now. The book - by former royal correspondents Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand - alleges Meghan felt let down when her dad lied to her by denying he helped stage paparazzi photos prior to her wedding in May . A week before the big day, Kensington Palace officials heard the photo shoot was to be exposed in the press as having been staged. The book says palace communications staff and lawyers were moving to have publication stopped, as Meghan phoned her father.  Dad, we need to knowthis is true or not, because my team is going to try and stop this story from running -you are telling me itaposs fake, she reportedly told him. If they do that, theyaposre going out of their way to protect you, Dad. Youaposre telling me youaposre being victimised, right  Mr Markle had replied Of course, failing to admit he had participated in the staging of the photos, which were duly exposed as set-ups in the press the next day.  Despite his deception, Meghan had still wanted her father at her wedding. He ultimately did not attend, partly due to suffering a heart attack days before the event, which he blamed on the stresses of pressure from the media. The book gives further glimpses of Meghanaposs troubled relationship with Mr Markle, including a string of uned phone messages and texts from the former actress to her father in the days before her wedding. A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said the couple did not contribute to Finding Freedom, but he did not deny the content of published extracts.

But it was another lockdown aposfirstapos for the Monarch when she attended a virtual unveiling of a new picture of her. Despite seeing Miriam Escofetaposs piece for the first time over camera, the Queen was very quick to spot a slight issue with the work - and she pointed it out straight away. The portrait, commissioned by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as a lasting tribute to Her Majestyaposs service to diplomacy, shows the Queen sitting on a gold chair next to a round table. A beautul bunch of lilac flowers are sitting on the table alongside a gold tea cup - but itaposs empty. The Queen saw the painting for the first time via her computer screen, before speaking to members of FCO staff about their work around the world during the coronavirus crisis.The virtual visit was hosted by Sir Simon McDonald, permanent under-secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs and head of the Diplomatic Service, who was joined by the artist for the unveiling. Ms Escofet told the Queen during the unveiling that she had included a hidden symbol in the painting - the insignia of the FCO - painted on to a tea cup.  The artist said afterwards: She seemed to react very positively to it. She was smiling, asking how long it took andI had any more projects on the go after this. When I explained certain elements of the painting, the tea cup, she made some amusing comments. She said aposbut thereaposs no tea in the cupapos. Ms Escofet explained some of the details in the painting, which was inspired partly by Holbeinaposs The Ambassadors and the anamorphic distortion technique used by Renaissance painters. As such, she said, she resolved to have a slightly surreal but appropriate element as something intriguing for people to stumble upon. She told the Queen she had settled on a tea cup, including the insignia of the FCO on the saucer and reflected in the cup itself.  The artist said: It felt really right to apply it to the tea cup. Suddenly this very humble object carries this symbolism representing the FCO and linking the portrait to its destination. I explained this to the Queen and she made this very humorous comment about how thereaposs no tea in the cup. I said Iaposm afraid the tea has been sacriced for the symbolism. The painting took seven months to complete, with the final stages finished in lockdown. Ms Escofet had two sittings with the Queen - one at Windsor where she spent around half-an-hour photographing the monarch and the second at Buckingham Palace to focus on her facial expressions. She was chosen on the recommendation of the National Portrait Gallery after she won the BP Portrait Award with a painting of her mother, which Sir Simon said had perfectly captured the luminosity and dignity of her subject.  The Palace had been shown a sketch of her plans for the Queenaposs portrait but had been very hands off and had not interfered, she said. The second sitting at Buckingham Palace came in February, shortly before the reality of the coronavirus pandemic hit the UK, with artist and subject even discussing the situation in Wuhan during their time together. Of the sittings, Ms Escofet said the intensely precious time flew by. Ms Escofet said: Sheaposs a very experienced sitter. Sheaposs fantastic. Sheaposs very much focused on giving you what you need. Sheaposs very present in the room and focused on the job in hand. She has a sense of humour there bubbling under the surface. She was very down to earth,thataposs not a silly thing to say.  In the first sitting I was asking about her experience with previous portraits and whether she had any particular favourites. I tried to tease it out of her, but she was very diplomatic. Because it was at Windsor, a plane flew by and she commented on the noise. The second time, I did most of the talking because I wanted to get a reaction from her face. The painting was unveiled over videocall, with Ms Escofet at the FCO where she mounted the portrait on her own easel with a cloth draped over it. As she and Sir Simon pulled the drape down, she said the Queen smiled and looked very pleased. On the challenges of painting the Queen, she said she had tried to capture the essence of the private monarch alongside the knowledge she was probably the most recognisable person in the world. She added: What I wasnapost expecting was her humour. Iaposm not saying sheaposs cracking jokes, but you can feel it. Thereaposs a real sharpness, a keenness, sheaposs really there, she really takes you in. I guess itaposs a wisdom. I really wanted to catch that essence of her in the portrait. Thataposs a quality that you only really feel when you meet someone. Sheaposs a very powerful, small person, and quite luminous. You can feel this le energy from her, itaposs very striking. That became very useful for me because it meant I could get almost an aura of regalness around her in what was actually trying to be a very humane portrait of her. Sir Simon said the FCO was delighted with the terric portrait. He added: Thereaposs truth and dignity and wisdom in the portrait. We are Her Majestyaposs diplomatic service. There is a bond between this organisation and the monarch. For people to be able to say that the Queen was interested and impressed with their work is a wonderful and really motivating thing. Also on the videocall was Sanjibita Tariang, who has worked for the FCO for  years and is regional consular development officer at the British Deputy High Commission Kolkata, India. She spoke about her role in repatriating more than , Britons after the pandemic struck. She told the Queen about the challenge of co-ordinating the journey of one woman, who made a five-day, ,km trip through a locked-down country to board a plane home.  Seeing the smiles when theyhome and they send you the picture with their family, thataposs what we work for. It makes it all worthwhile, she said. She [the Queen] asked a few questions but she was listening and you could see she was impressed. For me, itaposs a dream come true. I always dreamed that I would one day get to speak to the Queen. That was something really, really special to me. And then when your work is recognised after youaposve put in so much, that really means a lot. It really means everything to all the staff here. Aletheia Bligh-Flower, joint head of global health at the FCO, spoke during the videocall about collaborative work to develop a Covid- vaccine, support vulnerable countries and keep supply chains for PPE open. She said the Queen had been particularly interested in how quickly the FCO had mobilised and knew all about the recent Global Vaccine Summit she had been working on.

The prince flew to Canada to spend time with his new girlfriend, and the American actress stayed with him at his Kensington Palace cottage. But despite their best efforts, news of their relationship was soon leaked and they had just a few hours to prepare before it appeared on the front pages. In their new book Finding Freedom, which has been serialised by the Times ahead of its release next month, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand share details of what happened on the night the couple were told their game was up. They write: One night late in October in Toronto, Harry was happy, and so was Meghan. Until their received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. A tabloid was going to run with the story of their relationship. Their main worry was that her place would be besieged by photographers within  hours. They had little time to think, because there were only a couple of paparrazi in Toronto but it wouldnapost be long before photographers flew in from New York and LA, all hoping to get that first picture of the happy couple. The Duke was inundated with calls from his staff, many of them trying to get him toto London early as they were concerned about his slimmed down security team.  However, he refused to leave. Scobie and Durand claim that while Meghan was nervous about what was to come, she was also relieved as it meant she no longer had to lie to family and friends. They say that she got more than  messages from former friends and acquaintances looking for gossip.

Researchers looked at the nationaposs eco-friendly habits - including a host of factors such as tendency to buy refurbished items, recycling rates, methods of travel - and even time in the shower. Based on the responses of , adults on dferent aspects of sustainability,  cities were awarded points which were then tallied up - and the walled city achieved the highest overall score. The study, by musicMagpie, had York came out top in the inidual category for proportion of those who shop in zero plastic supermarkets - sharing the spoils with Birmingham . And the northeast city also scored highest for the proportion of those who grow fruit and vegetables at home . Second place belonged to Cardf, which scored consistently high throughout - including proportion of those who buy or use refurbished technology . And also for those who up-cycle old household items . Close behind was Oxford, which came third, followed by Plymouth in fourth, and Brighton and Newcastle in joint fth. However, out of all  cities polled, Wolverhampton scored lowest behind Birmingham and Norwich. Liam Howley, chief marketing officer at musicMagpie, said: We all want to do our bit to help the environment, but some things are easier than others. Itaposs interesting to see certain cities are definitely doing more than others, but at the same time nobody truly reigns supreme. There is so much we can each take responsibility for to become more sustainable, and a lot of it is easier than you think. The study found  per cent of everyone polled doesnapost think they do enough to help the environment by reducing their carbon footprint.  Of those who feel this way,  per cent believe they cannot afford to be greener, while  per cent feel the area where they live doesnapost do enough to make it easier to be sustainable. However those polled could turn to Wrexham and Aberdeen for a little inspiration - in two categories apiece at least. Wrexham scored highest when it comes to highest proportion of those who recycle- Birmingham found itself at the other end of the scale . The North Wales city also got top marks for flying the least - . times-a-year on average. On the flipside, despite scoring well overall, the residents of Cardf fly the most - . times. However, Wrexhamhas the highest proportion of residents who drive petrol or diesel vehicles - London has the lowest . While Aberdeen fared the best for using energy-saving light bulbs- Edinburgh and Norwich were joint-worst in this area . Aberdeen was also top of the tree when it comes to shopping for local produce , while Portsmouth scored lowest . It also emerged, those residing in Southampton spend the shortest amount of time in the shower - seven minutes and seven seconds. In contrast, those living in Norwich spend the longest period of time in the shower on average - nine minutes and  seconds. Brighton came top for buying fruit and vegetables loose - rather than in plastic packaging , while Southampton got the fewest points in this category . And finally, Portsmouth has the highest proportion of those who give to or buy from charity shopswith Swansea having the lowest .The musicMagpie study carried out through OnePoll also found half of all those polled wish they knew more about how to reduce their carbon footprint further.But  per cent revealed they donapost know what information to trust.Liam Howley, from musicMagpie, added: One simple thing people can do to make a huge dference, is to consider how they are buying and recycling their tech. Buying high quality, refurbished tech ensures the product continues its le-cycle when it is still fully ing. And stops it from contributing to the increasing problem of e-waste, which is piling up in landfills across the world at an astonishing rate and contributing to  per cent of the toxic waste caused by landfill. Selling back your unused tech to be recycled or refurbished also reduces this problem and can make you some extra cash in the process. . York -  points. Cardf -  points. Oxford - . points.

Thousands of people from Manchester descended on Tamside Business Park, in Denton, for a prohibited car meet on July .It comes after police were tipped off about a number of illegal raves in the area, the Manchester Evening News reports. More than , revellers took part in an unlawful coronavirus party in the neighbouring borough of Oldham last month.Greater Manchester Police is now considering issuing a Public Space Protection Orderin the borough of Tameside. The measure would allow police to prevent certain people from entering the area. The illegal car meet, dubbed aposDMO Shutdownapos, on July  took place at JDK Autoworx garage. It saw the streets taken over by car enthusiasts, who were filmed performing dangerous stunts and driving at speed. Police received at least  calls from horried residents as they watched cars performing wheelies and burnouts on the streets. Other areas of Tameside have already been under close surveillance from police in recent weeks, following intelligence about a number of illegal raves.  More than , people attended a aposquarantine raveapos at Daisy Nook Country Park in neighbouring Oldham earlier in the year, where one man died following a suspected drug overdose. Another illegal rave was prevented by officers in Tameside, which had been due to take place on July . In a letter addressed to Andrew Gwynne, Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, police said they were aposlooking atapos a PSPO covering the whole of Tameside in light of recent events.  The banning order would give police the powers to fine, arrest or remove people from the areaofficers suspect they are there to attend an illegal event. Superintendent Jane Higham said: We are currently looking at a Public Space Protection Order for the whole of Tameside to prevent and enforce the compliance in the future around events of this type. Preventative work is key and once an event like this is up and running, getting them stopped is extremely dficult.  Supt Higham said the force had no prior intelligence about the car meet on July , despite the event having been advertised on social media  hours before. She said the scale of the event escalated quickly, with  vehicles arriving within the first  minutes of the meet. A man has since been interviewed by police in connection with the event. Mr Gwynne said he welcomed the news that police were considering the imposition of a Public Protection Order.  Mr Gwynne said: Any power that helps the police and local authorities to prevent the shut down of a community like Denton and the sheer chaos and disregard for the law we saw last week has to be welcomed. The exact details of what the PSPO would include have not yet been confirmed. Stockport already has a similar banning order in place. Mr Gwynne believes the order would give police the power to prevent people entering the boroughthey fear they are travelling to an illegal event.  He said: We have been looking at having an order to cover the whole borough of Tameside that would prevent any kind of illegal events from happening. It would give police sufficient powers to stop these events from happening in a way they were not able to before. If a PSPO had been in place when the car meet took place then police could have turned cars away. It just sends out another message that the people of Tameside are not happy for their community to be open for illegal activity.

He plastered posters around Cairns in northern Queensland with a picture of Hans Soloaposs shaggy sidekick and his exaposs phone number after their three-year-relationship came to an end.The mum-of-three old News :This has got to be the most childish break-up Iaposve ever had.All he had to do was say aposI donapost love you anymore, I wanna move on. Unfortunately for Jessica, it seemed many Australians fancied they could do a winning Wookiee impression. Iaposm getting phone calls at really strange hours of the night about one oaposclock to about four oaposclock, eh, she told the broadcaster. I thought it was quite funny actually, I thought it was a good joke. But Jessica has since been growing sick of the constant phone calls waking up her kids in the small hours of the morning. She said she is keen for the Chewbacca roar contest to end. But her plight has been going viral in Australia, where fans of the prank on Twitter declared it the story of the year. Jessica told the Cairns Post she was annoyed that some people didnapost believe her.Someone called and said they thought it might have been done as a joke because they watchedput up the poster, she said. It hurts my feelings.  Jessica said while she initially found the prank funny, she was appealing to hopeful Wookiees to stop roaring down her phone line at am.  She got the police involved after her ex allegedly took his revenge even further- dumping his car with the tyres removed in the driveway of her house to block her in. The police got in contact with me and finally theyaposre going to do something about it, she told the far north newspaper.Jessica also claimed she had broken up with her ex after she logged into his Facebook and discovered he was sending messages to other women.But his prank in retaliation for her ditching him appears only to have reaffirmed her decision.

But what , this whole time, youaposve been doing it wrong. A video shared to TikTok has sparked a debate by claiming to reveal the aposcorrectapos way to tie your laces.It cites a  study by UC Berkely which says the most common way to secure your laces - the ‘bunny ear’ method - is the weakest style as it is based on a  knot.The study explains: “There are two ways to tie the common shoelace bow tie knot, and one is stronger than the other, but no one knows why. “The strong version of the knot is based on a square knot: two lace crossings of opposite handedness on top of each other. The weak version is based on a  knot the two lace crossings have the same handedness, causing the knot to twist instead of lying flat when tightened.” And although the study found that both of the knots fail in the same way, it makes clear that one knot is stronger than the other. In the clip the woman demonstrates how you should be tying your shoes. She starts by crossing the left lace over the right lace, before making a loop on the right hand side. Then you should place the left loop around that side and pull it through. The voiceover says: “You want your laces to lie perpendicular to your shoe, not parallel.” Since being posted it has received , likes and thousands of comments debating which way was best. One said: “Isn’t that how everyone does it ” "},{"url":null,"title":"man 20 put kitten jar","story":"NewsMan, , put kitten in jar and watched it gasp for air in sick Instagram videoWARNING DISTRESSING IMAGES Yuri Soroka, from Sokal, western Ukraine, insisted his prank was just an innocent game as he let the kitten out unharmed, however animal rights activists were disgusted by the videoShareByRoksana PanashchukMatthew Dresch:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video man-put-kitten-jar-canned-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news man--put-kitten-jar-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Yuri Soroka put the two-month-old kitten, named as Shurik, into the jar and watched it desperately gasping for air in the town of Sokal, western Ukraine.The young man filmed the trapped and helpless animal on his smartphone before posting the footage on Instagram.The clip shows the black kitten Shurik sitting in a glass jar while struggling to breathe. The footage caused huge public outrage and caught the attention of the police who found and detained Soroka within a few hours. Police spokesman Ivan Sheremet commented: We seized the suspectaposs smartphone which he used to film the video and sent it along with other evidence for examinations. Officers launched a criminal case for animal cruelty against Soroka, who faces up to three years in prisonfound guilty. Speaking with local media, the man said: I donapost understand why to make a fuss. It was just an innocent game. I let the kitten out in a few minutes. It was not hurt. Animal rights activists took Shurik away from its cruel owner following the incident. Volunteer Kristina Chaparina, who is currently taking care of Shurik, said: That man put the kitten, who trusted him, into the jar and watched it gasping for air. The man should be severely punished for what he did. The kitten was terried and inert due to its ordeal. It took several days for Shurik to recover. Now its appetite has improved and it became more active. We are looking for a new caring family for it. It comes after a woman who allegedly shared videos of her hanging, skinning and killing cats and dogs under the name Crazy Cat Lady was charged with animal cruelty."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/07/KCes_Clare_Stanfield_Alphabet_Animals_Dundee_16.07.20-12-140x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"dundee united 1 kilmarnock 1 cammy smith ready to push for premiership place after making most of lockdown","story":"Dundee United goalscorer Cammy Smith has revealed how lockdown has helped get him ready to push for his place.Smith took less than a minute to hit the target for the Tangerines as they drew - in their final pre-season friendly against Kilmarnock behind closed doors at Tannadice on Saturday.Micky Mellon’s men pressurised Killie’s trialist keeper and his mishit clearance landed at the feet of United striker Lawrence Shankland.The Scotland star picked out Smith on the edge of the area and he dashed into the box before sliding the ball into the net.It was certainly a loud and clear message to new boss Mellon that Smith wants to be more heavily involved this time than he was under previous gaffer Robbie Neilson.Indeed, his th and final appearance for United last season was away to Queen of the South on January  and he was subsequently sent out to Irish club Dundalk on loan.Smith revealed that while the coronavirus shutdown has been a dreadful experience for Scottish football, he has made the most of it.“Lockdown has probably helped me,” he told the club’s Arabzone.“I used it in the right way.“When I was at home I used the time to get fitter and clear the head, really.“Last season was tough and I was sent out on loan.“It wasn’t easy but even when the previous managerwas here I came back and got stuck right back into training.“It was a shock when he left but the new manager has come in and been really good with the boys.“He has spoken well and he has that way about him that has gotten the players onside.“You don’t want to go out there and let him or your teammates down.“Since he has come in the tempo has been gone up.“We weren’t really training at that pace.“The gameshave been competitive and there has been tackling, with boys coming off with knocks and stuff like that.“It has been realistic.“That is what happens on a Saturday so that’s what you need.“If you do that during the week in training then come the weekend there are no surprises.“It is early days, obviously, but I aim to keep focused and be pushing on so that I can be part of things here.”Killie eventually recovered from that early blow to equalise through a Greg Kiltie deflected goal just a minute into the second half.It was the newly-promoted Tangerines’ fourth friendly against Premiership sides, following on from fixtures against Motherwell, Livingston and Rangers.Smith added: “It was a good exercise for us.“We have had three very competitive games close together.“I think the past week has been tough for the boys: Livingston, Rangers and then Kilmarnock.“It is all geared towards next Saturday and I think the players and management have gotten everything they wanted out of it.“It has been a dficult pre-season, obviously, with what has been going on but it’s been very good because we have gotten the work done that we needed to get done.“The games have also been very competitive.“They haven’t had that friendly feel to them.“Even this one – it felt like a competitive game.“It has given us a right good look at Premiership opposition. “We have seen what we will be up against and we know ourselves that we can compete.”Next up is the real deal – the curtain-raiser against St Johnstone at Tannadice this Saturday.Smith said: “We are going into the new season in the right frame of mind and looking forward to it.“We just can’t wait to get going.“We will now recover and have a full week’s training to build up to St Johnstone on Saturday.“There is a lot more to come from us so we need to focus and be ready.“Going into that match, everyone will be fighting to get into the team.“There will be that competitive edge.“If you do get a chance to impress then you have to take it because there are plenty of players here who are hungry to get in. That’s a good thing.”United#s starting line-up was: Siegrist, L Smith, Powers, Connolly, Pawlett, C Smith, Robson, Butcher, Harkes, Shankland and Mochrie.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Since they came in they#ve been fine, but recently the dominant male has had a hiss at me.#The main thing is not to run away from them, because they will chase you.#The centre has recently seen an increase in the number of birds coming through the doors, with cockerels, geese, chickens, and even peacocks, among them.Dale added: #Even at this centre alone we#ve had a lot of birds like this coming in.#Poultry are becoming a lot more common, I think that the best thing for people to do is read about these animals and make sure that you#re willing to work with them, as they can be aggressive at times.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The final stage is to solidy all the pencil marks in ink.Carl added: #Originally the plan was to sketch all  cities in the UK but what has transpired in that time is that Scotland has become a separate entity within the  cities.#Having done the sketch of Edinburgh, I ended up going to Dundee and having spent so much time in Scotland I fell in love with it.#I spent a long time trying to get familiar with the buildings and the atmosphere of Aberdeen.#I walked along every street in the city trying to document the process by photographing each building.#To donate to the picture frame fund, visit buymeacoffee sketchnthecityTo find out more about Carl and Lorna#s Sketch in the City project, visit www.sketchnthecityFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.54581225-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.54581225-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.54581225-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.54581225-1-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"pub and lounge to reopen at aberdeens airport","story":"An award-winning lounge and a popular pub are to reopen at Aberdeen International Airport.The Northern Lights Lounge will open its doors again on Saturday, while The Distilling House will open on Thursday.Measures have been put in place to allow passengers to be able to attend both safely.In the lounge, there is now table service, with food prepared to order and drinks delivered to the table.QR codes have also been created to view menus via mobile, which can also be used to place orders at The Distilling House.Tables and chairs are also placed for social distancing, there is a one-way system for entering and exiting and hand sanitising stations have been set out throughout.Customers will be asked for their information when entering for test and protect purposes.Roger Hunt, interim managing director of Aberdeen International Airport, said: “As we ease out of lockdown we have increased our focus on maintaining public safety and that of our staff through the introduction of a series of enhanced safety measures.“Bringing back business safely remains a key priority and we are looking forward to our business partners reopening at our terminal.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

It has won an army of global fans for good reason.Visit avon.ukSmidge , pound.Wandering around shops and supermarkets across the Highlands during the summer months, you will see tourists clutching this elixir.Smidge has been about for a decade now.

Think CK One.Verdict:Did a stellar job as I sat in my tree-covered garden on a still, humid evening.Visit smidgeupMary Jean Highland Midge Lotion , poundThe idea of making a midge lotion is one that Elizabeth and Mary Quinn struck upon by chance. The owners of family-run Mary Jean in Fochabers, Moray, were selling their skincare products at a Highland Games in .The midges were biting and in a moment of inspiration, Mary soaked some kitchen roll in lemongrass oil and hung it from their stall. It worked a treat and an idea took seed, leading to the creation of Mary Jean Highland Midge Lotion.,params: .pushIngredients include lemongrass ndash of course ndash as well as bog myrtle, aloe vera, jojoba, neem and mango. It is a wholesome product: handmade, organic, palm oil-free, vegan-friendly and non-toxic. Available in a ml travel size.

It comes with excellent credentials, including being vegan, hypo-allergenic and as Anderson-McKee puts it \"free from all nasties\".Tried and tested by  Scottish wild campers and walkers, among the ingredients are organic shea butter, coconut and almond oils, lavender, lemon eucalyptus, citronella and myrrh.Application consistency:A sumptuous cream in a sleek metal container.Smell:Pleasant hints of lemon and lavender.Verdict:An impressive new kid on the block that does what it says on the tin.Visit andersonaromatics"},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-schools-four-key-updates-parents-ahead-reopening","story":"PARENTS across Scotland are eagerly anticipating confirmation that schools will go back full time next month.Primary and secondary schools across the country closed their doors back in March to all but a few children.But with coronavirus in Scotland being suppressed to very low levels, things are looking optimistic regarding ato the classroom.Yesterday, education secretary John Swinney provided an update on schools.Here are fourkey things we learned:Teachers:The Scottish Government yesterday announced pound million of funding to employ hundreds of teachers and support staff to help schools reopen.An extra pound million was also pledged to cover other health protection costs.The funding will equate to around  teachers and  support staff.But as Labourrsquos education spokesperson, Iain Gray, pointed out, that accounts for only half a new member of staff per school across Scotland.August   Councils and schools have been working to the August date for some time.But the Scottish Government will not formally announce the August date until July .The Scottish Government has repeatedly stressed that reducing the infection rate is crucial to the reopening of schools, with the First Minister earlier in the week suggesting no more lockdown changes will be made until pupils are back in the classroom.Mr Swinney stressed that in Scotland, the infection rate is ldquoreducing by  per cent each week, but a sudden surge in cases over the next few weeks could sht the Scottish Governmentrsquos confidence that it is safe to re-open schools.Some pupils may have to socially distanceSocial distancingMr Swinney gave parents some much-needed details about the social distancing guidance that schools will be asked to follow ndash but some questions still remain over how this will work in practice.While primary pupils will not have to socially distance when theyon August , all being well, secondary schools will be told to enforce physical distancing rules ldquowhere possible.Mr Swinney said this was due to the scientic advice on social distancing being ldquoless clear for older pupils.Meanwhile secondary schools will be asked to adjust the layout of classrooms and manage flows of people in and out of buildings ndash but with a catch.This social distancing rule in secondary schools will be ldquosubject always to this not reducing capacity within the school.Youth clubsAs well as earmarking pound million for school staff and pound million to help councils meet extra costs in reopening classrooms, pound million of previously announced money will be used to support youth work in connection with schools being reopened.Mr Swinney said this funding has been announced as the sector has ldquocontinued to support and engage children and young people through the pandemic, highlighting the use of digital technology to help mitigate the impact of the lockdown on young peoplersquos mental health."},{"url":null,"title":"staff-face-redundancy-borders-call-centre--","story":"STAFF are facing redundancy at a Galashiels call centre.Sykes has engaged its Nether Road employees in a consultation over their jobs.A Border reader, who said they work at the call centre, told us: \"It cant be helped but its devastating to be losing work at a horrible time.\"A spokesperson for Sykes said: \"After careful review we have started consultation about a reduction in the workforce at our Galashiels site.\"Staff were told about the job losses around three weeks ago, according to the employee who contacted the Border .The employee -

around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt

believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

said the Scottish Government had failed to give councils enough time to push through emergency Covid measures in town centres.Councillor Hoy said: \"Scottish Councils are operating under huge pressure

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

Nobody knew what to expect.ldquoGala day itself was amazing, from the glorious weather to the great response we got from the locals as we travelled around in convoy tooting and waving, visiting many streets of the town which the normal gala parade doesnrsquot visit.

It was great to see so many of you as we travelled around as many streets as we could while visiting the members of the royal court.ldquoTo the royal court children, we didnrsquot want to forget that it would have been your day, we can still have your special day next year.ldquoTo Queen Lily, you were absolutely stunning, even reducing some of the committee to tears your mum and dad will be proud of you, the way you conducted yourself on what should have been your special day.

included introducing parking suspensions across town centres as it looked to create more space outside shops and relocate parking away from high streets.In Haddington town centre there was a furious response after cones and parking suspension notices went up over the first weekend of the changes, leaving traders and their customers fuming.Shop owners who had only just opened their doors feared the restrictions would stop costumers fromcoming to the market town and within days the council announced it was putting parking suspensions in all town centres on hold.Then last week, it announced plans to transform tourist hotspot North Berwickrsquos town centre and create a temporary -space car park on its iconic Elcho Green ndash a much-loved publicspace and putting green.The response from the community, including Solheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew, who voiced concern at losing green space like the Green, saw those plans also shelved as the local authority insisted it was a

temporary use as we gradually move out of restrictions and will also provide a viable alternative to the use of the private car and or public transport for shorter-distanced essential or leisure trips in the area.The works will also include the introduction of temporary crossings of Edinburgh Road at either end of the route through the use of lsquobuildoutsrsquo and bolt-down bollards.MrHampshire added: ldquoWe were aware of a collection of painted stones that have been carefully laid by local schoolchildren alongside the existing footway along Edinburgh Road and recognise that these are

councilrsquos Local Review Body overturned the refusal on appeal after councillors ruled the proposal was better than leaving the building to fall into disrepair.And they questioned whether the design of the new property, which featured extensive glass frontage to let in light, would, in fact, make the amenity more acceptable.Planning officers had estimated the new one-bedroom property would offer just nine square metres of living space in the proposed kitchen living area.The review body was told that there was no set standard for amenity and outlook when it came to conversions like the one put

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

He left behind parents Steve and Gee, sisters Donna, Stephanie, Angella and Dominique, and brother Daniel.Now,  years later, the BBC has made a one-off, -minute drama which imagines the le Walker could have lived.Written by Bafta winner Jimmy McGovern TV series such as Cracker and Broken, and the TV movie Hillsborough, Anthony is inspired by conversations with the teenagers devoted mother Gee.It is not only an incredibly moving and emotional story about loss but is also full of hope and love.The programme came about after Gee approached Liverpudlian McGovernand \"you just dont say no to Gee\", the writer lovingly quips.\"The BBC had just shown a really good film about the death of Damilola Taylor, and I knew thatI went to the BBC with a drama that showed a lead-up to the killing, the killing and the aftermath of the killing, about a young black boy, the BBC would say, Well, weve already done this with the Damilola Taylor story,\" continues McGovern, when we chat over Zoom .\"So, I had to find a fresh way in. Id been thinking about the First World War... the th hour of the th day of the th month, they kept on fighting right up until the th hour, even though everybody knew the war was over.\"Thousands died and I kept on thinking, How many of those men who died could have achieved something in their le  A cure for a virus, perhaps...\"And that got me thinking about Anthony. Thats the way it came about.\"Playing Anthony is Toheeb Jimoh, a rising British star who is set to have a leading role in Amazons highly anticipated sci-fi series The Power, and also appears in the Apple TV+ comedy, Ted Lasso, which is released in August.\"One thing I was painfully aware of was that, had I been born at a dferent time, and I had been at that bus stop in Liverpool, that could have been me - that could have been anyone,\" he suggests.\"As a young black boy myself, it was super-important to me and it was a subject super-close to my heart.\"He confides he was nervous to meet Gee for the first time at the read-through. But when he introduced himself, \"she just basically gave all of us her blessing to tell the story and she wished us the best and it was nothing but positivity and kind words\".He chuckles as he adds what she whispered to him later on that day.\"I was improvising, I was throwing stuff in that wasnt even in the script at some points, and she just pulled me aside and went, Anthony didnt swear!\"A particularly poignant part of the film depicts Anthony getting married, to a woman named Katherine, who is played by World On Fire star Julia Brown.Gee was on set for the wedding scenes, and Jimoh recalls the moment she walked in to see him suited and booted for the ceremony.\"She grabbed me, and she went, Wow. This is what my son would look likehe was getting married.\"It was huge for both of us and we had the longest hug in the world.\"Katherine is not based on a real-le person, which Brown - known for BBC series World On Fire - describes as \"liberating\".However, there were obviously many challenging moments on set.\"Especially, with the way that Jimmy did it, the couple of the scenes at the end, we show the alternate reality,\" she elaborates.\"So, sometimes, Toheeb and I would be laughing... like, we were filming when he walks me home after our first date, and we were having a great time, and then Terry our director said to us, OK, now Toheeb, go stand over there and Julia were going to film you walking alone.\"\"And then it hits you like a wave... That was quite dficult.\"The show is coming out at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement. Following the shocking death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May - which was caught on camera - protests against racism and police brutality have taken place across the UK.\"It feeds into the conversations that people are having at the moment about the bizarre nature of racism and Anthony really highlights for me how nobody wins,\" notes Welsh star Rakie Ayola, who portrays Gee, and is best known for her role in Holby City.\"Obviously Anthonys family dont win but the people who killed him dont gain anything. They dont gain so much as a pound coin from what they do.\"There was no reason at all to kill that young man. It wasnt to take his wallet, his phone, which is ridiculous enough. There is something so pointless about putting your energy into any kind of hatred in that way.\"So,youre of a mind to not quite understand why everyone is up in arms about this racism thing, well here you go.\"But it also means that we will take a lot of heat from people who are bored with the racism conversation right now.\"Does Jimoh think things have changed for him, as a young black man, in the  years since Anthonys death \"Of course things have changed and moved forward - but we still have a huge way to go,\" he says.\"Whats interesting now is that the climate has shted a little and everyone is reimagining their relationship with race.\"As a country, thats important and a huge step forward, but nowhere near enough has happened yet.\"Even though she describes her daughters as \"home-bodies\", Ayola confides she has been having more blunt conversations with them, about \"being careful, why other people need to be careful\", since the death of George Floyd.\"Thats been interesting as a parent, explaining whats gone on and trying not to terry them,\" she adds.\"Theres still a lot of work to do, as what happened to Anthony could still happen again tomorrow.\"Anthony airs on BBC One on Monday, .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"books-peter-geoghegan-dark-money-reshaped-political-agenda","story":"Peter GeogheganHead of Zeus, pound.Review by Fiona RintoulON reaching chapter four of Peter Geogheganrsquos meticulously researched and highly readable new book Democracy for Sale: Dark Money and Dirty Politics, I emitted a small scream of ldquoNo!. Irsquod just learnt that ldquothe most blatant example of dark money in recent electoral politics can be traced to the south Glasgow suburb of Clarkston.The poundk-plus that the Democratic Unionist Partyspent on pro-Brexit advertising in the run up to the June  referendum on the UKrsquos membership of the European Union ndash not in Northern Ireland but Great Britain ndash was donated by an obscure body named the Constitutional Research Council . Its only named director was Richard Cook, a multiply-failed Tory candidate of Clarkston parish.This incident is totemic of the tawdry tale of secretive donors and anonymous propaganda that Geoghegan, investigations editor at independent media  openDemocracy and founder of the award-winning investigative website The Ferret, painstakingly weaves in Democracy for Sale. There are a few diamond mines and Russian ambassadors, itrsquos true, but in the main this story unfolds in unstimulating locales and features compromised mediocrities such as Cook.His business interests are nearly as convoluted as those of Arron Banks, one of the self-proclaimed ldquoBad Boys of Brexit. Drawing on the resources of a miasma of offshore companies, Banks bankrolled the belligerent, anti-immigration Leave.EU campaign with the ldquobiggest donation in British political history.The National Crime Agency investigated Banksrsquo pound.m donation to anti-EU causes amid mounting speculation about the source of the funds, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. Banks hailed the ruling as vindication of his Brexit campaign, but others saw it as ldquotacit acceptance that companies in offshore jurisdictions could underwrite political donations.The campaign for Brexit mingled such offshore money with obscure onshore funding. The CRCrsquos donation to the DUP encapsulates the problem. The CRC is an unincorporated association, not subject to the normal disclosure requirements that an incorporated company must meet. According to Geoghegan, unincorporated associations are ldquoblack boxes that can be set up for the sole purpose of funnelling money to political campaigns, with little or no transparency.The influential European Research Groupis also an unincorporated association. Geoghegan shows how the ERG, a party within a party that ldquobrought down a Conservative prime minister and called the tune on Brexit, was able to trouser around pound, in taxpayer money between  and  ldquothanks to a little-used Westminster convention. Another scream moment.The tale of how dark money reshaped the political agenda in the UK and beyond pullulates with such dim-lit legal entities. The same people and companies ndash Cambridge Analytica, Dominic Cummings, Nigel Farage ndash keep reappearing from the mists of an opaque complex of vested interests.Geoghegan claries that he does not believe Brexit was ldquosome grand conspiracy. The British state and the political and business establishment were behind Remain. Instead, he says, the referendum and its aftermath reveal something more fundamental and systemic: ldquoa broken political system that is ripe for exploitation.Arguably, the groundwork for Brexit ndash and for Donald Trump and Boris Johnsonrsquos victories at the ballot box ndash was laid by another brand of unaccountable entity: the think tank. In theory, think tanks do research and publish research papers in practice, says Geoghegan, ldquoWords like lsquoinstitutersquo and lsquocentrersquo give an appearance of academic rigour to what is essentially paid-for lobbying.In the book, Geoghegan illuminates a network of libertarian think tanks that have sought to shunt the political agenda to the right in the UK and the US. Of course, there are left-leaning think tanks too, but, as Geoghegan notes, they are generally more transparent about their funding, as they rely on public money and donations from trusts.Anonymous funding makes think tanks the ideal vehicle for business interests to influence government policy beneath the radar. Geoghegan shows how a ldquotiny group of American plutocrats invested billions in think tanks, universities and election campaigns over the last four decades. ldquoBefore this methodical and precisely targeted spending spree, libertarians had been largely thought of as cranks, he writes. ldquoAfterwards, the limited space within which policies are created and publicly discussed was filled with proposals that they wanted.The ldquogrande dame of libertarian think tanks is the Institute for Economic Affairsin London. Geoghegan reveals how the IEArsquos ldquosunny analysis about Brexit and unprecedented access to ministers helped determine the UK governmentrsquos course after the referendum. The IEA also worked to promote the idea of the Anglosphere in the UK ndash a union of English-speaking people as a bulwark against Brussels bureaucrats first mooted by Margaret Thatcher in .Democracy for Sale appears just as the UK government publishes its long-awaited report into alleged Russian interference in UK politics. Geoghegan touches on Russian influence in the UK and beyond, but the bulk of the dark money and misinformation that he documents sits much closer to home.ldquoHiding in plain sight is a phrase that recurs throughout this book. The ultimate source of the money donated to the DUP by the CRC in the run-up to the EU referendum was protected not by cloak-and-dagger Brexiteers but by Northern Irish legislation. Subsequent Electoral Commission inquiries into the donation proved toothless. ldquoThe system is broken, and nobody intends to fix it, transparency activist Tamasin Cave tells Geoghegan.In ldquothe digital Wild West, accountability is in even shorter supply. Geoghegan conjures a blizzard of examples of the disturbing ways in which digital campaigning can be used to undermine democratic mechanisms, from targeted messaging to voter suppression.In this shadowy world, truth is the first casualty. During the  general election campaign, the Conservative Party rebranded its Twitter account as FactcheckUK with no consequences. However, all the blame for the increasing role of unregulated digital campaigning in our politics cannot be laid at the door of right-wing parties. Barack Obama was one of the first to harness its power.Written in crisp, vivid prose, Democracy for Sale is a dense but compelling narrative that takes us from the backstreets of Washington DC to Viktor Orbagravenrsquos Hungary. Above all, it is a call to arms, and everyone who is concerned about our democracy should read it.While Geoghegan remains an optimist, he does not hide the scale or urgency of the challenge. ldquoLike the climate, democracy is fast reaching a tipping point, he warns."},{"url":null,"title":"new-favourite-podcast-rule-three","story":"Rule Of ThreeStrange title.

He saw it dferently, calling her interventions ldquointolerable.The Thatcher-Major tussle was something of an exception, with most past leaders taking care not to criticise from the sidelines.

I hope I win the lottery on Saturday but that doesnt mean it is going to happen.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, was a hasty addition to the line-up. On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

With more than one million Scots having been furloughed and think tanks making dire economic forecasts for the retail, hospitality, and tourism sector, the reality is more likely to be a tsunami of redundancies once the UK Government pulls the plug on its financial support schemes. The bounce back, as they say in stock markets, may be more like a dead cat bouncing.It would, therefore, be premature for the Scottish Government to even begin thinking about repealing the emergency measures introduced at the beginning of this crisis to help Scots struggling financially with this crisis.This includes the measures that were taken to extend protection for people from Sherf Officers from  days to six months, when they used Scotlandrsquos statutory moratorium procedure for debt. It also includes the decision to require landlords to give six monthsrsquo notice before initiating court action for rent arrears and includes the steps to waive bankruptcy application fees for those in most need.However, unless the Scottish Government acts, all these measures will be repealed on the th September , when the sunset clause for the CoronavirusActs No  and No  come into effect.To allow this to occur now would be financially calamitous for many. As we have seen from previous economic downturns, financial fallout is often a lagging effect of an economic crises and often comes later: not when the events leading to it occur. This will particularly be the case with this one.The last thing the Scottish Government should be doing now is pulling away the safety net from those people it was intended to help.In fact, there is a stronger case to be made that this is the time to strengthen that net and even extend its reach to provide greater protection for those most vulnerable.Already the UKrsquos large debt and homelessness charities, such as Shelter and Citizen Advice are lobbying the UK Government to take further steps to protect tenants and the UK Government has now laid regulations for their own debt Breathing Space Schemes in England and Wales, which will commence next year. Both of which are far more reaching than anything we have in Scotland.They not only protect people from bailfs but freeze interest and charges on debts and prevent evictions and repossessions. They also include specic measures to help those struggling with a mental health crisisthey are receiving help from mental health professionals. In Scotland we have no such comparative measures.It may well be, that even in those areas where the Scottish Parliament has the power to make a dference, the UK Government may now go further in introducing protections for the most vulnerable.We can only hope that the Scottish Government now focus on the financial fallout from this crisis and use the full powers of the Parliament to not repeal the measures they introduced, but extend them to March , and introduce more permanent measures in their place.If it does not, it is not legal powers they lack, but political will.Alan McIntosh is a money adviser.

It is the number of wealth in Hinduism, the number of gates of heaven in Islam, and is a lucky number in China and Japan, also because of its mythological connection to prosperity.And today I am going to make my case for the power of eight for Scottish unionism, a bedraggled concept which appears in slow decline. There should be no inevitability about this, however, and indeed I would suggest that they may find their own form of prosperity should they follow these eight simple rules. - Understand where you are and why yoursquore thereIn considering the narrative of last weekrsquos visit by Boris Johnson, which was presumably pre-briefed by Downing Street, one would be forgiven for thinking that nobody in the Prime Ministerrsquos operation has seen any of the news which has emanated from Scotland over the last  years. To suddenly be plunged into apparent lsquopanic modersquo is to misunderstand unionismrsquos position. Unionismrsquos deficit has been coming for years. Indeed, far from being a resounding victory, it looks increasingly as though the  referendum simply came early enough on the x-axis for unionism to survive. But unionism is not in the doldrums because of any irresistible pull-factor inherent in Scottish nationalism rather, there is a signicant push-factor involved. Unionism is stuck in an unappealing, perpetual panic, reacting to everything, offering nothing positive. SNP wins an election unionists create the Calman Commission. Yes almost wins the referendum unionists create the Vow and the Smith Commission. It is a humiliating lack of thought, understanding and planning all rolled into one. - Be less emotionalI appreciate I am in the minority as someone who does not feel particularly nationalistic or patriotic, either towards Britain or Scotland, however unionistsrsquo emotional, sometimes rather hysterical, obsession with lsquoour precious unionrsquo is preventing sensible decision making. Too many unionists exude the air of people who are confused and embittered that the general population doesnrsquot share their unrequited love. A more clinical approach, which is much more characteristic of nationalist leaders, would create the space for far more sensible decision making.: Nicola Sturgeon facing questions over her knowledge of Alex Salmond probe - Stop visiting Scotland to lsquosave the unionrsquoThis is a foolish endeavour for a number of reasons, but most obviously it underlines the fact that members of the Cabinet seldom come to Scotland, a part of the UK which they have just as much right to visit as anywhere , including England. Cabinet visits would be far less controversial, more normal indeed,they happened more often. - Stop talking Scotland downUnionists think this is a nationalist trope, but they are wrong: the tone of unionist communications is counterproductive and corrosive. Coronavirus has turbocharged the temptation to revert to this approach, and the notion that an independent Scotland could not have afforded furlough and a range of other measures is now a centrepiece of unionist messaging. It is, of course, nonsense, and while an independent Scotland would inevitably face uncertainty in its initial years, there is no reason to expect that it would not rapidly develop the ideological maturity to create a wealthy country.:Michael Gove not distracted by independence support surge as devolution key to union case - Stop doing the nationalistsrsquo work for themA great deal of unionist action plays directly into the hands of nationalism. Because of the raw emotion , Unionists tend to define victory as denying the SNP something that it wants, without understanding that this plays perfectly into the nationalist narrative. The prime example of this, which is coming at unionists like a herd of buffalo, is the current policy of saying no to a second independence referendum, evenit is secured with a majority of seats, perhaps even votes, on a clear manesto commitment. Unionists may see this as a clever tactic which puts Nicola Sturgeon in a hole, but in the medium- to long-term it is an appalling strategy which pushes soft unionists, dismayed at the denial of democracy, to the other side. - Get Brexit doneBy default, we consider Brexit to push Scotland towards independence, but in fact a swt Brexit with a reasonable deal has a good chance of becoming a positive for unionism. I voted Remain, but despite this I expect the outcome of Brexit to be signicantly less damaging than doomsayers predict, and this, coated in the toxic prospect of a customs border between Scotland and England should an independent Scotland rejoin the EUrsquos Customs Union, may well flip the Brexit issue from the nationalist column to the unionist one. - Do moreFor a group of people who are so ostensibly passionate about keeping Scotland in the union, the UK Government is prone to leaving the field of play empty for the Scottish Government to roam free. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack and his team appear to understand the pitfalls of this better than their predecessors, but much of the damage has been done. Unionists should be bolder about planting their flag on Scottish turf, including in devolved competencies, especially when theyrsquove paid for the flagpole ndash a practice which is considered normal in federal countries. - Finally, itrsquos time for a New UnionUnionists are always chasing the curve reacting, panicking, misstepping. They need to make a calm, clinical analysis of where the people of the nations of the UK want to be in  years, and create a positive, proactive vision of a New Unionism which takes us all there. It is, in my view, highly likely to involve both more muscular unionismas well as an enhancement of devolved powers. They can call this federalism, or any other of the myriad terms people use for it ndash it is what it is. But whatever they call it, unionists should understand that New Unionism has a real chance of appealing to many of the soft centrists whom they have pushed towards nationalism. Without it, they will almost certainly lose the next independence referendum.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"album-review-royal-scottish-national-orchestra-rcs-voices-jean-luc-tingaud-cesar-franck","story":"Cesar Franck ndash Le Chausseur Maudit Psyche Les EolidesFive years ago the orchestra teamed up with another French conductor, Jean-Luc Tingaud, for a Naxos disc of a symphony and other works by Vincent DrsquoIndy and now the same team has turned its attention to the under-appreciated catalogue of his teacher, Cesar Franck.

For all the thuggery and kleptocracy of Mr Putinrsquos rule, his legitimacy remains tied to the idea of public support.His popularity is a mix of genuine loyalty and apathy, with roots in the early s oil boom which lted millions out of poverty.It was the beginning of a social contract that provided economic growth and stability, but indemanded the population turn a blind eye to the de-politicisation of public le.Voting became an act of theatre, the Kremlin deploying lsquogovernment resourcesrsquo ndash propaganda, coercion, manipulation ndash to make sure Mr Putinrsquos validity could not be questioned.As growth stalled a new conservative narrative emerged which continues to dominated politics today.In it, the Kremlin portrays Mr Putin as the only capable defender of a Russia besieged by internal and external enemies.The success of this narrative is waning. Most Russians care about schools, roads and hospitals. Others about the environment, internet freedoms and pensions.They want someone to tackle poor infrastructure, rising utility bills and unchecked corruption.These issues have spawned protests across the country. Some have remained local and apolitical. Others have become about power and accountability.Either way the increase in protests point to risingnot disparate civic activism amongst parts of the population the Kremlin needs to keep onside. The more these grievances are seen as consequences of Mr Putinrsquos rule, the harder it becomes for the president to avoid responsibility.Next is the elite. It is not just legitimacy derived from the public that Mr Putin relies on ndash he also needs the support of those in power around him.The presidentrsquos system is dominated by a handful of political, financial and industry figures who have accumulated interests and assets they want to protect.When this collides with structures that prevent traditional transfers of power, you get a succession problem. Indeed, the last few years has seen infighting bubble to the surface as elites jostle to best position themselves for a potential post-Putin world.Power struggles have played out in boardrooms and across the court system.How do you pass on a personalised system with no checks and balances  Who do you trust For now Mr Putinrsquos response to these questions has been to bury speculation by allowing himself to rule for another two terms. This is unlikely to assuage the worries of the elite in the long term.There remains no clear plan for Russiarsquos future.Then there is the economy. Despite often being described as close to collapse, it has shown itself to be resilient thanks to a well managed central bank and focus on macroeconomic stability.Years of sanction-induced isolation has helped Moscow prepare for financial shocks. But the economy remains vulnerable and has long suffered from stagnation ndasha result of the political decision to prioritise control over growth.Covid- has exacerbated these concerns, plunging the economy into deep recession. While the government has rolled out a stimulus package the response has been slow, and the worry is it wonrsquot be enough.Russiarsquos business ombudsman reported in May that  per cent of companies may struggle to survive. The economy could contract by as much as six percent this year.To make matters worse, the pandemic has come on the back of a price crash and drop in demand for oil, Russiarsquos main export earner.It may take years for consumption to rebound.Any recovery will be complicated by market shts towards decarbonisation and cheaper renewables.The Kremlin will likely find itself relying more on China but increased dependency will bring risks.To properly future-proof its economy Moscow will need to not only welcome innovation and ersication but also a fundamental restructure of a system long resistant to change."},{"url":null,"title":"stunning-570k-airdrie-mansion-sauna-grabs-2-50-raffle-competition","story":"The concept is simple ndash anyone over the age of  can enter the competition by answering one question, paying the pound. entry fee, and a winner is drawn using a number generating algorithm.The cap for ticket entrants is set at , tickets before the planned draw.Thiswas meantto take place in March, but has been postponed to December as a result of the coronavirus.Philip Leckie, who lived in the five-bedroom detached house at  AlexanderStreet, Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, for nearly a decade, has received interest from across the globe with his alternative and ldquomore creative way to pass on the property to a new owner.He said:ldquoWe got surveyors in who said it was worth around pound, ndash but wersquod be lucky to get pound, for it, maybe less.ldquoI thought to myself, lsquothere must be another way of doing thisrsquo.It was at that point that Philip came up with the idea of holding a competition ndash and is even planning to donate a large portion of the money raised to Airdriersquos local St Andrewrsquos Hospice.The home includes a sauna,large lounge, conservatory, sun lounge and full attic space.There is also a detached garage with a driveway fit for multiple cars.He continued: ldquoMy grandshyfather died in St Andrewrsquos Hospice about  years ago, and the hospice staff were always more than helpful ndash not just for my grandfather but for the entire family.ldquoThey are just amazing, even seeing the way they cared for Fernando Ricksen in his final months was incredible and inspiring.

Irsquod just learnt that ldquothe most blatant example of dark money in recent electoral politics can be traced to the south Glasgow suburb of Clarkston.The poundk-plus that the Democratic Unionist Partyspent on pro-Brexit advertising in the run up to the June  referendum on the UKrsquos membership of the European Union ndash not in Northern Ireland but Great Britain ndash was donated by an obscure body named the Constitutional Research Council . Its only named director was Richard Cook, a multiply-failed Tory candidate of Clarkston parish.This incident is totemic of the tawdry tale of secretive donors and anonymous propaganda that Geoghegan, investigations editor at independent media  openDemocracy and founder of the award-winning investigative website The Ferret, painstakingly weaves in Democracy for Sale. There are a few diamond mines and Russian ambassadors, itrsquos true, but in the main this story unfolds in unstimulating locales and features compromised mediocrities such as Cook.His business interests are nearly as convoluted as those of Arron Banks, one of the self-proclaimed ldquoBad Boys of Brexit. Drawing on the resources of a miasma of offshore companies, Banks bankrolled the belligerent, anti-immigration Leave.EU campaign with the ldquobiggest donation in British political history.The National Crime Agency investigated Banksrsquo pound.m donation to anti-EU causes amid mounting speculation about the source of the funds, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. Banks hailed the ruling as vindication of his Brexit campaign, but others saw it as ldquotacit acceptance that companies in offshore jurisdictions could underwrite political donations.The campaign for Brexit mingled such offshore money with obscure onshore funding. The CRCrsquos donation to the DUP encapsulates the problem. The CRC is an unincorporated association, not subject to the normal disclosure requirements that an incorporated company must meet. According to Geoghegan, unincorporated associations are ldquoblack boxes that can be set up for the sole purpose of funnelling money to political campaigns, with little or no transparency.The influential European Research Groupis also an unincorporated association. Geoghegan shows how the ERG, a party within a party that ldquobrought down a Conservative prime minister and called the tune on Brexit, was able to trouser around pound, in taxpayer money between  and  ldquothanks to a little-used Westminster convention. Another scream moment.The tale of how dark money reshaped the political agenda in the UK and beyond pullulates with such dim-lit legal entities. The same people and companies ndash Cambridge Analytica, Dominic Cummings, Nigel Farage ndash keep reappearing from the mists of an opaque complex of vested interests.Geoghegan claries that he does not believe Brexit was ldquosome grand conspiracy. The British state and the political and business establishment were behind Remain. Instead, he says, the referendum and its aftermath reveal something more fundamental and systemic: ldquoa broken political system that is ripe for exploitation.Arguably, the groundwork for Brexit ndash and for Donald Trump and Boris Johnsonrsquos victories at the ballot box ndash was laid by another brand of unaccountable entity: the think tank. In theory, think tanks do research and publish research papers in practice, says Geoghegan, ldquoWords like lsquoinstitutersquo and lsquocentrersquo give an appearance of academic rigour to what is essentially paid-for lobbying.In the book, Geoghegan illuminates a network of libertarian think tanks that have sought to shunt the political agenda to the right in the UK and the US. Of course, there are left-leaning think tanks too, but, as Geoghegan notes, they are generally more transparent about their funding, as they rely on public money and donations from trusts.Anonymous funding makes think tanks the ideal vehicle for business interests to influence government policy beneath the radar. Geoghegan shows how a ldquotiny group of American plutocrats invested billions in think tanks, universities and election campaigns over the last four decades. ldquoBefore this methodical and precisely targeted spending spree, libertarians had been largely thought of as cranks, he writes. ldquoAfterwards, the limited space within which policies are created and publicly discussed was filled with proposals that they wanted.The ldquogrande dame of libertarian think tanks is the Institute for Economic Affairsin London. Geoghegan reveals how the IEArsquos ldquosunny analysis about Brexit and unprecedented access to ministers helped determine the UK governmentrsquos course after the referendum. The IEA also worked to promote the idea of the Anglosphere in the UK ndash a union of English-speaking people as a bulwark against Brussels bureaucrats first mooted by Margaret Thatcher in .Democracy for Sale appears just as the UK government publishes its long-awaited report into alleged Russian interference in UK politics. Geoghegan touches on Russian influence in the UK and beyond, but the bulk of the dark money and misinformation that he documents sits much closer to home.ldquoHiding in plain sight is a phrase that recurs throughout this book. The ultimate source of the money donated to the DUP by the CRC in the run-up to the EU referendum was protected not by cloak-and-dagger Brexiteers but by Northern Irish legislation. Subsequent Electoral Commission inquiries into the donation proved toothless. ldquoThe system is broken, and nobody intends to fix it, transparency activist Tamasin Cave tells Geoghegan.In ldquothe digital Wild West, accountability is in even shorter supply. Geoghegan conjures a blizzard of examples of the disturbing ways in which digital campaigning can be used to undermine democratic mechanisms, from targeted messaging to voter suppression.In this shadowy world, truth is the first casualty. During the  general election campaign, the Conservative Party rebranded its Twitter account as FactcheckUK with no consequences. However, all the blame for the increasing role of unregulated digital campaigning in our politics cannot be laid at the door of right-wing parties. Barack Obama was one of the first to harness its power.Written in crisp, vivid prose, Democracy for Sale is a dense but compelling narrative that takes us from the backstreets of Washington DC to Viktor Orbagravenrsquos Hungary. Above all, it is a call to arms, and everyone who is concerned about our democracy should read it.While Geoghegan remains an optimist, he does not hide the scale or urgency of the challenge. ldquoLike the climate, democracy is fast reaching a tipping point, he warns."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-kirsty-hughes-time-scottish-politics-move-constitutional-divide","story":"Butitrsquos a question of when, not , another vote will happen, wouldnrsquot it be good to get it over with quickly  Scotlandrsquos politics may look relatively normal compared to the extraordinary trajectory of the UKrsquos politics in recent years. But itrsquos not that normal, or that healthy, when the dominant issue in politics is essentially a permanent campaign to which most  is subsumed .:Eight simple rules to help unionists start winningOf course, with ldquoyes ahead in the polls, and Johnson in office, itrsquos the pro-independence side that would grab the chance of an early voteit could. But the unionist side might consider where things will be in early . The economic impacts of the Covid crisis will still be strongly felt then , and ndash it has to be hoped ndash the health impacts will be much more under control.Some independence supporters might prefer a slower path ndash building support to % and more, working up the policy arguments. And many unionists doubtless hope that putting it off for several years will, somehow, lead to a sea-change in opinion.But, in the end, a politics of constant campaigning has some real downsides, whichever side yoursquore on. For a start, it means a mostly very inward-looking and a very process-driven debate. Is the Union a great thing or on its last legs  Does the Scottish Government have a democratic mandate to hold another vote  How badly is devolution maling  Would any Plan B work  And so on.True, the SNP policy of independence in the EU means some attention is paid to European issues ndash mainly to the key independence questions of whether, under what conditions and how quickly an independent Scotland could join the EU. But how many times does the same ground need to be gone over . Circular debate on the same issues is the inevitable outcome of a permanent but unresolved constitutional ide.Meanwhile, bigger issues of the European green deal, the massive new Covid recovery fund and future EU budget deal, the EUrsquos failures on the refugees and migration front, its populist and rule of law challenges, are all rather far from most Scottish political and policy debate. Beyond the EU, the current state of global power politics was parlous and deeply troubling even before the Covid- crisis. Whether as part of the UK, or as an independent Scotland in the EU, these global challenges need serious debate.And,Scotland does choose independence, then the process of becoming a well-established, mature independent state will take time. Itrsquos not only a question of the transitions from the UK and into the EU but a question of active, long-term state-building.And , contrary to current polls, Scotland chose to stay in the UK, then political time could be used to push for a more positive transformation of the Union rather than the catalogue of destructive errors currently emanating out of London. Resolving the constitutional debate quickly would free up time for such vital issues.But, of course, democratic politics doesnrsquot work that way. Democracy takes time. The UK and Scottish governments will continue their stand-off over another referendum SNP infighting over tactics will doubtless continue and opposition parties will carry on inveighing against independence. And, while the constitutional issue is at the core of Scottish politics, then it will be a politics dominated by a rather inward-looking debate.:BBC Executive Complaints Unit issue ruling over Sarah Smith report on Nicola SturgeonBut the world is in a deeply unstable state and it would behove both sides of the independence ide to spend more time engaging with those wider challenges.Scotlandrsquos politics, given the constitutional ide, is inevitably stuck in a repetitive campaigning state.

According to NHS Orkney#s interim chief executive, Michael Dickson, this is because the new positive test was conducted by an industrial lab which had not been validated by the NHS.The inidual, who is not currently in Orkney — but has been in the county during the past week — has been asked to self-isolated. This person will be immediately re-tested by the nearest NHS veried lab — the Lighthouse Lab in Glasgow.  In the meantime, NHS Orkney will be tracing iniduals that the person in question has come into signicant contact with.It should be confirmed within the next three days whether this is indeed a new test-positive case — the tenth for Orkney,so.Mr Dickson said: #A number of industries use labs to undertake COVID swab tests and this labs are not validated by the NHS.#We can#t be confident that,the same test had been done in an NHS lab, it would have achieved the same result.#The interim chief executive, who is the permanent chief executive for NHS Shetland, explained that there had been a similar issue with a possible case within his home board. He added that, like in Shetland, he would be working to see whether some industries which have been testing their staff for the virus could do so through an NHS veried lab.#What we do is presume the person is positive,# Mr Dickson continued.#We kick in all the our well-rehearsed contact-tracing mechanisms and we instruct the person to self-isolate where they are.#When this happened in Shetland, the second test came back negative. It#s dficult, but we have to err by the side of caution.#Mr Dickson said that he understood that there would be an element of anxiety around this new possible case, and advised that all those who have come into signicant contact with the inidual in question will be contacted and asked to self-isolate for  days. If a contact is in a high risk category, a decision may be taken to immediately test them for coronavirus.It is not knownthis case will be included in NHS Orkney’s positive COVID cases as the original lab is not an NHS facility.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

The humourous bit was that he was supposed to have spoken Irish with a German accent.I vill not be tempted to ask vot is dis curried yoghurt mein herr.In  Mr Campbell was barred from addressing the Northern Ireland Assembly for a day after making similar remarks at Stormont.He began an address to the assembly with Curry my yoghurt can coca coalyer.He was aping the Irish go raibh maith agat, Ceann Comhairle, which translates as thank you, Speaker and is used by some MLAs in the chamber.Mr Campbell refused to apologise for his words in  and was criticised by then Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin for a breach of standards.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGregory Campbell posted the comment on his Facebook page.There#s has been anger over his latest comments on social media. While many under his post commented with laughing emojis others asked why he thought he should mock the language.Sinn Fein MLA Emma Sheerin said Mr Campbell was attempting to mock the Irish language and identity with the post.“Comments posted on social media by DUP MP Gregory Campbell attempting to mock the Irish language and identity are crass, offensive and despicable, The Mid Ulster MLA said“Sadly, this is not the first time Gregory Campbell has insulted the Irish language community with his offensive anti-Irish mockery, these comments are reminiscent of .“When the Assembly was restored in January, DUP leader Arlene Foster said identities should be respected. Perhaps Gregory Campbell needs to reflect on the words of his party leader.“It is long past the time that disrespect like this is allowed to go unchallenged and time the DUP genuinely embraced equality and respect.”The DUP has been approached for comment. SDLP MLA Cara Hunter called for Mr Campbell to apologise for the comments. “This is not the first time that Gregory Campbell MP has made crass and offensive comments of this nature, which are intended to insult the Irish language community, the East Londonderry MLA said. It is not the first time and likely not the last time. However, as unsurprising as these comments are, it is important that they are challenged.”“Gregory Campbell should remember that he was recently re-elected to serve the whole community, right across East Derry. He should apologise for these hurtful remarks and reflect on his tone going forward.”Belfast Most ReadCommunity in shock after two men and a woman killed in Portglenone crashDUP#s Gregory Campbell accused of mocking Irish language after #crass and despicable# social media postThree dead from same family: Kilrea husband, we and brother victims of horric crashActivists #evict# Far-Right Irish party as it sets up stall in centre of BelfastCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive to examine support for those facing quarantine afterfrom Spain,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I found them very professional and confidential and the end result was that I met my partner Paula, he said. Having found his own perfect match, Paul is keen to help other men in the same position and is applying  years worth of skills in business ownership, management, customer care and relationship building to help in their search for the one.He#ll also be helping men become Mr Right, and his advice will be more vital than ever for clients anxious about the daunting prospect of going back to face-to-face dates post-lockdown.Given my own positive experience I felt that I could offer a lot to the company in terms of seeing things from a man#s perspective. I#ve been single, married, separated and met the new love of my le, so I#ve experienced it all, Paul said. If a person of my age can meet someone new, it shows that le is certainly not over and that there#s hopefully a match for everyone. I#ll take them under my wing, talk them through the process, answer any questions and calm their fear, which is always the biggest thing holding people back.

The one to Mr McAdam ly quotes him as telling a newspaper: At first I was opposed to the initiative. However, when I saw the preparation, the community backing, and some  volunteers, I thought I needed to revisit the idea.The letter to Mr Goggin takes the form of a press release to all media outlets in Belfast. It ly quotes him as expressing delight at supporting Open Ormeau. It then goes on to quote two real-le disabled customers of his - a female wheelchair user and a partially sighted male - backing the initiative.Mr Goggin said: It#s a sinister letter which I regard as an attempt to intimidate myself and my  staff and to undermine and discredit my position.All I am doing is trying to save the business I have worked hard to build up over  years.Whoever sent this letter may see me as a #wee greengrocer# whom they can silence. They are wrong.Mr McAdam said: When I spoke out against Open Ormeau, I never expected anything like this. I believe this letter is designed to intimidate me from airing my views. Those behind it won#t succeed, but I#ve a young family and the whole experience has left me very worried and stressed about the impact on them.The hand-writing on both envelopes was dferent, and the letters inside were typed. From examining the correspondence, the businessmen believe that at least three people were involved.DUP MLA Christopher Stalford said: These are sinister letters. Michael and Fergal should not have to put up with action like this because they dared to express their concerns about potential dangers to their businesses. This is supposed to be a community conversation but it seems there are some people who aren#t prepared to simply agree to disagree with others.SDLP councillor Gary McKeown said: I absolutely condemn any attempt by anyone to shut down the conversation and make people feel unable to share their views about the project.Anyone for or against must be able to comment freely. It is only through dialogue that we can reach common ground.Open Ormeau initially hoped to close the road to traffic during every summer weekend. It has been strongly backed by local pubs and restaurants. But in light of opposition from many other businesses - worried about a fall in trade - the plans have been reduced to only some weekend days in August.The new proposals will be discussed by Belfast City Council#s strategic policy and resources committee on Friday. The DUP opposes the plan. If Sinn Fein also fails to back it, the initiative will fail.Mr Goggin said he was so worried that the proposals would close his business that he has written to First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill. The Belfasthas contacted Open Ormeau for comment.

Mr Wells, who has had the DUP party whip removed, made the comments during a debate in the Assembly. The GAA rejected his criticism.Defending the remarks on BBC Radio Ulster#s Nolan Show on Tuesday morning, Mr Wells referred to comments made by DUP MLA Edwin Poots while he was the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure in , claiming that the GAA was a cold house for the unionist community.Here we are  years later and there still has been no progress made on making the GAA more inclusive to the whole community, Mr Wells told the Nolan Show. It is .% nationalist.He added: If soccer or rugby was entirely Protestant or Catholic there would be huge questions asked about why vast amounts of public money is being poured into an organisation that has failed to attract people from the other side of the fence as it where. Similar the GAA has done nothing in my opinion to make itself more inclusive and friendly to the Protestant community.They haven#t moved on at all.Mr Wells made the remarks during a debate bout the Executive CommitteeBill on Monday. Critics of the bill say it will reduce areas in which ministers# power is constrained by the Executive as a whole.Mr Wells used the planning decision on Casement Park as an example of how a minister could go on a solo run.Mr Wells told MLAs: Say Sinn Fein decided to spend a vast amount of money, as it could, holding the Department for Communities, on making Casement Park even grander. Read More DUP MLA Jim Wells urged to retract remarks as he brands GAA #sectarian and republican# during debateThat would cause huge concern amongst the unionist community given the sectarian and republican nature of the GAA.Brian McAvoy, chief executive of Ulster GAA, speaking on Radio Ulster#s Good Morning Ulster, said that it was not a surprise that Mr Wells was not the biggest fan of the GAA. He said GAA volunteers had been at the forefront of the community response to the Covid- pandemic. They have been delivering food parcels and delivering pharmaceuticals to our most vulnerable in our communities, he said.I am quite certain we were not asking people their religion or political persuasion before we were knocking on their doors. On this coming Friday, in Croke Park, we have the Muslim festival of Eid taking place. Because of restricted numbers and restricted venues, they have chosen Croke Park to hold this, so I think that shows that we are certainly not sectarian. Sinn Fein#s South Down MLA Sinead Ennis called on Mr Wells to retract his comments as the GAA could not be further from that. Following the debate, SDLP MLA Justin McNulty, a former All-Ireland winner, said there were hundreds of people in GAA clubs across Ireland who have done more to reconcile communities and bring people together than Mr Wells.It is incredibly disappointing that he continues to use isive, offensive language to label our community of volunteers who are working hard, including throughout the pandemic, to support people, he added.Read More DUP#s Gregory Campbell accused of mocking Irish language after #crass and despicable# social media postMeanwhile, the DUP have been challenged to act on comments by DUP MP Gregory Campbell mocking the Irish language.The East Londonderry MP made the remarks on his Facebook page on Sunday in relation to a BBC programme about a suspected Nazi spy who lived in Donegal during the Second World War.He said: I#m informed that BBC  NI had a programme on tonight about a suspected German spy who lived in the RoI during the war. The humourous bit was that he was supposed to have spoken Irish with a German accent.I vill not be tempted to ask vot is dis curried yoghurt mein herr.Sinn Fein labelled the remarks crass and offensive and the SDLP called on Mr Campbell to apologise for his comments.

They called the secretary to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal , which investigates complaints about Government intelligence agencies, and raised concern about reports provided to judges by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner#s Office , which authorises the use of investigatory powers by intelligence agencies. IPT president Lord Justice Singh described what happened as inappropriate said an MI official had written to apologise. Detail of the call, and subsequent correspondence, emerged at an IPT hearing in London yesterday. Four human rights groups - the Belfast-based Committee on the Administration of Justice, the Pat Finucane Centre in Londonderry, Privacy International and Reprieve - are involved in litigation with the Foreign Office, Home Office, Government Communications Headquarters, MI and MI. Last year the four groups asked the IPT to rule that a policy which allows MI to authorise informants to commit serious criminal offences was unlawful. In December, the IPT ruled against them, and the four groups are challenging that decision in the Court of Appeal. They also want an IPT ruling on how the tribunal#s requests for information from IPCO should be dealt with. Two MI staff contacted the IPT secretary in March , Lord Justice Singh said. They said ious inspection reports given to the IPT by IPCO should not have been provided and added that MI had concerns on relation to the material. The IPT secretary wrote to MI saying it was inappropriate for MI to seek to intervene in ongoing legal proceedings in such a way, and an MI official had apologised for any misunderstanding. The direct communication which took place with the tribunal was inappropriate, said Lord Justice Singh at yesterday#s hearing. An apology was given and it was clearly recognised that nothing like this should happen in the future. Everyone now recognises that something had gone wrong. Reprieve director Maya Foa said: MI was right to apologise. Reprieve later released, with the approval of the IPT, redacted copies of letters exchanged between the IPT and MI, which is also known as the Secret Intelligence Service.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry Central Library in Foyle Street is one of just five libraries from across the North which were chosen to be part of a pilot scheme to allow customers back in. Branch Library Manager, Koran Burns, said people were delighted toto the facility, which shut on March . We opened on Thursday and there were people queuing to get in which was great to see, she said. Weve had lots of families coming in and they have told us that they really missed it, especially the Rhythm and Rhyme sessions. googletag.cmd.push  Maisie and Daithi Flood enjoy getting back to the library. Co-Branch Library Manager, Eugene Martin, said the Derry Central Library serves an important social . A lot of our regulars would be older people who really enjoy coming in for a chat, he explained. Previously, they would have come in for a cup of tea and to read the newspapers. They would come in at a particular time knowing their friends would be there. Unfortunately, we have had to take out a lot of seating to allow for social distancing, but this is something we will continue to look at.

We have had a steady stream of visitors at the Central Library since it reopened and people have told us they feel very safe due to all the measures we have introduced. Staff are there to greet people as they come in the door and we have provided hand sanitiser. There are also screens at the desks and lots of customer signage. Any books that are ed will be stored for  hours before they are put back on the shelves. Customers are being asked to keep a social distance and limit their time on the computers or browsing for books to half an hour. There are also self service machines for borrowing books. In addition, all surfaces in the library will be regularly cleaned. We are asking customers to help us keep the computer stations clean by providing sanitising wipes to wipe them down before and after they use them, said Mrs Craig. Staff will also be carrying out a high level of cleaning in the library. Mrs Craig said the opening hours have also been changed to allow the library to close for  hoursbefore reopening on a Tuesday morning for vulnerable people.

The other libraries in Derry, at Strathfoyle, Waterside, Creggan and Shantallow, remain closed at present, but they are offering a Book and Collect service. Customers can phone their local library during dedicated hours to request books and then arrange a suitable time for a contactless collection, explained Mrs Craig. A customer can view our online catalogue and checka particular book they are interested in is available in their local library, they will then phone and speak with a member of staff who will set it aside and arrange a day and time for them to come in and collect it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He will not be able to call on Shane Lagan after the long-serving defenders retirement. Also gone is Conor McGurk who is still in Australia following the coronavirus pandemic. One man who is back in the fold is Paddy Henry, who has played just one game since the clubs  intermediate championship win. Lavey won the minor football and hurling double last season, but due to the young age profile of the team only minor football skipper Cormac Collins and Ryan McGill have graduated to the senior ranks. googletag.cmd.push He acknowledges the work going on around the club, referencing the U success and a useful U group. “From my point of view, I wish they would come through a bit quicker,” McGarvey jokes. While this weekends opponents have been busy with challenge games, Lavey had just Sundays draw with Carrickmore to help their championship preparation. “Thats all we are going to take,” the Lavey boss stressed, rolling out the names of the dual players in his plans. Fintan Bradley, Dara McPeake, Aidan Toner, the McGill brothers , Liam and Colm Murphy. “I envisage  of our team will be dual players. They wont all start on the football team, but they are aiming to play both,” predicts McGarvey, who leads the management team of Simon Wilson, Ben Dodds, Adie McGill and Mark Hearty. googletag.cmd.push “You are not going to know until you start playing. The boys were glad to get out, but we have a tough schedule because nearly all our players are dual players. We were going four or five times a week and we had to cut it back on them.” On the other side of the coin, Dee Doherty is back in charge of Na Magha, eight years after helping them to an Ulster final where they went down to Bredagh. Galway native Tomaacutes Lally, who has transferred from London club St Gabriels, joins him on the management team. “We are trying to build, like other clubs and counties are doing, to try and progress,” said Doherty, who knows the hurling scene well in his role as physio with Derry senior hurlers. “We want to rise up from being Na Magha, the junior team in Derry. It is a game we are looking forward to, with the incentive of it being your first game at home. We know it is Lavey and we know what we are up against.” It will be a chastening experience for his young side, with many of them going straight in against senior clubs in their first year of adult hurling. Many of his squad work in the retail sector, so balancing shts around training has proved dficult. In a  or  day spell Doherty has juggled challenge games with Donegal sides Burt, St Eunans, Setanta and Buncrana. “We have not been able to get the same team out for any of the games,” said Doherty, who was happy to be working with a group of  plus players. “Of that, nine are first year minors and cant play, but we are thinking down the line to next year and the year after. I have never saw numbers like that at Na Magha in my le,” he said. Having their own base is important, but Doherty points to the efforts of Ciaran McCarron and the coaches who have nurtured the upcoming minor squad. “There is a good group of players there that are interested in playing. You are trying to mix them with the older boys. We want to progress into the intermediate level, thats the aim. “For us to win anything this year, we are going to have to beat one of the senior clubs in the county. If we could win one championship game this year, it would be a result for us and that is the target we set out for ourselves.” It will be a long-term project and continuity will be the key. Home advantage will give Na Magha a familiar surrounding, but Lavey should head back down the Glenshane pass with the points. VERDICT: Lavey RELATED- Sean Leos masterclass not enough to clinch Coleraine win.

Ballyhales fabric was well-tested on an afternoon of drama at Paacuteirc Esler. After the game, a relieved Henry Shefflin told reporters his side was put to the pin of their collar, while Michael McShane believed there was still an All-Ireland in the Slaughtneil side. It wont be this season. The GAA omitted the provincial and All-Ireland club competitions from theirto play roadmap. Michael McShane didnt comment on the decision that would prevents his side from defending their title, should they emerge from Derry. googletag.cmd.push “You are only in the position to question thatyou are county champions,” he stated of the GAAs decision. “Like every other year, we just focus on winning Derry, thats the first hurdle. To seewe are good enough to do that and complete eight-in-a-row. If nothing  happens, we will have retained our county title and it will be a good year.” The seeding from last years league placings keeps them apart from a Kevin Lynchs side that have been snapping on their heels in recent seasons. The first challenge is Ballinascreen, who pushed the Lynchs every step of the way in last years championship. It took a late Niall Ferris goal to seal the deal, but it wasnt before a Reece McSorley goal and a point from Aaron Kelly had Screen well in the hunt. googletag.cmd.push Cathal McDaid s as manager, with Danny McGrellis, Hugh Pat Kelly, Michael James Groogan and Dave McGurk in the management team. Their new intake of minors includes Niall Doyle, Ronan McKenna, James O’Connor, Emmett Donnelly and Jamie Murray, but theywill be without the injured Ciaran McBride. The Emmets welcome back Paul McNeill after a -month lay-off with a shoulder injury. Liam Cassidys knee injury has recovered and Prionsias Burke has ed from a year studying in Liverpool. “You wouldve thought he had never been away,” said McShane of McNeills , which will also be welcome news for football boss Paul Bradley. “Hewas just so pleased and happy to get back at it. We are in a good position this year, with Paul, Liam and Prionsias all adding to the strength of the . “You were looking at a summer with nothing, but its great to get back as a group in each others company.” In previous seasons, the Slaughtneil football and hurling training schedule was dependent on the next game and what code needed the immediate focus. This year, both teams are going to continue training when possible during the groups, according McShane, before prioritising ahead of the knock-out stages. “Pauland myself are talking very regularly to keep on top of it, so that we are not overworking the lads.” highlighted McShane, who has retained the same management team that includes Alex Campbell, Noel Brick, Bernard Cassidy, Barney and Patrick McEldowney. “It has all been very good so far. The players are happy and the football management is happy,” he added. The players were upbeat about theirto action after the lay-off,while stressing the importance of players taking responsibility for their own health and checking their temperature regularly in the midst of the training programme. “As the saying goes, you never miss the water til the well runs dry. I hope and pray to God we can get on with it, there will be no issues and we can enjoy a summer of hurling and football like we normally do.” In the world of a condensed season and a raft of dual players, an early win will dilute the importance ofgroupgames further down the track. Its hard to look past an early Slaughtneil victory. VERDICT: Slaughtneil RELATED- Early goals make the dference for Kevin Lynchs.

Attendances have been restricted to a maximum of , depending on the layout of the clubs ground, which includes players from both teams and essential matchday personnel.

It will include two group games, two last  matches, two quarter-finals, both semi-finals and the final. The intermediate and junior finals and the senior hurling decider will all be livestreamed. Bellaghy and Loups game will be followed by the Round  clash of Glen and Magherafelt, a repeat of last seasons decider. googletag.cmd.push As an alternative to the full package, live games can be purchased inidually for a cost of pound. Our Championships in Derry are perennially among the most competitive anywhere in Ireland and our games regularly attract supporters from other counties across Ulster,” commented Derry GAA Chairman Stephen Barker. He felt it was important to maximise access to the club championship during the Covid- crisis. Social distancing will limit the attendance and other vulnerable members of the community, who may be shielding, will not be in a position to attend games. Our hurling and football championships are part of the rhythm of summer and autumn.

He had bad luck when we tried to finish it and it hit the keeper.” Slaughtneil appeared to pull their half forward line deeper to maximise space and on top of Cormac ODohertys - tally, he was picking passes and dictating the game. “I always felt there was an extra  or  percent we could we get out of Cormac,” McShane stated. “This year he has stepped up and we are getting that. “I thought he was fantastic...his vision, his link play and his ability in the rucks to come out with the ball is second to none. He is the new captain of the team, he has that responsibility on his shoulders and he seems to be thriving on it and long may it continue.” RELATED- Slaughtneil ease to opening win of the season.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation. Take a trip with confidence Northern Ireland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. googletag.cmd.push The national tourist organisations of Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation. Summer is here and the United Kingdom is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much-needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. googletag.cmd.push Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation. But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines. Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months. “They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry. “All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. “But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.” Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps. When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book. Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem. Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.  LUXURY STAY: Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey at the Merchant Hotel Relax in five-star luxury Social distancing measures aren’t the only change visitors are experiencing at Belfast’s five-star Merchant Hotel. The hotel has used lockdown time to complete its pound, investment of the Great Room Restaurant and Cocktail Bar. The management team is confident that customers will benefit from, but not be inconvenienced by, the Covid- compliant changes it has also made. The Great Room has been reimagined to create a standalone restaurant and the Cocktail Bar has also benefited from signicant refurbishment. Other venues within the Beannchor Group portfolio have also opened their doors. Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey said: “We’re aware that customers and guests may be curious about the experience that awaits them and, while there are measures in place that follow the scientic guidelines and industry best practice to ensure the safety of our staff and customers at all times, we have striven to minimise the impact to the overall experience at all our venues.” Camping perfect for keeping distance Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond. Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular. middot Wales is open for camping from  July.  Courtesy of Cool Camping Extra measures in place so you can embark on a lakeside holiday Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures. They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner. “There are a lot of positive health implications of being outside and on the water.”  LOCH LOMOND: Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened self-catering properties and cruises For more information on staying safe, please go to www.discovernorthernireland. _CoronavirusPHutm_mediumdisplayutm_sourceMediaForceutm_contentxframingdclidCOvM_IeoCFQzwQodkcEARw\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener\" --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Local playwright Brian Foster recently decided to write a poem about the city, following the positive response when he penned a poem about Creggan where he grew up. .However, he wanted to give people an opportunity to help him write the Derry poem. He started the ball rolling by putting the first line of the poem on to the Memories of Creggan Facebook. He then asked people to come up with ideas for the next line of the poem. Through this process, the poem, entitled My Derry Days, was created. googletag.cmd.push Mr Foster said he was delighted with the response to his initiative. “As far as I’m aware, this is the first time a poem has been written in this online manner by any community anywhere in Ireland. Perhaps even further afield,” he said. “The standard of the entries was so high that the hardest bit was selecting the winning line each night from so many brilliant efforts.” Read more about this story and the finished poem in todays Derry News. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Both Irish Cuip semi-finals – Coleraine vs. Ballymena and Cltonville vs. Glentoran - will be played today at Windsor Park, with the final to be played this Friday.But all such talk of red ribbons on the cup is premature for McLaughlin, who is refusing to look beyond the challenge posed by Mick McDermotts Glens today.“We havent really spoken at all about the final,” McLaughlin stated.“I do know how long its been since the club has won the cup and its crazy to think its been that long because we have had so many great sides down the years. We havent even had that conversation with the players because the sole focus is on Monday.“It will be a really tough game against a good side in Glentoran. Mick McDermott has done a really great job with them and he has them playing well, so it sets it up for a good game, an exciting game. Its a game that we feel we can win, but Im sure Glentoran will be saying the same.” googletag.cmd.push Derry interestThere is a real Derry interest in the last four of the competition this year. With Conor McDermott and Michael McCrudden hoping to help McLaughlin to the trophy this weekend, Glentorans Patrick McClean will have other ideas. For Coleraine, Ben Doherty will be hoping to play a part in a cup final, whilst Joe McCready will be cheering on his team Ballymena from the sidelines as he is cup-tied. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans. First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour. Our next door neighbour, Tommy Armour, is always giving me little bits of advice to help bring the brood along. Recently, it seems to be turning out to more of a community effort to be honest, he said.ldquoAt the beginning of lockdown I missed all my friends, but the farm helped keep me busy.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be a great lover of completing schoolwork at home. I much prefer spending my time tending to my fruit and vegetables and caring for my new chicks.ldquoSometime my little sister, Grace, helps me. She is nine years old and is learning a lot more about farming than I ever thought she would.Aarin added: ldquoI thought the good weather during lockdown helped my vegetables grow. The heat certainly helped.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years. It is a pity that it was left seriously under resourced, facing into a pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Drumaness Superkings have convincing win away to BISC  ","story":"DRUMANESS Superkings played their first match of the shortened T league on Saturday away to BISC.In dficult conditions BISC won the toss and asked Drumaness Superkings to bat.James Cunningham and Ismail opened, but progress was slow and Drumaness Superkings lost their first wicket when Ismail was caught at mid-wicket for  and Cunningham followed caught at slip for .Simon Steele was next man in but with the score on  he was caught for three.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

Kelly Smith was very pleased with . as a new personal best time at that distance.Not to be outdone, Suzy Smith also marked a new PB with . which should really boost her confidence. It seems no time since she was working to break the -minute barrier so real progress has been made by both these runners.In the K there was an ldquoelite race which was the focus for many top athletes as they tested their legs on the flat course and against each other.The race was won by Olympic marathon hopeful and former Jimmyrsquos Ten winner Stephen Scullion in ., to really set a very high standard. His time was over half a minute faster than he ran in the European Championships in Berlin two years ago.Aaron McGrady was th in . mdash not a PB by any means but a solid performance in this time of limbo.Jimmy Sloan has been raring to go since Jimmyrsquos  was called off and he showed himself race fit with a . finish for th place, which was some two minutes  seconds faster than his previous personal best. He was over the moon with this result.The womenrsquos race was won by Ann-Marie McGlynn in a new NI record time of ., with Jessica Craig nd in . and Gemma McDonald third in ..East Downrsquos Hannah Somani, only just missed on a podium place but broke  minutes in . with relative comfort. This was a particularly laudable effort and particularly pleasing for her given that she has only just ed from an injury which prevented her from training for more than two months.ConnemaraCheryl Denvir and Lisa Milligan also deserve a shout out for their weekend exploits. They were in Connemara for the Gaelforce Adventure Race which according to the race brief is a ldquostunning route involving cycling and running through the Inagh Valley, Glen Valley, Maamturk   Ben Mountain ranges, Western Way Trail and kayaking on the crystal clear waters of the Killary Fjord in the shadow of Connaughtrsquos highest mountain Mweelrea. This is Connemara from the inside out. This route with its ied terrain and dramatic views will keep you interested and get you over the line before you know it.I am not sure that they would agree with it being over before they realised mdash the run alone was a mud bath and the cycle was testing to say the least. However both athletes did themselves proud finishing well up the rankings on a tough day out.Over  entered the event and there were a fair number of DNFs. Cheryl finished in th position with a total time of two hours and  minutes. Lisa was home within the three-hour barrier and in the top half of the field, coming th.Even better, she was a clear winner in the F category with her nearest competition more than half an hour behind her Well done you two.The half marathon race was won by the redoubtable Tommy Hughes, aka the lsquoMarrakesh Expressrsquo, in a time of ., which would be a mark most would give their eye teeth to achieve.Given that Tommy is now in the over  age category, it is nothing short of incredible. Well done to him..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Spa Wells group delivers 60 good parcels to residents  ","story":"MEMBERS and volunteers of Spa Wells Cultural Association distributed  food parcels in the area recently.The parcels were delivered to elderly residents and those shielding due to coronavirus.While the lockdown restrictions continue to ease, the association says it is aware that things are still far from normal.A spokesman said distributing food parcels was one small way to help neighbours, relieve social isolation and improve the quality of le of the local community.Residents were grateful to receive non-perishable items and vacuum-packed fresh meat from Poole Butchers.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.Politicians are keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take the lead and ensure that a high class leisure community facility, which has been talked about in the resort for decades, is finally delivered.They insist that the provision of modern accommodation in the heart of Newcastle is long overdue and that the lsquoonce in a generationrsquo opportunity to deliver a modern, indoor facility must not be squandered.Some politicians say it is also critical to maximise every available square inch of space at the site to deliver a high quality centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11615894.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...Introducing the motion, Councillor Sean Clarke said: “I believe the Davagh Dark Sky park contains a number of elements of signicancewhich meet the criteria for designation of a world heritage site.”His party colleague, Councillor Cora Corry described Davagh “as the middle of nowhere and the centre of the universe” and said she would be supportingthe motion.Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Cathal Mallaghan said the work in Davagh over the last number of years has been “pretty spectacular”.“I think this is the next natural step for Davagh to take. Stonehedge is younger than Davagh and you see the signicanceof places like it, so thank-you for the motion Cllr Clarke,” he said.DUP group leader Councillor Paul McLean thanked Councillor Clarke for amending the motion before bringing it to the floor.“My concern is that this is a very costly process and I would just like to see the whole outworkingof the process,” he said.“I believe there will be a lot of officer input. From what I understand it will be a lot of work, it will be good to get our heads around that and seethere is any funding available that can assist us in that process.”UUP Councillor Robert Colvin commended Councillor Clarke for the eloquencewith which he delivered the motion.“I do welcome the word explore becausethe way it was written initially I was concerned Council would have had no more input, this clarication is much appreciated,” said Councillor Colvin.“This exploration has to take into account the livelihood of people in that area and their ability to develop somewhere close to it, we have to think of the here and now.“Having made those comments, as long as that is taken into account, we would support the motion.”SDLP Councillor Kerri Hughes confirmed her party would be supporting the motion and said such recognitionwould really put Davagh and Mid Ulster as a whole “on the map”.Councillor Mark Glasgow said the key to this was going to be “getting the balance right” between protecting the site and allowing the local economy to grow.“From a planning point of view, something could be brought before committee,” said the UUP Councillor. “To ensure we get the right balance that it doesn’t restrict our development plan or business and the further encouragement of tourism in that area.”His party colleague Councillor Walter Cuddy said his initialreaction was that Councillor Clarke was reaching for the stars with this proposal and said he hoped there was no ulterior motive.“We are a bit concerned of the time and effort that could be involved in this and hope it is not for other planning applications nearby thatwe get this into the pipeline it might effect something nearby,” said Cllr Cuddy.“If we can pull it off great but I have serious doubts. The park is not even open yet. I would have thought this would have been good in a year or two’s time when we have something sell and get out there.“That’s why we feel it is maybe a bit too early.”Ulster Unionist Councillor Derek McKinney also expressed concern in relation to planning.“We have just come out of lockdown andthis was to go forward that would put the surrounding area back into lockdown as far as planning was concerned,” said Cllr McKinney.“There is a wider picture to look at here and we need to look at it and see what the consequences may be before we move forward.”Sinn Fein councillor Sean McPeake said that listening to the last few comments he felt people were a bit unnerved by the proposal.“This proposal does not do away with lighting, development can still occur and I think some of the nervousness is .“I place my trust in Councillor Clarke given his passion for the area.”In conclusion Councillor Clarke thanked the chamber for the opportunity to bring the motion forward.“I thought about this for a long time. The dark sky park area is a limited area,” he said.“I thought it was better to keep it compact so that it does not impact on the surrounding community.”The motion received unanimous support in the chamber.Thanking the chamber and describing the motion as a step forward for Mid Ulster, Councillor Clarke invited everyone in the chamber “to come in the near future and see what is there and what we are talking about”.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The specic timings for reopening may y from place to place as owners take assessments and make any necessary changes.ldquoAs we take these cautious steps, no one should make the mistake of thinking the virus has gone away. We could find our hard work quickly undone unless we all go on playing our part, every day, and in every way we can, to keep Wales safe.The Welsh Government has previously asked a number of businesses to begin preparing to reopen from July ,the conditions allow.These are as follows:bull Close contact services, including nail and beauty salons and businesses providing tanning services, massages, body piercings, tattooing, electrolysis or acupuncture.bull Indoor cinemas, museums, galleries and archive services.bull Tourist accommodation with shared facilities, such as camping sites. Opening would be from July .bull Reopening the housing market fully.Provided the reopening of these sectors goes well and conditions allow, indoor opening for pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants will resume from August , following the outcome of the next review of the coronavirus regulations. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable.
