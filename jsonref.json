[{"url":null,"title":"Amazon Fresh joins day delivery service groceries trial south east England","story":"Share this article\u0027Now it\u0027s not going to dominate the UK grocery market any time soon because there\u0027s rather a lot of players in it already who are actually pretty good at what they do. But I think we shouldn\u0027t be under any doubt that they will capture a material slice of this market.\u0027It\u0027s certainly true that when someone with the pockets that are as deep as Amazon enters the market and their existing retail business model doesn\u0027t need to make any profit because they make their profit doing other things, that represents a potential challenge of significant dimensions.\u0027He added: \u0027One of the things we\u0027ve all learned about Amazon over the years is that they are very unconventional and they\u0027re also extraordinarily secretive. So there\u0027s a lot about this that they\u0027ve not told us.\u0027 Amazon release their second quarter results on Thursday. Investors who have seen the share price rise by around 60 per cent this year will be hoping for more good news from the technology giant. The surge in Amazon shares saw founder Jeff Bezos add £10billion to his wealth in just one day last week. Food delivery has doubled in size to more than 3million orders per week since the start of the pandemic as families avoid crowded spaces and learn to shop online. Traditional supermarkets have already seen their market share undercut by German discounters, which hold more than 13 per cent of the UK market, and sellers such as Ocado and Amazon post a threat online. Russell Jones, UK country manager for Amazon Fresh, said: \u0027It\u0027s a really obvious next step to take. Grocery delivery is one of the fastest growing businesses at Amazon and we think this will be one of the most-loved Prime benefits in the UK.\u0027 Tom Brereton, an analyst at Global Data, said: \u0027It\u0027s a bold and ambitious move from Amazon.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Amber Heard joined girl squad night town just hours end Johnny Depp trial","story":"Share this articleWhile Depp was absent yesterday, Heard did attend, and was pictured smiling alongside girlfriend Bianca Butti, before waving at awaiting fans outside the Royal Courts of Justice.  Ms Wass said there was \u0027overwhelming evidence of domestic violence or wife-beating behaviour, cataloged over a three-year period.\u0027 She said Depp was \u0027a hopeless addict who repeatedly lost his self-control and all ability to restrain his anger.\u0027\u0027Permeating all of the evidence in this case is the character of Mr. Depp himself - his well-documented evidence of violence and destruction over his adult life which have occurred when he was under the influence of drink and drugs.\u0027Ms Wass added that Depp \u0027was subject to irrational mood swings and abnormal behavioral patterns, which would not have been present when Mr. Depp was clean and sober, and Mr. Depp has a name for this metamorphosed entity - namely, The Monster.\u0027She said: \u0027The other aspect which is important in terms of substance abuse is Mr Depp\u0027s recollection of his own disgraceful conduct, which is so severely impaired by drug misuse that he may not even have been aware of the extent of his violence and terrifying behaviour which, on more than one of these pleaded incidents, put Ms Heard in fear of her life.\u0027Depp and Heard met on the set of the 2011 comedy \u0027The Rum Diary\u0027 and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for orce the following year, and the orce was finalized in 2017.The former spouses have both been in court during three weeks of testimony at the grand neo-Gothic court building.Ms Wass reminded Mr Justice Nicol there were \u0027well-documented episodes of violence and destruction\u0027 over Depp\u0027s adult life and that the actor had accepted he was violent to inanimate objects but not people.However, she said there was an incident earlier in his career when he assaulted a photographer with a plank of wood when under the influence of drink and drugs.She also said his evidence that he was not violent towards people was \u0027meaningless\u0027 when he was as intoxicated as he was on occasions and \u0027wouldn\u0027t have known what he was doing\u0027.Ms Wass continued: \u0027In answer to what we suggest is overwhelming evidence of domestic violence or wife-beating behaviour, catalogued over a three-year period between 2013 and 2016, Mr Depp\u0027s response is to claim that he is a victim of an elaborate hoax that has been perpetrated against him by Ms Heard and her friends.\u0027The barrister said Depp had accused Heard and her friends of \u0027having painted on injuries, manipulated photographs and destroyed property which they then went on to photograph in order to create what he describes as some sort of insurance policy for Ms Heard\u0027.Ms Wass added: \u0027What exactly Ms Heard was insuring against in the course of this hoax remains unexplained.\u0027She told the court that such a hoax \u0027would have entailed Ms Heard engaging in a pre-planned conspiracy over the period of the entire relationship with Mr Depp\u0027, adding: \u0027Such a suggestion, we say, is risible.\u0027Ms Wass told the court: \u0027The approach taken by Mr Depp from the time Ms Heard obtained a domestic violence restraining order against him on May 27 2016 was as follows: to deny that he ever assaulted Ms Heard, to accuse Ms Heard of being the violent party and to reverse his role with hers.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Joe Bidens speech notes included praiseworthy notes Kamala Harris","story":"Share this articleFalse alarm: Politico \u0027technical error\u0027 identifies Kamala Harris as Biden VP pick"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/0C068B1800000578-5548741-Kate_and_Gerry_McCann_mark_the_fourth_anniversary_of_the_disappe-m-2_1524816157149.jpg","title":"Madeleine McCann investigators resume digging German allotment","story":"Share this articleShare this articleFall Maddie: Polizei setzt Spurensuche in Garten bei Hannover fort"},{"url":null,"title":"Oldham overtakes lockdown Leicester highest second coronavirus infection rate England","story":"Share this articleExplained: What caused Oldham\u0027s new coronavirus crisis, where are the spikes in infection rates and how will the town get out of this? - Manchester Evening NewsManchester Evening News: Number one for news, opinion, sport \u0026amp celebrity gossip"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/113dc93827757c4b3b893cafd2ff650a71b75ea6/0_706_2760_1656/master/2760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e03b352c1642edc125230bba40d551c1","title":"how to host a safe socially distanced barbecue this summer","story":"With lockdown restrictions relaxed, we can safely invite people into our gardens for a slightly adapted style of barbecue. For it to be a successful night, remember it’s all in the planning ... Since coronavirus has shrunk our social spheres, intimate garden parties have become something of a trend. Thanks to street-wide WhatsApp chats and local volunteer groups, eclectic new friendships have been forged – and as the weather’s improved, online quizzes with distant relatives have segued into alfresco drinks with new and nearby friends.While we’re all being urged to stay alert, the easing of lockdown rules means we can meet up with more of our friends. Outside the permitted bubbles in each area, the 2-metre rule remains in place in Scotland and Wales, while iniduals in England and Northern Ireland must stay at least 1 metre apart.But groups of friends can now gather together outside – any sized group from up to two households can meet in Wales up to six people from different households in England, with no limit on people from two different households in Northern Ireland, groups of up to 30 people can meet and in Scotland, up to 15 people from up to five different households can meet outside per day – all while keeping a distance.All of which means summer isn’t cancelled, it just looks somewhat different to how we imagined – but we can still get ready to brush up on our barbecuing and hosting skills.Now it’s trickier to go to the corner shop for extras, planning is of the essence. Here are our tips for hosting the perfect post-lockdown barbecue, and enjoying a safely sociable summer.Be considerateThe first rule of new-normal socialising is to be respectful of everyone’s boundaries. You might not mind sharing food with your guests, but others might be more anxious. Find out what everyone’s comfortable with before you plan your party – and if one of your friends would prefer to bring their own food, be prepared to be OK with that.Shop smartThanks to socially distanced shopping, the etiquette of putting on a barbecue has changed, too – it’s now perfectly reasonable to ask people to bring their own food or drink if they want something specific. Meanwhile, make sure you provide enough basics, to avoid a dash to the shops, mask in hand. You can find barbecue calculators online that will tell you how much meat, veg, side dishes and drink to buy depending on the number of people attending.Buy localWhile your online shop is ideal for stocking up on basics, a barbecue is the perfect excuse to explore your local area and uncover some hidden foodie gems. From artisan ciabatta rolls and locally produced meats, to small-batch chutneys, cheeses and ale, it’s a great time to support the independent stores reopening after lockdown. As well as boosting the economy, buying locally sourced produce keeps your carbon footprint clean, too.Stock up on masksJust as you’d make sure a guest didn’t drive home after a few drinks, protecting them if they have to get a cab or public transport home is equally thoughtful. Buy some masks to hand out to anyone who might suddenly need one at the end of the evening.Play it safeYou can’t control the weather – but you can make sure staying safe feels like a natural part of the party, rather than a chore. Put out plenty of hand sanitisers and wipes for guests, hand out glasses marked with their names, and hang 2-metre-long strips of bunting as a visual reminder not to mingle too closely. Spacing out your garden furniture around a central hub, such as a fire pit, will also help remind people to keep a distance without dampening the atmosphere.Create a signature dishWith more of us cooking at home than ever, it’s worth taking the time to develop a dish that will really wow your guests. Whether it’s making a lip-smacking vegan pulled “pork” (try BOSH’s for inspiration) or perfecting an all-American regional burger (make George Motz your go-to for recipes), head to your local butcher or farmers’ market, and start planning a grill everyone will remember for the right reasons.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Its main plant, at Gaydon, Warwickshire, is only due to resume manufacturing at the end of August, later than originally planned.In January the billionaire fashion mogul Lawrence Stroll led a consortium that in effect took control of Aston Martin in a bailout shortly before the pandemic forced a deep drop in sales. Stroll has focused on restoring profitability at the carmaker, as well as firing Andy Palmer as chief executive and in his place installing Tobias Moers, the former boss of Mercedes-Benz’s performance ision, AMG.Aston Martin was also forced to restate its income statements for 2018 and 2019 after overstating profits by £15.3m in 2019.The new management found an error in the way the US region was recognising revenues that meant it counted payments to dealers and discounts for retail customers later than it should have done.Stroll, who took the role of executive chairman, said it had been “a very intense and challenging six months” and the company pointed to more difficulties ahead. Reducing the number of cars at dealerships, a key aim of Stroll as he tries to restore Aston Martin’s air of exclusivity, will continue until 2021.In its statement to the stock market, Aston Martin said: “Trading remains challenging in many markets and the pace of emergence from lockdown and consumer recovery varies significantly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14e379fa2a2de66021f716442905dbcd8ad023d8/225_244_3241_1945/master/3241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d408b3a464e6205832963f647c8fe2ee","title":"barclays profits plunge covid 19 defaults","story":"Bank’s second-quarter loan loss provision takes total credit impairment charges to £3.7bn The second-quarter loan loss provision was more than the £1.4bn analysts had expected and brings total credit impairment charges to £3.7bn for the six months to June. It is also three times the £408m charge it logged last year.Barclays said it reflected a forecasted “deterioration” in some parts of the economy, including a prolonged period of higher unemployment in the US and UK. However, this has been partially offset by the impact of government and central bank stimulus measures.The bank’s group financial director, Tushar Morzaria, said economic models were pointing to a relatively shallow recovery. “We’re not assuming a sort of very sharp snap back.”He said the bank had “quite significantly” increased provisions for potential defaults in high-risk sectors such as airlines, retail, hospitality and transport, which have been hard-hit by the pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions. Barclays said its total exposure to those sectors was £20.7bn.While Barclays said it expected lower loan loss provisions in the second half of the year, it warned that the next six months would be difficult.“Given the uncertain economic outlook and low interest rate environment, the second half of the year is expected to continue to be challenging,” the bank said.Barclays said its capital buffers – which ensure the bank can absorb major losses – were strong, but its chief executive, Jes Staley, struck a cautious tone. “Though we will remain well capitalised and ahead of our minimum requirements, we may experience stronger capital headwinds in the second half of the year,” he said. However, Staley said the bank’s risk and exposure levels were very different than they were during the 2008 financial crisis, and meant it could play a very different role in the recovery.“Our hope is to be a firewall in the economy recovery and in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic it’s much different than what happened with the banks some 10 years ago,” Staley said.Barclays has so far extended 600,000 payment holidays to customers affected by the pandemic and provided £7.7bn worth of government-backed bounce back loans and a further £2.5bn in coronavirus business interruption loans.However, Staley said demand for emergency funding and payment breaks had “slowed markedly” in recent weeks. The bank is gearing up to help businesses raise funds on financial markets, a trend that could further benefit its investment bank.“The financial markets are increasingly open,” he said. “So if you’re a company and you’ve got some financial challenges and you’re in the leisure sector or the travel sector, you can go out and raise new capital in the public markets. That’s probably one of the greatest things that we can do financially to provide financial security for these corporates.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19387fc35192251a3a05f97a68c5750897ad58f6/0_144_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f707ebdb19761689840e0a5f8b6c74c0","title":"next expects remain profit sales partially recover","story":"The business has upgraded its annual profit guidance to an expected £195m this year and said that even in a worst-case scenario, where the high street is hit by a second lockdown, it will still manage a £15m profit. The retailer, which made almost £600m in profits last year, said in April it could post losses of up to £150m this year.“Our experience over the last 13 weeks has given us much greater clarity on our online capabilities during lockdown and the state of consumer demand, and we are now more optimistic about the outlook for the full year than we were at the height of the pandemic,” Next said.Next said sales of childrenswear, home, nightwear and sportswear, and some adult casual clothing, had sold much better than formal clothing related to work, going out, overseas holidays and large social events.“Sales were dealt a devastating blow during the lockdown but have bounced back at an astonishing rate,” said Richard Lim, the chief executive of research consultancy Retail Economics.“Next’s nimble response to the pandemic highlights the inherent flexibility of their operating model and strength of the business. After years of investment in their digital operation, they are well-positioned to capitalise on the seismic shift we’re witnessing towards online.”“As a general rule, our out-of-town retail parks have significantly outperformed shopping centres and high street locations,” the company said.It said store revenues were partly impacted by the decision not to heavily promote its end-of-season sale to avoid the large queues of bargain hunters the chain normally attracts. Next also started the event on a Thursday, instead of the usual Saturday, to “reduce the risk of overcrowding”.The company also had to limit the stock available in its online sale because of the reduced capacity of its picking staff in warehouses owing to social distancing measures.The company said it was developing plans to further improve the capacity and efficiency of its warehouse operation to boost its online operation in the second half of the year. It intends to introduce new 24-hour working shift patterns, and better support the online warehouse operation during sales periods.“Our online warehouses have achieved much higher capacities than we thought possible,” the company said. “While much of our time has been focused on managing the business through the pandemic, we have not lost sight of the fact our sector was already experiencing far-reaching structural changes as consumers increase their expenditure online. If anything, these changes are likely to accelerate as a result of the crisis.”Next warned that its guidance of a “central” scenario of £195m profits could not be guaranteed, given the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus.

But as the road to normal will be long, we doubt that the leap in money growth will lead to a surge in inflation.As the £0.1bn fall in consumer credit was small relative to the average drop of £5.2bn in the previous three months, it supports other evidence that households have started to spend again. That said, in the year before the crisis consumer credit rose by £1.1bn a month, so spending remains well below normal.Turning to lending to businesses, he notes:As the extra £400m that firms borrowed from banks in June was much smaller than the huge £33.8bn they added to their debt pile in March, the corporate sector as a whole is no longer leaning on banks as heavily. That said, small businesses were still scrambling for cash. They borrowed an additional £10.7bn from banks in June, the bulk of which came through the government’s loan schemes. And while large businesses reduced their bank loans by £18.2bn, they sourced an extra £10.6bn of finance from the financial markets. But even the latter was smaller than the £18.1bn they acquired in April. So while businesses are still taking on more debt, they are doing it at a slower pace than in March or April.Analysts at Barclays have released a note on potential Covid-19 vaccines, saying that they are showing promise, but they cautioned:A working vaccine may still be 6-12 months away and getting it to enough people to make a difference may taken even longer.Here is our latest story on efforts to develop vaccines for the deadly virus:On the Covid-19 front, an attempt by Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche to repurpose its rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra to treat patients hospitalised with severe Covid-19-related pneumonia has failed in a late-stage trial. Roche launched the trial involving 330 patients in March as it joined other pharmaceutical companies seeking to repurpose existing medicines to fight the pandemic.The COVACTA trial did not meet its primary end-point of improved clinical status in patients with Covid-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary end-point of reduced patient mortality.Time for a look at the markets.In Covid-19 news, the UK has secured a deal for 60m doses of a fifth potential Covid-19 vaccine being developed by UK drugmaker GSK and France’s Sanofi Pasteur – positioning itself as one of the leaders in the global race to secure vaccine supplies with a total so far of 250m doses.Bank of England data showed mortgage approvals rose more than four-fold to 40,000 in June, but remained well below pre-crisis levels, while people repaid £86m in consumer credit, less than the average £5bn monthly repayments since March when the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed.The chief executive of Heathrow airport said the UK government must urgently introduce a passenger testing regime or face playing a game of “quarantine roulette,” as Heathrow reported a £1bn pre-tax loss for the first half of 2020. But testing passengers for Covid-19 on arrival in the UK is “not a silver bullet”, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, insisted.Aston Martin Lagonda’s losses surged to £227m in the first half as the coronavirus pandemic closed the embattled UK luxury carmaker’s dealerships and prompted an executive clear-out. The firm was also forced to restate its income statements over two years after detecting an accounting error that led it to overstate profitability in 2018 and 2019.The bosses of four US tech companies will be grilled by a congressional anti-trust committee from 5pm BST. “Companies aren’t bad just because they are big,” Facebook executive Mark Zuckerberg is set to tell US Congress, as the world’s most powerful technology companies face a historic investigation into their size and power.Meanwhile, the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane has conducted a regional visit via online meetings with businesses and community groups in northeast England. He said he saw mixed signals about the economy, and that estate agents had seen a rapid rise in activity since reopening in mid-May. Haldane voted against expanding the Bank’s stimulus programme last month.He wrote in an article for North East Times Magazine, a regional business publication:While the outlook is inevitably uncertain, given the possibility of further job losses, most felt relatively upbeat about the outlook. So far, then, so good. He picked up gloomier signals from community groups, however.People previously ‘just about managing’ have suddenly found themselves struggling, increasingly reliant on food banks.Jane Goodland, corporate affairs director at advisory and wealth management firm Quilter, says “financial education and wellbeing are vital to the success of our nation”:The pressure is on for companies, government and charities to tackle this financial vulnerability. A huge challenge when it comes to customer vulnerability is recognition. It may be that the client or customer doesn’t recognise themselves as vulnerable or even omits facts that might help them be identified as such. It becomes even harder in a digitised age when people may set up a bank account, pension, ISA etc and go years without speaking to anyone from their financial institution. There needs to be a focus on how we evolve our systems and employee training so they are attuned to even the slightest hint at vulnerability.And we also need to think about some of this vulnerability that is preventable. While life events and, to some extent, health challenges, are not within our control, we can do more to improve our financial resilience and capability, which the FCA identify as being key to financial stability.More than 24 million people in the UK show signs of being vulnerable – such as physical and mental health issues, bereavement or financial worries – according to the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. That’s out of a population of about 67 million. Over a million people received debt advice last year. The FCA says firms should do more to ensure that vulnerable consumers are receiving positive outcomes. The findings come in new guidance issued by the regulator to help firms do more for vulnerable customers.Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA, said:Today’s guidance sets out what firms should do to ensure vulnerable consumers are being treated fairly. We know many more customers will be struggling with their finances as a result of the impact of coronavirus. Supporting vulnerable consumers is a key focus for the FCA, and the coronavirus crisis has only highlighted its importance. While many firms do excellent work to support their vulnerable customers, we will not hesitate to step in where others do not.The research, which includes 21 in-depth case studies of vulnerable consumers, highlights four key themes for firms:Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, says: As always, these numbers are a useful pointer for direction of travel of the housing market in the coming months and reflect what we have been seeing. However, approvals tend to be a little bit in the past so they are not yet recording the increase in demand we have seen since lockdown eased. House purchase mortgage approvals are up significantly from their record low of last month, supported by the stamp duty holiday and continued low interest rates, but are still significantly below pre-Covid levels. Looking forward, we are a little nervous about prospects for the market once government support eases as many businesses will then have to make big decisions about whether to keep staff on, which will of course have a knock-on effect on buyer confidence.The Bank of England data also show how consumers started to repay credit card debt and loans after the Covid-19 lockdown kicked in, about £5bn a month, but the repayments have tailed off, to £86m in June.Simon Gammon, managing partner at the property firm Knight Frank’s finance ision, says the housing market clearly has been gathering pace, since the government allowed house moves and physical viewings in mid-May, after seven weeks of lockdown.The Bank of England data shows the beginning of a rebound that all of our indicators suggest is gathering pace. In fact July is on course to be our busiest month on record.There are many factors fuelling the post-lockdown rebound ning the recent cut to stamp duty, successive cuts to interest rates, currency fluctuations and tax changes, and as a result everybody from first time buyers to billionaires are active in the property market.The banks are now beginning to creak under the weight of all these applications, and we’re seeing some of the biggest lenders on the high street temporarily increase the cost of borrowing at short notice in an attempt to control the flow of business.How long this surge lasts will depend on the development of the pandemic, and the effect on employment of the wind up of government support schemes during the autumn, but it’s clear interest rates are going to remain at or close to record lows for the foreseeable.Here are the key points from the Bank of England’s lending data.You can view the BOE’s release here.NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England consumer lending figures are out.Net mortgage lending grew by £1.9bn in June, just ahead of economists’ forecasts of a £1.8bn increase and compared with May’s £1.2bn rise. Mortgage approvals also picked up as the housing market reopened, to 40,000 from May’s 9,270.The Heathrow boss told Reuters about the likely £150 cost per passenger of the Covid-19 tests:So it’s not cheap, but equally for people who are worried about being able to go back to work or get the kids into school, there will be people who are prepared to pay that to avoid the extra period of quarantine.However, Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, insisted that Britain has no alternative to quarantines yet, speaking on BBC radio.According to Reuters snaps, Holland-Kaye, the boss of Heathrow airport, said a Covid-19 test at the airport would cost about £150 per passenger – and passengers would be expected to pay. The cost of tests would come down over time, he added.The UK’s culture secretary Oliver Dowden said people can travel abroad for holidays but should appreciate that we are at a risky moment and that more quarantine measures could be imposed to stop the viurs spreading.Germany has started offering voluntary Covid-19 tests to travellers at airports, free of charge, and plans to make them compulsory for those returning from Covid-19 hotspots. People will be tested twice, upon arrival and 48 hours later. You can read more about Germany here.“Today’s results should serve as a clarion call for the government,” John Holland-Kaye said. “The UK needs a passenger testing regime and fast. Without it, Britain is just playing a game of quarantine roulette.”As many of our customers have experienced, it’s difficult to plan a holiday that way, let alone run a business.Testing offers a way to safely open up travel and trade to some of the UK’s biggest markets which currently remain closed. Our European competitors are racing ahead with passenger testing if the UK doesn’t act soon global Britain will be nothing more than a campaign slogan.The luxury carmaker Aston Martin has reported bigger losses: its first-half pre-tax loss jumped to £227m from £80m a year ago.

US policymakers will likely emphasise the lingering risks on the US economy and maintain an ultra-supportive monetary policy to provide support to its economy ravaged by the pandemic. While investors will continue looking for clues regarding alternative policy tools, including the yield curve control, we do not expect to hear any material progress before September. While there is little room left for enhanced forward guidance, the Fed will follow a clear strategy to support lending and liquidity. The market already digested the Fed’s endeavour to keep the short-term rates low for long. Combined with a solid fiscal support, the Fed won’t move more dovish on its policy for now.

The benefits would be hugeLast weekend’s rapid government U-turn over travel to Spain has left both tourists and holiday companies reeling. Who can be sure of flying to any country if a quarantine can be imposed at such short notice? Arguments are now raging over whether the government acted too impulsively and failed to consider the consequences. Yet, for the most part, these all miss an essential point: that encouraging travel abroad in the middle of a pandemic makes no epidemiological sense.With every arriving overseas visitor or returning holidaymaker, the risk of bringing Covid-19 into the country increases. The government has so far justified allowing this travel because it believes community transmission of the virus in the UK is inevitable until a vaccine arrives. It is not.Great Britain and the island of Ireland are just that – islands. Other islands, such as New Zealand and Taiwan, have shown that the Covid-19 virus can be eliminated like the first Sars virus. In these countries, life is going on largely as usual with families gathering, full stands at sporting events, and internal economies almost back to normal. Shakespeare called England: “This fortress built by nature for herself against infection.” And now the Independent Sage committee (which shadows Britain’s official science advisory group) and other experts have called for a goal of zero coronavirus – elimination of the virus – rather than settling for suppression. Of course, both New Zealand and Taiwan avoided substantial “first waves” – making their tasks much easier. Both also scaled up their public health workforces to aggressively test, trace and isolate cases and their contacts. But both, even now, have mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine for incoming travellers.Yes, international tourism has dried up, but it has been replaced by domestic tourism. And despite this, these countries are hardly isolated – the proportion of Taiwan’s GDP accounted for by external trade is double that of the UK and continues largely uninterrupted. Can we replicate these successes in the UK and Ireland?Ireland and Scotland had large epidemics, with the death rate per million in Ireland being fractionally higher at its peak in late April than that of the UK. But both Ireland and Scotland have brought their infection and death rates down dramatically. Last week the Republic of Ireland reported 11 Covid-19 deaths, and Northern Ireland and Scotland reported none. England and Wales’ combined populations are five times higher than the other three countries’ total, yet the number of deaths in that week was many times greater. Ireland and Scotland demonstrate that the virus can be almost fully suppressed even after a strong first wave. Can we reach beyond that to elimination?There is a technocratic objection to the word “elimination”. In infectious disease circles it usually refers to absence of community transmission in a country or region, for some substantial period (for measles, it is 12 months). Because outbreaks may still occur, many specialists prefer the concepts of infection “control” or “suppression”.In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, it seems reasonable to define elimination as a preliminary, though not necessarily durable, absence of community transmission. New Zealand has had no community-transmitted cases for nearly three months (all new cases have been in quarantined arrivals from overseas). In the context of a worldwide pandemic, as Australia has found, reintroduction of the virus from abroad is an ever-present threat.First minister Nicola Sturgeon has claimed that Scotland is “not far away” from eliminating coronavirus, and a committee of Irish scientists has called on their government to adopt a policy of virus elimination. Such a goal has three major advantages over suppression: absence of transmission means no Covid-19 illnesses and deaths life and the economy can go back to a (guarded) level of normality and it makes a second wave in the winter much less likely.So if we want to avoid a “November nightmare” and have a relatively “normal” Christmas, a push for elimination gives us the best chance.But is elimination achievable? We think it is – though it would require major changes to the British government’s current thinking. A bold elimination goal would require further strengthening of the test, track and isolate system with clear, transparent and spin-free reporting of its successes and failures. The release of data to local public health authorities is a welcome first step. It would entail income support for people who are asked to self-isolate, and consideration of supervised hotel accommodation for those who represent a risk to their families.It would also require abandoning the troubled air-bridge system – the deficiencies of which are becoming increasingly clear. So, for British people planning their summer holidays, it would mean replacing trips abroad with UK travel. Of course, international airlines will need subsidies to avoid bankruptcy it would also mean that lorries arriving in the UK would be driven to their destinations by British drivers.All this is a big ask. But the prize is huge. It would mean a relatively normal internal economy, with domestic tourists replacing international ones. The prize is getting children back to school releasing our aged population from home isolation or confinement in care homes protecting our black and minority-ethnic communities revitalising the arts and sport. And a reduction in the probability of a second wave in the winter, crippling the NHS and requiring a second national lockdown.We all hope one or more vaccines will work and be relatively free of side-effects, but experience shows we cannot assume such a vaccine will be widely available any time soon.Compared to the costs, the benefits are huge. This prize is within our grasp.

After years of alternating between calling Ireland’s Brexit tactics cynical and naive, even the  this month praised Ireland for “taking over the Eurozone” and “extending their grip” on the continent’s institutions. Having negotiated its way through the Brexit morass, swerved the worst of Covid-19, secured a seat on the UN security council, and won a historic EU judgment that means they have the right to insist the world’s richest country does not pay us any tax – hurrah! – Ireland’s place in the global hierarchy appears on the rise, and the UK has continued marvelling at the shrewd cunning of their plucky little neighbour.Why, then, does this praise seem faint, or unearned? It’s not that we hate adulation. Seeking flattery from abroad is one of Ireland’s most crippling and shameful addictions, right up there with Garth Brooks or pairing coleslaw with lasagne. This is a fact confirmed any time a foreign celebrity appears on Irish telly. “So tell me,” RTE talk show host Ryan Tubridy will dutifully ask Greta Thunberg or Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, right after they’ve finished talking about their work clearing minefields for Unicef: “What is your favourite thing about Athlone?”It’s just that Ireland hasn’t turned into some 24th-century futurist utopia so much as installed sensible public policy that should seem unremarkable in a modern democracy – and in fact, given most western responses to the coronavirus, actually is unremarkable. This government has received praise at home for its response to the crisis, but we should remember that its unheralded Fianna FáilFine Gael coalition-of-the-boring was instituted to obstruct Sinn Féin, who just this year saw an unprecedented leftward surge in support from people tired of both main parties.While Ireland has received plaudits from the World Health Organization for its dealing with the current crisis, the same mistakes with care homes were made in Ireland as elsewhere, and small clusters of infection have re-emerged in recent days. The idea of Ireland as a model of competence in the field of social and public health is also one most Irish people might find surprising, since it has its own issues that rarely attract attention from afar: a mounting housing crisis that currently means 10,000 people are homeless in one of the hemisphere’s richest states a rolling series of healthcare scandals surrounding everything from poor bed provision to faulty cervical cancer tests and the remarkable saga of the new National Children’s hospital in Dublin, originally budgeted at €400m but is now forecast to be costing around €2.4bn, making it one of the planet’s most expensive buildings. Ireland’s decision to enter lockdown earlier than Britain was a good one, but only in comparison with the grievous laxity of our easterly neighbour. The early days of Ireland’s track and trace app are showing positive results, but this is a success unduly magnified by the British government’s initial resistance to such technologies, and subsequent failure to launch one that doesn’t break its own data protection laws. Irish people have largely followed the protocols as advised, but they’ve also enjoyed relatively consistent, sober messaging from government, media and health experts. This is in contrast to than Britain’s bewildering stew of denials, contradictions and outright political chicanery around adherence to their own guidelines – none of which have faced any serious consequences from the UK’s parliament or largely right-leaning press.It’s on this last point that one might find a meaningful distinction between the two countries. While England’s political culture is notoriously barbed and acerbic, Ireland’s is rather strait-laced and sedate. Irish newspapers may be dismissive and hectoring when it comes to Sinn Féin’s surge in support, but they rarely depict them as communists who live in bins. They afford a soft touch to government ministers who have to be woken from a nap in the Dáil to vote against workers’ rights, but stop short of exalting them as celestial objects bestowing sunshine on their grateful subjects. Despite this, the Irish press has landed more recent hits on their government than their English counterparts. Earlier in July, Barry Cowan’s 17-day tenure as a minister for agriculture was ended after a slew of coverage of a years-old, and spent, conviction for drink driving. Compare this with the lack of any consequences for Dominic Cummings, or the fact that both Priti Patel and Gavin Williamson regained senior ministerial posts shortly after being sacked for actions that almost reach the definition of espionage.It’s this sense of political unseriousness that seems the most marked difference between the two places, and it says less about the “enviable beauty” of Ireland’s system than about Britain’s further slide into a fact-averse, consequence-free banana republic of malevolent toffs. This style of politics had ruinous effects on the Brexit referendum and the subsequent EU negotiations, and has now become criminally disastrous in a pandemic that’s costing many more lives in Britain than their nearest neighbour.For all its other ills, Ireland has not yet disposed of experts, accountability or political memory. These things are taken seriously, and a combination of steady, boring diplomacy and common-sense public health measures are granting Ireland greater praise than they should, now that those approaches can be so readily contrasted to our American and British counterparts. It’s a sort of “clowns to the left of us, jokers to the right” arrangement, which continues to herald great acclaim for an Irish government so dysfunctional that Leo Varadkar spent a day last week briefing against his coalition partner, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, on whether their green list of accepted travel destinations should even be released.Praise for Ireland as shrewd and canny operators gets the diplomatic calculus back to front. Ireland is not outflanking a competent, longstanding neighbour. She just has the pleasure of being compared with the gurning claptrapocracy next door. So long as Boris Johnson waffles, prevaricates and sees fit to place the NHS on the table for sale, amid the strongest surge in its appreciation since its founding, Ireland’s mundane governing coalitions will continue looking important and nice by comparison."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc7926b8c3e1e0643a34c37ddfa1308d10194cb5/0_350_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd8bf578faae7984a97efd2c02992a8","title":"modis covid 19 policies make clear that in india some lives matter more than others","story":"Draconian government responses to the pandemic have merely served to widen India’s class, caste, gender and religious idesIn February, 12-year-old Jamlo Makdam left her home in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh to work as a farm labourer in the chilli fields of Telangana, earning 200 rupees (about £2) a day. But on the morning of 23 March, she – along with hundreds of million others across the country – suddenly discovered that they were not allowed to work. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, had announced India’s draconian lockdown the previous evening, stopping all economic activity, even all movement, with just four hours’ notice. No public transport, no people allowed on roads, no shops or workplaces open and no chance of livelihood for the 450 million or so informal workers in India who have no legal or social protections.For a while, the young girl lived off the wages she had been saving up to take home. But in a few weeks the money had run out, and without any compensation in the form of food or cash transfers, she and her friends were on the verge of starvation. Desperate, they began the long trek home, walking 150km over three days and nights through forests and fields, avoiding the highways where they could be stopped and punished by police simply for daring to be out on the road. But on 18 April, dehydrated and malnourished, Jamlo collapsed and died, just a few hours away from her home.Jamlo became another statistic in the ever-increasing number of “lockdown deaths”, now estimated to be nearly a thousand, resulting from the brutal state response to Covid-19 that has both created a humanitarian catastrophe and failed to stop the relentless surge of the disease. In India, dealing with the pandemic has never really been about lives versus livelihoods: it was, and continues to be, about lives versus lives, with some lives being much cheaper than others. India has been a world leader in economic disparities and social discrimination for a while the pandemic policy response brought this upfront while introducing newer, even more unsavoury, elements.If societal responses have been lacking, government responses have been even worse. (States like Kerala are honourable exceptions.) The central government’s approach to public health has been miserly, incompetent and insensitive. Containment policies copied from China and Europe display no recognition of the lived reality of much of India’s population. Social – more accurately physical – distancing can’t be done by people in crowded and congested homes with five or more people living in one room. Frequent hand-washing is a luxury when access to clean water is limited, and it must be collected through lengthy, arduous journeys made by women and girls. But officialdom has seen no need to adjust these guidelines or make it possible for poor people to achieve them. And treatment for the infected varies hugely according to income: public hospitals are overcrowded and overstretched private ones charge stratospheric rates.The official attitude to the estimated 100 million or more rural-urban migrants who build India’s towns and cities and provide their services was even more telling. Early into the lockdown, special repatriation flights were arranged for Indians stranded abroad. But internal migrants got no such relief for two months they were deprived of their right to livelihood but only – and rarely – received the most paltry compensation. When, in desperation, they travelled on handcarts, containers and cement mixers or simply walked hundreds of kilometres to get home, they faced beatings, detention, being sprayed with disinfectant, even being killed on rail tracks where they slept thinking that no trains were allowed. The arbitrary dusk-to-dawn nationwide curfews (with no public health rationale) forced them to walk in the blazing heat. When special train services for such migrants were finally started, nearly two months into lockdown, impoverished workers had to congregate in stations in large numbers to get tickets, expose themselves to infection and then pay full fares. Conditions on these trains were often so appalling, with delayed journeys in intense heat without food and water provision, that in just 10 days in May, 80 people died on board.There are many other ways that policy responses to Covid-19 have intensified existing inequalities of class, caste, and gender and even religion. Despite this, poll numbers do not appear to show much of a drop in support for Modi and the opposition (including political parties, trade unions and social movements) does not seem have made much headway.

An earlier version incorrectly used an image of the rapper Kano.Twitter is simultaneously many things: a means of elevating otherwise ignored voices, a platform for facilitating debate, a portal to access a bewildering array of information – and a cesspit of hatred.This weekend, the grime artist Wiley – with his half a million followers – unleashed a tirade of undiluted antisemitism on to the site over the course of two days, leading some to observe a 48-hour boycott of the social media platform to protest Twitter’s slowness to act. But it has not proved uncontroversial some users have noted that the website has long hosted unapologetic neo-Nazis such as US white supremacist Richard Spencer, so why wait for a black celebrity to make antisemitic comments to take such action? It took Twitter years to remove inflammatory far-right personalities, such as Tommy Robinson and Katie Hopkins. With a range of Jewish organisations urging a boycott and antisemitic hate crimes at a record high, I’m among those who heeded the call, while respecting the views of others who believe this is not an effective means to challenge racism.That Twitter needs to take further action is beyond doubt. On a daily basis, the site pulses with Islamophobia, anti-blackness, antisemitism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, and every other form of bigotry, often directly targeted at iniduals. As Alex Hern, the ’s technology editor notes, Twitter’s policy in this area has gradually evolved from a commitment to free speech fundamentalism, which regarded racism as a bad opinion to be challenged, to a commitment to upholding minority rights in the face of illegitimate hate speech.But it is a tech company that is “fundamentally underfunded in Silicon Valley terms”, says Hern, and is slow to develop new ideas, let alone clamp down on hate speech. This doesn’t mean Twitter should not invest in more moderators and take swifter action, particularly in a case like this one, which was so egregious because of the size of Wiley’s platform combined with the intensity and duration of his racist tirade.There is something profoundly uncomfortable about this debate, however. Twitter reflects hatred that is embedded in the nation’s social fabric as much as it incubates it. Racism and other forms of bigotry remain organising principles of British society. As the scholar Alana Lentin puts it, racism is not a moral “problem of ‘bad’ iniduals”, as the current debate on Twitter’s toxicity encourages us to believe, but a “systemic one” rooted in European colonialism, when the subjugation of African and Aboriginal peoples was justified by treating them as biologically inferior.Similarly, antisemitism consists of deadly, centuries-old conspiracy theories ingrained in European culture that present Jews as devious puppetmasters behind injustices, “which in turn drew on Christian antisemitic themes”, as Professor David Feldman notes.The systems of racism and other bigotries – rather than inidual racists and bigots – should be our starting point. Black people are discriminated against by the justice system and more likely to be condemned to lower pay and unemployment while patriarchy leaves women objectified and subjected to routine misogyny, and LGBTQ people treated as gender traitors deserving verbal or physical punishment beatings. An online platform open to all will inevitably project these wider phenomena no Twitter moderation policy, no matter how robust, can adequately counter bigotries that are systemic in our societies.Unfortunately, our public discourse prefers theatrical debates about whether a person or statement is “racist” or “not racist” to a proper reckoning with how race functions as a system of power. And power, in turn, is part of what is missing from a conversation about racism in public life that focuses on tweets rather than the powerful institutions that set the tone in any national community. Hopkins, who was banned from Twitter this year, was not a monster created by social media. She was a columnist for the Sun, where she compared migrants to cockroaches, leading to condemnation from the United Nations. She continued to fall upwards, rewarded with a column at Mail Online and a chatshow at LBC. It was the old media who built her up, generously adding to her Twitter follower count in the process: a positive feedback loop of hate.This week, a leader in the Times delivered a pious judgment on “social media and hate speech: Publish and Be Damned”. This is the newspaper that was forced to issue a correction after a series of misleading articles that began with the front page splash “Christian child forced into Muslim foster care”.Just this week, as the Twitter boycott began, one Times columnist published a piece headlined “Let’s not be afraid to challenge Traveller culture”. When this paper of record publishes articles with headlines such as “Islamophobia is a fiction to shut down debate” – written by Melanie Phillips, whose work was approvingly cited by Norwegian far-right terrorist Anders Breivik – its bigotry is considerably more dangerous than that of @barry48593 from Slough on Twitter. Its reach is far greater, and it confers respectability and permissibility on racism and bigotry.Online hatred is an urgent and growing problem, but its seriousness is not diminished by observing that powerful rightwing newspapers are this country’s most prominent platform for bigotry. Do tech firms need to do more? Yes, absolutely. But the lack of consistency in this debate risks looking like hypocrisy.When we ask who has helped to fuel the doubling of hate crimes in a five-year period, our scrutiny should not be confined to slobbering bigots hunched over computers, but should also include those with far more power and clout.

Managed honeybees, meanwhile, are tended to by beekeepers, but have still been assailed by disease, leading to concerns that the three-quarters of the world’s food crops dependent upon pollinators could falter due to a lack of bees.The new research appears to confirm some of these fears.Of seven studied crops grown in 13 states across America, five showed evidence that a lack of bees is hampering the amount of food that can be grown, including apples, blueberries and cherries. A total of 131 crop fields were surveyed for bee activity and crop abundance by a coalition of scientists from the US, Canada and Sweden.“The crops that got more bees got significantly more crop production,” said Rachael Winfree, an ecologist and pollination expert at Rutgers University who was a senior author of the paper, published by the Royal Society. “I was surprised, I didn’t expect they would be limited to this extent.”Swaths of American agriculture is propped up by honeybees, frantically replicated and shifted around the country in hives in order to meet a growing need for crop pollination.Almonds, one of the two crops not shown to be suffering from a lack of bees in the study, are mostly grown in California, where most of the beehives in the US are trucked to each year for a massive almond pollination event.The US is at the forefront of ergent trends that are being replicated elsewhere in the world – as farming becomes more intensive to churn out greater volumes to feed a growing global population, tactics such as flattening wildflower meadows, spraying large amounts of insecticide and planting monocultural fields of single crops are damaging the bee populations crucial for crop pollination.“Honeybee colonies are weaker than they used to be and wild bees are declining, probably by a lot,” said Winfree. “The agriculture is getting more intensive and there are fewer bees, so at some point the pollination will become limited. Even if honeybees were healthy, it’s risky to rely so much on a single bee species. It’s predictable that parasites will target the one species we have in these monocultural crop fields.”The paper recommends that farmers gain a better understanding of the optimal amount of pollination needed to boost crop yields, as well as review whether the level of pesticide and fertilizer put on to fields is appropriate.“The trends we are seeing now are setting us up for food security problems,” Winfree said. “We aren’t yet in a complete crisis now but the trends aren’t going in the right direction. Our study shows this isn’t a problem for 10 or 20 years from now – it’s happening right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f178ff5b7893fa7941b758b60376d89b9a650576/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92b655d43636887346036e6a29afb2e4","title":"food waste increases in uk as coronavirus restrictions ease","story":"Levels are still below those recorded before lockdown, says government advisory bodyHousehold food waste in the UK has increased by nearly a third as coronavirus lockdown restrictions have been eased and could spiral further, new research has warned.While concerns about going to the shops and running out of food motivated people to waste less in April, their resolve appears to be weakening as restrictions have lifted.The most recent official figures covering pre-lockdown, published in January, show that UK households waste 4.5m tonnes of food a year that could have been eaten, worth £14bn – or £700 a year for an average family with children.Next month, Wrap will launch a new campaign called Keep Crushing It, aimed at motivating people to keep up the positive actions they adopted during lockdown, including checking their fridge temperature, freezing more food and making shopping lists. Planning before a shop is the behaviour that most people were likely to continue after lockdown, the study found.Peter Maddox, director of Wrap UK, said: “We’ve seen clearly how effective the Love Food Hate Waste messages and tools are – we need to reach more people to widen our impact.

They may look as if they require plenty of effort but are not as hard as you might imagine, plus you’ll have a lot of fun making them. You can make this recipe with any kind of white cake although I’ve chosen this one because it’s firm and will be easier to shape. Rummage around in your kitchen cupboards to find sweets you already have that would look good as sushi fillings.For the cake185g self-raising flour160g caster sugar30g cornflour¾ tsp baking powder120g vegan butter (room temperature, cubed)80ml plant-based milk120g vegan yoghurt1tsp vanilla bean pasteFor the sugar syrup ‘soy sauce’50ml  boiling water75g dark muscovado sugarPlus1 piece of stem ginger in syrupBrown, orange, pink, and red food dyesBlack and pink fondant icing100g fine desiccated coconutVarious gummy sweets (orange, pink and purple colours work well)Marzipan1 green applePreheat the oven to 200C (180C fan)400Fgas mark 6 and grease an 18cm cake tin, then line the base with a circle of greaseproof paper.Whisk together all the dry ingredients (self-raising flour, caster sugar, cornflour and baking powder). Then add in the cubes of vegan butter, and beat together until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs.Add in the plant-based milk, vegan yoghurt and vanilla. Beat until combined. Then whisk using an electric whisk on high for another three minutes, until light in colour and fluffy. If whisking by hand, it’ll take longer.Pour into the prepared cake tin, and then bake for 30 to 40 minutes until the top springs back when pressed lightly, and an inserted skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for five minutes, then run a knife around the edges and turn out on to a wire rack. Once the cake has cooled, wrap in clingfilm and then place in the freezer for two hours (this will make the cake easier to cut).To make the buttercream, whisk together the butter and icing sugar until soft and fluffy. Remove two teaspoons of buttercream into a separate bowl and dye this green – this will be the “wasabi”. Cover both bowls and set aside for now. Slice the piece of stem ginger into thin slivers. Add a tiny amount of pink food dye and rub into the ginger to make it look like the pickled variety.Spoon some green buttercream into a small dish, and place the ginger next to it. Make the sugar syrup “soy sauce” by mixing the boiling water with the muscovado sugar until dissolved (place in the microwave in short bursts if needed). Then pour into a small serving dish.When the cake is chilled, cut off the brown crusts and then use a small round cutter to stamp out pieces of cake. Use a sharp knife to cut out rectangular shapes, and carve the top edges so that they’re slightly curved. You are aiming for the general shape of the rice in nigiri sushi. Cut or stamp out as many shapes as possible. You will have leftover cake scraps – you can eat these as they are, or turn them into cake pops.To make the maki-shaped cake sushi, use a palette knife to completely cover the mini round cakes with white buttercream. Roll out the black fondant until thin, then cut into strips. Wrap the cakes in the black fondant so the sides are covered but not the top. Sprinkle the outer edge of the cake top with desiccated coconut, and then put small chopped pieces of gummy sweets, marzipan or apple in the centre.To make the nigiri-shaped cake sushi, use a palette knife to completely cover the rectangular cakes with white buttercream, then sprinkle over the desiccated coconut. Make the fish toppings by shaping the pink fondant into fish slices. Then paint using food dye mixed with a little water. Use a knife or toothpick to create texture. Place these on top of the coconut-covered cakes. Shape the marzipan into a rectangle to resemble tamago, which you can use as a topping. Wrap with another thin piece of black fondant.

Percy Pig is a hugely successful brand of sweets, sold by Marks \u0026amp Spencer.He turned vegetarian last year and underwent a cut in sugar. But like so many other brands of sweets, say obesity campaigners, the hype hides the truth that too many Percys will make you fat (and rot your teeth).“Made with real fruit juice,” say the Percy Pig packets. “No artificial colours or flavourings.” They may look like the answer to a parent or grandparent’s prayers – sweets with little harm.But the first three and therefore largest items on the list of ingredients are glucose syrup, sugar and glucose-fructose syrup. Next comes fruit juice from concentrates, which contains sugar, however natural it may be. And to round it all off, the last item is inverse sugar syrup, which is another mixture of glucose and fructose, made by heating table sugar with water.“I just think that is not right. I think that is genuinely misleading,” said the restaurateur Henry Dimbleby at the launch of his National Food Strategy. He admits he has had “a bugbear about Percy Pigs” for a while (though the report also singles out Innocent’s lemon and lime-flavoured Juicy Water for saying “no added sugar” but omitting to mention the eight teaspoons-worth of natural sugars from grapes and pears).The strategy report says: “One of the most egregious sins of the modern food industry is its habit of clothing itself, and its products, in false virtue … ‘No artificial colours or artificial flavourings’ trills the packaging for Percy Pig, the ‘soft gums made with fruit juice’… How many parents take the time to check the ingredients list? If they did, they might (assuming they know how ingredient lists work) be agog to find that the three largest ingredients by weight are glucose syrup, sugar and glucose-fructose-syrup.“I single out Marks \u0026amp Spencer here, not because it is the biggest sinner, but because it is such a well-trusted company. A British institution, M\u0026ampS has the pledge ‘we always strive to do the right thing’ as one of its guiding principles. If M\u0026ampS – which is a great deal more scrupulous than many food companies – is guilty of such trickery, you can be sure the practice is ubiquitous.“Food packaging is increasingly littered with boasts that, if not quite lies, are at least wilfully misleading. ‘Low fat’ often means high starch, but it never says so. The words ‘free from’ and ‘less’ are sprinkled around without context. ‘Free from’ refined sugar, but rigid with fruit sugars? Nutritional values – calories, salt, sugar etc – are given ‘per portion’, even when a portion bears no resemblance to the quantity on offer.”An M\u0026ampS spokesperson said: “All our products have clear labelling so that customers can make informed choices about what they buy. All our Percy Pigs are made with natural fruit juices and no artificial colours or flavourings and last year we also introduced a range of Percy Pigs with one third less sugar.”No sweets can ever be healthy. The clue is in the name – they are sweet because of sugar. Fruit is very healthy, but only if you eat the whole orange and don’t squeeze six of them for the juice and throw away the fibre. Natural sugars are not magically good for you because they come from nature. So does sugar cane. Sugars make a lot of our food taste better, but the key is to have a little as an occasional, not habitual, treat – not to consume a bag of Percy Pigs because they sound healthy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3076c2f13dfda3eb5bc30f3df7c33546f2d34604/0_90_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb114c4d230d3b9e010db83935bdee79","title":"verdict that kept manchester city in europe delivers some glancing blows cas judgment","story":"Cas judgment outlines reasons for finding in favour of City, but shows the club’s case wasn’t as ‘irrefutable’ as it made outSo Manchester City’s hierarchy won the war they waged furiously against European football’s governing body Uefa, but the reality of the victory does not quite match the claims they made during their long campaign.The panel at the court of arbitration for sport decided 2-1 in City’s favour to overturn the comprehensive guilty finding and two-year Champions League ban imposed by Uefa’s Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) in February, but the published judgment nevertheless exposes a core of contradictions in the club’s case. In May 2019, after the CFCB’s “investigatory chamber” (IC) referred charges to the “adjudicatory chamber” (AC) that City – owned by Sheikh Mansour of the Abu Dhabi ruling family – overstated sponsorships by the state airline Etihad and telecoms giant Etisalat, the club publicly accused the IC’s chairman, Yves Leterme, of bad faith and “a basic lack of due process”.City have never explained what evidence supported this serious public criticism, or the allegations of bias made against Leterme and all members of the IC, AC and Uefa itself after the AC’s guilty decision in February. But the club’s statement said: “The accusation of financial irregularities remains entirely false and the CFCB IC referral ignores a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence provided by Manchester City.”The Cas panel’s full 93-page judgment does not quite support that: City’s hierarchy did not provide “a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence” they refused requests for evidence and witnesses and obstructed the investigation. Criticising City for that, the judgment even states that the club itself accepted there were legitimate grounds for the charges: “The panel is of the view that Uefa by no means filed frivolous charges against MCFC. As also acknowledged by MCFC, there was a legitimate basis to prosecute MCFC.”While they did overturn the AC’s decision by a majority, the panel did not actually find that City’s alleged financial irregularities were “entirely false”. They found one of the AC’s key findings “time-barred”: that in 2012 and 2013 Etisalat had not paid £15m in sponsorships, which in 2014 City declared to the CFCB when making a settlement under the financial fair play rules. The judgment recites the finding that Mansour’s company vehicle for owning City, the Abu Dhabi United Group, had made or “caused to be made” those payments instead. It also notes that the CFCB did not have a fully “complete and accurate picture of two payments to MCFC in 2012 and 2013” when the settlement was agreed.The panel overturned the guilty finding relating to Etisalat because two of their members decided that any breach of rules had not happened in 2014 when, the AC and IC found, City’s financial information provided for the settlement was false. Instead, presumably to the bemusement of the IC, AC and Uefa’s lawyers, the Cas majority decided any breach happened in 2012 and 2013, when the payments were made. CFCB rules require breaches to be prosecuted within five years – even if the evidence only emerged in November 2018 when the German magazine Der Spiegel published “leaks” of City’s emails. So, the Cas panel decided the Etisalat charges were “time-barred” when the IC prosecuted them in May 2019.City’s complaint that they presented the IC with “a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence” stood for longer than a year before the details now revealed that they obstructed the investigation. The Cas panel found that City’s hierarchy declined to provide emails and other documents when asked by the IC and AC, and refused requests for executives to appear as witnesses.They did provide more testimony to Cas, with City director Simon Pearce, and former Etihad chief executive James Hogan, among others, giving evidence, and with the Etisalat charges timed out, the panel decided that the AC’s finding that Mansour had also substantially subsidised the Etihad sponsorship was “not established”.Ultimately, based on the information City provided – apparently including the stated £15m sponsorships from Etisalat – Uefa and City then agreed a settlement.Cliff also sent a tasteless email reacting to the death of Jean-Luc Dehaene, the then IC chair, and like Leterme a former prime minister of Belgium, writing with reference to the seven-person IC: “1 down, 6 to go.” Mortifying as it must have been for him to see that private bad joke held up to the light of day, and insistent as City were not to dignify an alleged hack with any response, they might just have dealt with that by apologising.The hierarchy’s scornful statement after the AC’s guilty decision was in effect contradicted within days in an in-house video interview with their own chief executive, Ferran Soriano. City had again claimed the process was biased, naming and blaming Leterme, and refusing to recognise any CFCB independence from Uefa. “Simply put, this is a case initiated by Uefa, prosecuted by Uefa and judged by Uefa,” the club said.Loyalists to Uefa’s FFP system, which has deterred European clubs from spending beyond their means on wages and hugely improved the game’s overall financial stability, reject that anyway. The CFCB process is integral to Uefa, and is set up to be as independent as possible so that the FFP compliance processes are credible. Whatever, Soriano’s acknowledgment of Uefa as a decent governing body never punched through the months of denunciation. Some fans arrived at City’s next Champions League match – privileged heights to which the Abu Dhabi mega-money has taken the club – with banners including “Uefa Scum” and “Uefa Mafia”.Since Mansour took over City in 2008, Mubarak’s regime has been exceptionally skilled at balancing their unchallengeable spending – £1.3bn from the ownership – with good public relations: celebrating the club’s heritage and supporter loyalty, embracing good causes, investing in the community. In their war with Uefa, that slipped. City’s ownership was revealed as a group prepared to wave millions at lawyers to hammer European football’s governing body for trying to uphold its rules. City’s hierarchy have won that war, but apart from their own supporters, whom they encouraged to join in, their approach has not done much to win friends or influence people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73a47d02d0b0d19e11789c5d01be438e8da90346/0_37_1193_716/master/1193.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d86294c298fca6587ce11db7e516b778","title":"which siblings have been signed from different clubs at the same time","story":"Plus: more floods of first-half goals, vertical kit sponsors and who is England’s worst goalkeeper?• Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“Stockport County have just signed Connor and James Jennings, from different clubs. They are brothers. Have there been many other clubs who have done the same?” asks Dan Levy.It depends what is being asked, Dan. If it is brothers coming from different clubs and signing for the same team and crossing paths there are quite a few examples, but if you are asking if other brothers have signed from different clubs at exactly the same time, as the Jennings did at Stockport, we’re struggling.Mark McGowan, though, has found an example of siblings signing in the same month from different clubs: “The Paixão twins (Flávio and Marco) signed for Hamilton Accies in August 2009 from different teams (Flávio from Benidorm and Marco from Cultural Leonesa). They were more noted for coordinated goal celebrations than any particular football ability and left in 2011, for separate Iranian clubs. Interestingly their footballing partnership was reunited in 2016 at Lechia Gdansk having, again, signed from different clubs.”Another set of twins to join forces were the Oriols, Edu and Joan. Both joined Blackpool in the summer of 2014, with Edu moving to Lancashire just 10 days after his brother. It was not the first time they had played together, having both enjoyed loan spells at Reus in their native Catalonia during the 200607 season. Incidentally, as they both left Bloomfield Road in January 2015 to sign for Rapid Bucharest. Jonathan Benteke arrived at Crystal Palace from Zulte Waregem 11 days after his elder brother, Christian, arrived from Liverpool. He only played once, against Middlesbrough, when he came on as a replacement for … Christian.If we broaden it out to brothers arriving at the same destination from different clubs within a season or two of each other then Matt Kitson has this example: “Huddersfield Town signed Efe Sodje from Crewe at the start of the 2003-04 season and then his brother Akpo at the start of the next season from Erith and Belvedere. They did sell both at the end of the same season and Akpo didn’t really feature as memory serves, so the opportunity for them to play in the same team was limited. Disappointingly they didn’t sign the other brother, Sam, at the same time. A missed opportunity.”“I have an example of brothers signed from two different football clubs,” adds Alex Boritchev. “The Kovac brothers, Niko and Robert, were signed by Bayern Munich from Bayer Leverkusen and Hamburg respectively, in 2001.” Good knowledge, Alex. There were of course the Compton brothers at Arsenal, too, if we go back further in time, to before the second world war: Denis was better at cricket while Leslie’s forte was football, and both represented the Gunners and Middlesex, signing for Arsenal at around the same time.Michael Butler, meanwhile, highlights Julio Santa Cruz, who joined Blackburn Rovers in 2008, a year after his brother, Roque, had taken the Premier League by storm. Julio left in 2011 without making a first-team appearance.Take out the requirement of brothers signing for the same club simultaneously, and you open up a whole new world of possibilities. Eden and Thorgan Hazard at Chelsea, Phil and Gary Neville at Manchester United, Fábio and Rafael da Silva also at Manchester United, André and Jordan Ayew at Swansea City, Kolo and Yaya Touré at Manchester City, and Sean and Matthew Longstaff at Newcastle, to name only a few.We’ve had a few more contenders for most goals scored in the first half of a professional match …“Derby were 9-0 up at the break in their Uefa Cup tie with Finn Harps in September 1976 at the Baseball Ground,” cheers Steven McGhee. “We went on to win 12-0 and, yes, it is our record victory. Derby won the second leg 4-1.”Oh, and Bill McGinley gets in touch with this little note: “In reply to George Jones’s query regarding highest first-half scores, Norman Shuttleworth mentions the 7-0 scoreline after 45 minutes of the Bury v Tranmere game in January 1970,” he writes. “What he doesn’t mention is that four of those goals were scored by George Jones. Coincidence?”“Hi, just read the bit about Ajax’s vertical sponsor in this week’s Knowledge,” writes Mike Pollitt. “In the 93-94 season Huddersfield Town were sponsored by Vileda and had an incredible third shirt (surely a contender for most 90s shirt ever) which had the mop manufacturers’ name vertically down the side of the shirt.”Huddersfield also got a slap on the wrist – a £50,000 fine, in fact – after unveiling a home sash-style kit with that massive Paddy Power logo emblazoned across it.OK, it’s not a sponsor, but David Seaman’s garish red, yellow and green second strip at Euro ’96 had ENGLAND written on it in vertical letters. As students of the game, you’ll have worked out that the below photo is Seaman comforting Gareth Southgate after missing that fateful shoot-out penalty against Germany in the semi-final.“I don’t know what inspired me to ask this question but can you tell me who, statistically speaking, is the worst England goalkeeper in history?” asked Charlie Geller in September 2005.The worst – in sheer statistical terms – is Upton Park’s Conrad Warner, who conceded seven on his debut against Scotland in 1878, and unsurprisingly didn’t play again. For goalkeepers who played more than once, the worst is Pilgrims’ Harry Swepstone, who let in 18 goals in six games during the 1880s, but for those with 10 or more caps, Gil Merrick of Birmingham City stands out. Not aided by the 13 he conceded in the two Hungarian hammerings of the 1950s, Merrick let in a total of 45 in 23 internationals (1.96 goals per game).“Birmingham took the unusual step of retiring Jude Bellingham’s No 22 shirt after the teenage prodigy secured a move to Borussia Dortmund.

Now that Watford have gone down too, is this be the first time two teams wearing predominantly yellow shirts have been relegated from the top league in the same season?” muses Jonathan Tasker.“Has there been in a club in any league that were as high as Blackpool (2010-11) were in the goalscoring rankings (8th), who scored as many goals (55) and still got relegated?” asks Tommy Lam.• Send your questions and answers to knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51bb856db6ff19a110dbf751d94f4f62e9445adb/8_85_2084_1251/master/2084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4095337a78e9b89d74e6dbcdec953068","title":"football five substitutes rule does not benefit the big clubs and here is why","story":"The academic and former Athletic Bilbao head of talent ID explains why the issue is not as simple as it appearsLast month I was chatting to my friend Ernesto Valverde, the former Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona coach who I got to know well when I was Athletic’s head of talent ID. For once we were disagreeing. He, like many in football, thought that the temporary rule change to allow five substitutions from an extended bench of nine players favoured the big clubs. I insisted it wouldn’t.At the time it felt like the debate didn’t matter much either way, given the rule was only expected to last until the end of the season. Now, however, Ifab has agreed to extend it, to the dismay of many. Burnley’s manager, Sean Dyche, and Aston Villa’s Dean Smith are prominent critics – and one well-regarded journalist recently claimed it “really does not take the brains of Lloyd George to work out that it is a rule which will favour richer clubs who have squads packed with larger numbers of higher-quality players”. However, this issue really is not as simple as it appears on the surface. Let me explain why.My starting point is this: if being able to use five substitutes favoured the big clubs, you would expect them to make more changes compared with smaller teams. However, since the season resumed that hasn’t been the case. After lockdown was relaxed in the Bundesliga, for instance, the top four teams used 4.03 substitutes per game, while the bottom four teams used 4.59 substitutes per game. In the Premier League, Manchester City and Chelsea used fewer substitutes on average than Bournemouth and Norwich.So what is going on? My argument is that the change in the number of substitutions neither harms nor benefits the teams according to their quality, but depends on other considerations.Let me explain using a scenario I have discussed with a number of coaches, players, and analysts in the Premier League and La Liga. It is far simpler than real life, but hopefully it captures the essence of the situation.Let’s take two hypothetical situations. In Situation A, substitutions during the game are forbidden. Teams start and end the game with 11 players. In Situation B, meanwhile, it is mandatory to replace the starting XI at half-time, and no other substitutions are allowed. Going from A (“No subs”) to B (“All subs”) means going from 0 to 11 substitutions, something undoubtedly much more drastic than going from three to five substitutions.In Situation B, each team experiences a change in the quality of its players in the second half. The difference between the second half and the first half depends only on how good each team’s substitutes are relative to the starting XI.In other words, whether a given team benefits depends on how its own relative change compares with the relative change of its opponent. Note that the words “strong team” or “weak team” are not used here, and therefore whether one team has a better or worse squad than another is irrelevant.Let me put it another way. Let’s assume that every team’s first team and substitutes’ bench has a quality that is measurable and can be assigned a number from 0 to 100, with 100 being best.Now imagine a match between a strong and a weak team, in which all the players are replaced at half-time. The strong team has 11 players of quality 100 and another 11 who are 60. On the other hand, a weak team has 22 identical players, all of quality equal to 20.When the starting players have to be replaced at the break, the strong team plays with quality 100 in the first half and quality 60 in the second half, while the weak team plays with quality 20 in both halves. Contrary to what many might think, under these conditions, it is clear that the weaker team prefers the situation where there are more substitutions.Of course Team B has a low chance of winning throughout. I am not disputing that. But, crucially, their chances of winning go up when 11 changes are made. The reason is that it has a more homogeneous squad, one with more similar player quality and is able to make more like-for-like substitutions.Here is another scenario. All players in the strong team have an identical quality equal to 50, while the weak team has a quality of 20 in its first XI and of 15 in its 11 substitutes. Here again the more homogeneous team – which in this case is the strong team – benefits most from a situation where there are more substitutions allowed.These simple exercises capture the essence of the impact of rule change. A team’s strength does not matter. Squads that can make more like-for-like substitutions are the ones that will benefit most from the possibility of a greater number of substitutions, regardless of their riches and thus overall level of quality of the squad. More uneven squads suffer from the rule change, regardless of how good their overall squad is.At this point you are probably thinking: “Well, your theory sounds all well and good professor, but in practice the big clubs have more homogeneous squads than smaller ones?” I wouldn’t be so sure.There is a well-known effect in football which economists refer to as the “superstar phenomenon” – whereby a small number of people earn enormous amounts and dominate the activities in which they engage. Of course it is not specific to football or even sports. There are countless examples from the world of arts and letters and showbiz where there is a strong tendency for rewards to be highly skewed toward the most talented iniduals in the activity, with very large rewards at the top and a marked skewness in the distribution of salaries.Nearly 40 years ago, Sherwin Rosen, an economist from the University of Chicago, proposed a brilliant theory to explain these general patterns. Applied to football, it means that essentially the best players reap a greater share of payroll, and this reduces the spoils available to the relatively less gifted in the squad. The superstar phenomenon, therefore, tends to increase the salary inequality both within squads and across squads.As salaries are associated with quality and performance, this pushes richer clubs to tend to have more uneven squads than lesser – in terms of money – clubs. Richer clubs would then benefit less, not more, and tend to use fewer substitutes, which is what is happening. Of course it would make sense to go through each squad inidually to make sure this is the case.Incidentally, reports have suggested that only Aston Villa, Bournemouth and West Ham voted against the rule change.

Experts answer your environmental dilemmasIdeally not (unless, of course, you are a medical professional). “If they’re single-use, the current guidance is that they should go into a bag and then into a bin, or straight into a bin if it’s a closed bin,” says Rebecca Burgess, the CEO of City to Sea, which campaigns against plastic pollution. “We really encourage everyone to make or buy a reusable mask so they don’t have that impact on the environment.”If everyone in the UK wears a disposable mask each day for a year, says Louise Edge, a senior plastics campaigner at Greenpeace, “66,000 tonnes of additional plastic waste could be produced, and we’re already using way too much plastic. Most single-use plastic masks for general public use are made from different types of plastic. Some of these plastics can’t be recycled, and waste centres can’t separate the components, so most throwaway plastic masks put in household waste will end up in landfill or incinerators. Over time, single-use plastic masks will break down into tiny microplastic particles that are too small to ever be removed from the ocean or rivers.”Reusable fabric masks are perfectly adequate for use by the general public, and some even think they are a better option than disposable masks.For the most eco-friendly option, Burgess says there are several companies making masks from secondhand or recycled material (avoiding virgin synthetic fibres). Alternatively, you can make your own, reusing fabric (there is a tutorial on the City to Sea website, and lots of others online). You may have an old shirt that no longer fits you, a bedsheet or scraps of fabric lying around.For most of us, no. TerraCycle, a company that deals with hard-to-recycle objects, has started recycling PPE through its zero waste boxes, but mainly for businesses and organisations that pay for the service – for example, a mobile phone company has just placed an order for recycling boxes to handle the masks worn by its staff. “You can pretty much recycle anything as long as you can make the economics work,” says Stephen Clarke, the head of communications for TerraCycle Europe. “The only way we can make PPE recycling work is because the end user is going to pay for that box. Your council doesn’t want this waste because it’s hard to separate out from what does have value, and if it were to recycle it, it would cost it more money than it can reclaim from that material.”“No,” says Clarke. “We don’t have a programme for wipes at the moment.” And don’t flush them down the loo.It is important to wash masks after each use, says Maitreyi Shivkumar, a virologist and lecturer in molecular biology at De Montfort University Leicester. But, she says, “there’s no concrete evidence” on how to do the laundry. NHS guidelines on the home-washing of work uniforms advises washing with detergent at 60C (140F). For the public, “the likelihood of you coming into contact with really high amounts of virus is relatively low. It’s unlikely you’ll need to use a high temperature.”PPE is becoming a visible form of litter. “There are lots of hazards to wildlife from plastic of all shapes and sizes, such as getting tangled, eating it, choking, feeding it to young and using it for nests,” says Edge.If you see discarded masks and gloves, what should you do? “The guidance is you shouldn’t pick them up with your bare hands because they may be contaminated,” says Burgess. “Inform the local council or park wardens.” She suggests that if you’re a keen litter-picker, it’s worthwhile investing in a litter pick – one of those sticks with a grabber at the end. “They’re great if you want to start helping our environment by collecting any litter – I’d get a secondhand litter pick.”Almost certainly not, although there were reports in the past week that ministers are looking into whether to encourage it. “I’ve seen people wear gloves, and I think it makes them feel like they’re protected, but just wearing gloves doesn’t mean that the virus isn’t going to get on the gloves and then whatever you touch,” says Shivkumar. “I think it gives people a false sense of security. The latex ones, which don’t absorb water, are likely to actually keep the droplets with the virus on there for longer. I think people shouldn’t be concerned about wearing gloves. Just wash your hands, and be aware of not touching your face.”Disposable gloves “are a real problem environmentally”, says Mark Miodownik, a professor of materials and society at University College London, who heads the Plastic Waste Innovation Hub. “I’ve seen people throwing them on the floor. And yet they are no help in reducing the risk of the spread. No one should be wearing gloves in public – it makes no sense.”Lots of public interactions are now performed through a plastic screen. “Acrylic is recyclable and screens are sheet form and big enough to be of economic value at the end of their life, so I’m not too worried about that, as long as people do recycle them,” says Miodownik, though he adds he’s doubtful about their efficacy.A bar of soap can have less packaging than a (plastic) bottle of handwash, leaving aside the intricate pump that is hard to recycle. Old-fashioned soap, says Shivkumar, “is absolutely fine. Anything that is a detergent will destruct the lipid biolayer shell of the virus.” Look for bars with minimal or no packaging, says Edge. “If you prefer to use soap pumps,” she says, “try a refill service.”Shivkumar thinks handwashing is better than gel: “It’s more thorough, I think. Only use the alcohol gels when you don’t have any other option.” Where alternatives don’t exist, some plastic items will still be needed, Edge accepts. “If it’s convenient for people to decant their hand sanitiser into a small reusable container from a big refill bottle, that’s great, and can help reduce plastic waste, but that may not be easy or possible for everyone.”Starbucks and Pret a Manger were among chains that said they could no longer accept reusable cups because the increased touch could spread the infection, but Burgess says it’s fine to use one “as long as they’re washed properly and there’s a process to follow”. City to Sea has launched a “contactless coffee” campaign to encourage cafes and chains to accept reusable cups again, which involves the customer putting their lidless cup on a designated tray. “They move that tray rather than touching the cup itself, so there is no contamination.” You should wash your cup regularly, which may mean washing it with handwash if you’re out for the day (and giving it a good wash at home).Shivkumar is hesitant to say using a reusable cup is completely safe. “It’s important to think about what the risk is and how the risk can be minimised,” she says. “In a situation where if you are increasing the number of people you – or the cup – are coming into contact with, that is going to increase the risk. I don’t think there’s a black-and-white answer to this.”However, a statement, signed by 130 academics, scientists and health professionals, came out recently to say it was safe to use reusable cups and bottles. “They highlighted the importance of washing them thoroughly in hot water and detergent or soap, and said to avoid touching the lid or drinking area,” says Edge. “Lots of cafes have put systems in place so that reusable cups can be used safely with social distancing and no-contact processes to keep customers and staff safe.”Asking yourself that question would be Burgess’s advice. “Takeaway packaging, plastic or not, has flooded the market,” she says, as even restaurants that previously didn’t offer takeaway food now do. Carry your own cutlery if you’re out and about to reduce the use of disposable versions. “If you’re using an online platform, click off the single-use cutlery and small sachets of ketchup option,” she says, if there is one. “That’s a quick win.” She knows of a coffee shop that accepts customers’ own containers so it’s worth trying to encourage others to do the same. “If you can get out and pick up your food, ask them if they can use your plastic container if you take it in for them to pack.”The boom in online shopping hasn’t only deluged Jeff Bezos’s bank account – it has swamped the world with packaging. “I think we really need to start addressing our consumerism and the amount we’re buying, whether that’s food, luxury goods, clothes or more,” says Burgess. “Is that thing you’re buying to replace something or can you repair the original? Can you buy secondhand? There might have been some interesting pop-ups around reuse and repair opening during this time. Connect into any community platforms, just to see whether there’s an alternative, before you buy something new.”For many, getting groceries delivered has been a lifeline, but for others, it may have fostered bad habits (the supermarkets, too, have been insisting on delivering in plastic bags). “There have been a lot of changes in shopping habits over the past few months,” says Burgess. “We’d encourage people to try to shop as plastic-free as possible, so using your local greengrocer and butchers, using your own bags.” Alternatively, look for plastic-free delivery companies, such as a glass milk-bottle delivery. “A local veg box is a really good way to get rid of plastic from the supply chain,” says Miodownik. The produce is seasonal, “and these companies tend to be local, which really need people’s custom”. When shopping in the supermarket, you may be reassured by plastic – Miodownik observes that many people seem keener to buy a bag of apples over loose ones. “It’s under this false assumption that it’s going to make it safer, but the plastic itself is just as likely to have the virus on as the apples, and it is actually viable for longer on plastic than most other materials. It’s an illusion of safety, but that’s how plastic has become so popular.” Edge adds that buying loose produce not only means “one less item of plastic degrading in the environment it also sends a message to companies that people prefer to avoid plastic”.It can be one way of cutting down on emissions – though still far worse, environmentally speaking, than walking, cycling or using public transport – but how safe is it? “I don’t think carsharing is a good idea,” says Shivkumar. “If you are carsharing with someone different every day, that increases the risk, whereas if it’s with the same person that’s probably safer. But you’d have to keep in mind that if someone in your family or theirs tested positive, both households would have to self-isolate.” Having the windows open would be a good idea, and she advises people to wear a mask, “because it is a confined, small space with not much airflow”. The government says “you should try not to” carshare with people outside your household or bubble."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71c303a94d081b73efa7dac755ea2784071f634c/0_251_3952_2371/master/3952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ebed5064dbcfe28c3ffc460dbebfb11","title":"uk bike repair voucher website struggles at launch","story":"Cyclists voice disappointment as website offering repair vouchers crashes after going liveBoris Johnson’s ambitious plan to get people in England cycling has got off to a wobbly start, with the website offering bicycle repair vouchers crashing at launch.As part of the prime minister’s £2bn scheme to boost active travel, the UK government has made 50,000 “fix your bike” vouchers available in England to be used for standard servicing and replacing components.The website, fixyourbikevoucherscheme.est.org.uk, was due to go live at 11.45pm on Tuesday. However, initial efforts to access the site returned an “Error 404” message.The scope of the problem quickly became evident as cyclists expressed their disappointment on social media.The volume of complaints was such that the hashtag #FixYourBikeVoucherScheme became the number one trend on Twitter in the UK within 90 minutes of the site’s scheduled launch.The website finally began working at about 4am, though some errors are persisting.The vouchers were initially due to be available in June, but the Department for Transport (DfT) said last month they would be released only once maintenance shops could handle the expected increase in demand.A Department for Transport (DfT) spokesman said on Wednesday: “The Fix Your Bike voucher scheme website was taken offline by the Energy Saving Trust this morning following high levels of interest. Vouchers are being released gradually to reflect the capacity of cycle repairers signed up to the scheme and more will be available soon.”The £2bn investment, announced in February, also includes thousands of miles of new protected cycle lanes, cycle training, making electric bikes more accessible and creating the UK’s first zero-emission transport city.Other measures include strengthening the highway code, improving legal protections, increasing lorry safety standards and working with the police and retailers to tackle bike thefts.On a visit to Nottingham, Johnson said: “You always could spend more and this is the most ambitious package ever – it’s £2bn.“What we will do is create thousands of miles of protected cycle lanes – I really believe that protected cycle lanes are essential to give people the confidence people need.Many people aren’t very brave or confident cyclists.”He added: “What I also want to see is more work done to get motorists to understand that we are all going to be sharing the roads, going to be sharing it with cyclists, so be respectful, be courteous.“Things have been improving but there’s still a long way to go.”Labour’s shadow cycling minister, Kerry McCarthy, said: “Tory ministers have dragged their feet and failed to seize the opportunity this crisis has posed. Although funding is welcome, cyclists will be rightly concerned about how long it is going to take to actually put these plans into practice.”DfT figures show there has been a surge in the popularity of cycling during the coronavirus outbreak.• The headline and text of this article were amended on 29 July 2020 to clarify that the scheme covers England only, not the entire UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eca0004c7ff0506ba96cc958f2708900f5839e19/452_67_4917_2951/master/4917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=840e99965477beca766d5bc46cc6f82d","title":"unwind in malta your long weekend itinerary for a dose of r and r","story":"With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, it’s always the right time to kick back and relax in this culture-rich countryWritten about by Homer as the archipelago where the nymph Calypso so beguiled Ulysses that he stayed for seven years, the Maltese islands remain idyllically beautiful. They offer visitors spectacular beaches, cobalt sea, prehistoric sites dating back more than 5,000 years, and soul-soothingly beautiful natural landscapes. With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta is ideal for some restorative R\u0026ampR, and you can get here with minimal stress, no jet lag, and only a short-haul flight from the UK.Day one: soak up VallettaStart to unwind in Valletta, Malta’s elegant coastal capital, where five-star and boutique hotels offer spa treatments, massages and hot tubs and pools overlooking beautiful views. You could spend your first day exploring some of the attractions of this Unesco world heritage site, one of the world’s most beautiful and unspoilt cities. Its pedestrianised centre is full of pavement cafes to relax and enjoy a drink in the warm sunshine. You can dine in the evening at outdoor, sea-facing restaurants, eating fresh seafood and other delicious local cuisine, and enjoy the warm Mediterranean sun.Day two: more spas, speedboats and the ‘silent city’Valletta is renowned for its spectacular boutique hotels, such as the glorious Palazzo Consiglia with an underground spa and rooftop pool. One suite in SU29 has a rooftop Jacuzzi-with-a-view, as do the suites in the historic townhouse of Casa Ellul. Locanda La Gelsomina, over the harbour in the even-more-relaxing small town of Birgu, offers in-house massages, private yoga and a Japanese Zen sound bath.Once you’ve spent a day smoothing out any knots, it’s an easy trip by bus or car to take it easy on the beautiful beaches of Golden Bay or Għajn Tuffieħa for a day of beach relaxation. This astoundingly scenic chain of soft-sanded beaches is lapped by the warm Mediterranean Sea, and offers every kind of watersports: indulge in some stand-up paddleboarding, waterskiing or take a speedboat along the coast to see the otherworldly rock formations and caves that glint with reflected blue light. The beachfront Radisson Blu Resort \u0026amp Spa has superb spa facilities, or you could base yourself in a seaside town such as Mellieħa, close to another white-sanded beach, with lots of hotel choices.A cobweb-clearing walk along Malta’s Dingli cliffs offers sweeping panoramas for miles across the ocean, and you could finish the day with a meal in the tranquil “silent city” of Mdina. This hilltop, walled, golden-stone old capital, with its atmospheric and historic narrow lanes, is best experienced after all the daytime visitors have ebbed away.Days three and four: go Zen in GozoOn your third and fourth days, slow down your pace even more by heading to the neighbouring smaller island of Gozo, only a short trip by ferry. Hidden coves are reached via flights of vertiginous steps, with pale copper sands lapped by azure waters. Artist and poet Edward Lear visited in the 19th century and was so taken with this curious, dramatic landscape that he invented words to describe it: calling it “pomskizillious” and “gromophiberous”.Gozo’s country roads are ideal for cycling or walks, with sea views and seemingly hugely outsized churches in the middle of the countryside. The island’s famous for the warmth and hospitality of its locals, and is the kind of place where no one bothers locking their front door. Gozo is famous for its large, rentable “farmhouses” with gardens and pools, as well as some spectacular hotels, such as chic haven ThirtySeven and the five-star hideaway Kempinski Hotel San Lawrenz. You can also dine on spectacular fresh Mediterranean produce here. Gozo has many renowned restaurants, serving zero-mileage local cuisine cooked by some of the best chefs on the archipelago, with ingredients such as the local fresh cheese, locally grown tomatoes and olives, fresh fish, and local wines.Gozo’s five-star spas offer a wide range of treatments and therapies from across the world as well as saunas, Jacuzzis, steam rooms and indoor swimming pools.A longer restIf two days isn’t long enough, extend your Gozo trip with yoga and pilates retreats, which are ideal for longer wellness stays. The week-long Paola’s BodyBarre retreat, for example, gives you the chance to take part in daily pilates, barre, fitness and yoga fusion sessions, as well as excursions to copper-sanded Ramla Bay, the cerulean Blue Lagoon, Gozo’s coastal salt pans, and the vast Ġgantija temples, which predate Stonehenge. The next retreat will take place in 2021, for more information email: office.uk@visitmalta.It’s remarkable how many relaxation and wellness activities you can fit in over a four-day weekend trip to Malta, recharging in beautiful settings or keeping active outdoors (although longer trips to Malta and Gozo are to be encouraged – there’s a lot that cannot be covered in a four-day trip). Book your wellness trip to Malta today to restore a sense of balance, for a holiday whose effects will last long after your return.In the wake of Covid-19 things are changing fast, so do check the latest advice from the Foreign Office before making any travel decisions and contact any hotels, restaurants or attractions mentioned in this article for the latest information on availability and opening times.

But on stage at the Montreux Jazz festival in 1976, dressed in a form-fitting black dress with her hair cropped short, Simone cut a different figure from the one for which she is remembered. The piano virtuoso, who usually kept audiences eating out of the palm of her hand, seemed skittish and disoriented.Set along the shores of picturesque Lac Léman, Montreux Jazz is a glitzy affair in one of the world’s most expensive countries. Simone performed at the festival several times between 1968 and 1990, but by the time she got to Switzerland in 1976, she was broke. She had left her husband and the United States in the early 70s, worn out by an abusive marriage, the loss of great friends including Lorraine Hansberry and Langston Hughes, the toll of the civil rights fight and the career consequences of prioritising activism in her music over radio-friendly fare.She went to Liberia, where she found romance and fulfilment, but her career and finances fell apart. To make money, she tried her luck in Switzerland instead of returning to the US. The Montreux show was, at its core, a business decision.Rumours have swirled about what her life looked like when she arrived in Switzerland in 76 the move must have been destabilising, a dramatic change from the life she had in Liberia. A certain unease was clear from the moment she flitted awkwardly on to the stage at Montreux Casino, and what followed was a series of contradictions and eccentricities.Simone seemed shaky at times, standing next to her piano and steadying herself while staring blankly out into the crowd a few minutes later she was solid, crouching in a squat in high heels and holding a prayer pose. Her repartee with the audience betrayed shyness and vulnerability, and a wish to win the spectators over. Then she told them that she was writing a new song but they weren’t worthy of hearing it.Watching it now, it’s hard to glean exactly what Simone had in her heart she tries to externalise her inner monologues but never quite gets it right. Her song choice suggests that she had moved away from the protest music that defined her career in the 60s, although she kept in a few concert staples: Backlash Blues, I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free, Be My Husband and the opener Little Girl Blue, a throwback to her first album.When her own words failed her, she looked to other singers for lyrics to convey what she couldn’t quite express. In the most affecting part of the performance, Simone covered Janis Ian’s Stars, a sombre tune about artists past their prime (“Some of us are downed  Some of us are crowned  And some are lost  And never found”). This part of the performance did, however, contain a classic example of Simone’s verve, when she admonished a concertgoer for trying to leave the casino hall before the song was over. “Hey girl, sit down. Sit down! Sit down!”From Stars, Simone moved to a rousing cover of Morris Albert’s Feelings, giving the often-mocked tune a new shine. Her rendition is padded by off-the-cuff rhapsodising that extends to 10 minutes, mimicking the freestyle nature of the church revivals that she attended as a child with her mother. Yet she brings depth to an otherwise simple song, the emotion written on her face and thrashed out on the keys.Simone’s prowess on the piano and her exceptional baritone were intact, but the 76 Montreux show can be difficult to watch. She tried her hardest to coax energy and applause out of a tough and conservative Swiss audience, using unpredictable methods. She’s tired and sad and it’s an unsteady step back into the limelight. But you root for her earnestness, honesty, vulnerability and superior talent – and she wins you over because she’s unforgettable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ee4649f9e9b81ed676930d072bf215d3b660a7e/0_127_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=683bd3d16d59b974317a1ec79c8bc64e","title":"mahler where to start with his music","story":"Conceived on a massive scale, Gustav Mahler’s seismic symphonies draw on the folk poetry of his native Bohemia and include the longest ever written by a major composerDuring his lifetime and in the decades after his death, Gustav Mahler (1860-1911) was primarily regarded as an outstanding conductor. It has only been in the last 60 years or so that his significance as a composer has been fully appreciated. Now, his symphonies are seen as perhaps the most important since Beethoven’s, linking the romanticism of the 19th century with the modernism of the 20th, and only rivalled for originality among his contemporaries by those of Sibelius.Mahler’s symphonies and songs have regularly been plundered to accompany visual images: research in 2008 found over 120 examples of his music being used in cinema and television. The most famous example is on the soundtrack to Luchino Visconti’s Death in Venice in 1971, which uses both the Adagietto from the Fifth Symphony and the fourth-movement setting of Nietzsche from the Third, while an episode in the second season of the TV series Fargo (“Fear and Trembling”) features an arrangement of the opening of the Second Symphony and an excerpt from the finale of Das Lied von der Erde.Mahler was a Bohemian, born in Kaliště, a village now in the Czech Republic but then in the Austrian empire. He was the second of 14 children a few months after his birth, the family moved to the town of Jihlava, where his father opened a distillery and tavern. The Mahlers were Jewish and German-speaking in a region where most people spoke Czech, and Gustav thought of himself as an exile, “always an outsider, never made welcome”. But the sounds of his childhood – folk tunes, street songs and military bands – haunted his music for much of his life. By 10 he was already recognised as a musical wunderkind, and in 1875 he went to study at the Vienna Conservatory. He was primarily as a pianist, but he also took composition lessons and started to conduct.Mahler began his conducting career in 1880, working in provincial opera houses across Austria and Germany. He reportedly discarded most of the music he composed during these years (there’s a theory that some of his early manuscripts were destroyed in the allied bombing of Dresden in 1945), but one large-scale work – the cantata Das klagende Lied, completed in 1880 – survived.Though orchestras apparently disliked his authoritarianism, appointments in Prague and Leipzig from 1885 to 1887 confirmed Mahler’s rising reputation as a conductor. During this period he completed his first orchestral song cycle, Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen (Songs of a Wayfarer), with texts modelled on poems in Des Knaben Wunderhorn, an early 19th-century collection of German folk poetry that would dominate his music for more than a decade.In 1888, he completed his First Symphony, conceiving it as a five-movement symphonic poem under the title of Titan and incorporating melodies from his song cycle eventually he dropped one movement, creating the work we usually hear today. That same year, he sketched a single-movement symphonic poem, Totenfeier (Funeral Rites), which became the opening movement of his Second Symphony, the Resurrection. Conceived on a massive scale, the Second followed Beethoven’s Ninth in requiring vocal soloists and a chorus, as well as a huge orchestra.In 1894, when Mahler finished work on the Second, he was living in Hamburg, where he’d been chief conductor at the Stadttheater since 1891. Composing took second place to conducting, though he did complete more Wunderhorn songs, and conducted the premiere of his Second Symphony in Berlin in 1895. He’d already begun a Third Symphony, conceived on an even more expansive scale than its predecessor. At around 100 minutes, it’s the longest symphony ever written by a major composer. Of all his works, it’s the one that most completely confirms what he told Sibelius in 1907: “A symphony must be like the world, it must embrace everything.”The Third Symphony was not premiered until 1902, after he had finished the Fourth Symphony, the last one linked to the Wunderhorn world. Mahler had settled in Vienna, having been appointed to the Hofoper (the Court Opera – today’s State Opera) in 1897 after converting to Catholicism, aware that a Jew would not gain such a prestigious post.Vienna was about to become one of the centres of modernism in Europe, perhaps rivalled only by Paris as a centre of radical art in the years before the first world war. In 1897, the painter Gustav Klimt helped found the Vienna Secession, while the seeds of expressionism were sown with the publication of Sigmund Freud’s book The Interpretation of Dreams two years later, and taken up in the next decade by poets such as Georg Trakl. Mahler found himself feted by the composers of the Second Viennese School, headed by Arnold Schoenberg, who with his pupils Alban Berg and Anton Webern viewed Mahler’s symphonies as signposts to the direction their own music would take.The Fifth was the start of a trilogy of purely orchestral symphonies, which Mahler completed by 1905, along with settings of poems by Friedrich Rückert that became the orchestral song cycles Rückert Lieder and Kindertotenlieder (Songs on the Deaths of Children).If the Seventh Symphony remains one of Mahler’s most enigmatic works, the Sixth is one of his greatest achievements, with a finale punctuated by three huge hammer blows – the third of which, according to Alma, fells the hero of the symphony “like a tree”. The superstitious composer removed the third blow from the score after the first performance in 1906, but Alma identified the blows with seismic events in Mahler’s life the following year: the death of their daughter Maria, his own diagnosis of a potentially fatal heart condition, and his forced resignation from the Hofoper, supposedly because he was spending too much time composing.By the beginning of 1908, Mahler was conducting in New York. as director of the politan Opera. His performances there were generally successful, but he resigned the following year to take up a post with the New York Philharmonic. Summers were spent back in Austria composing, with Das Lied von der Erde beginning a final trilogy of works premiered after Mahler’s death. But the massive, choral Eighth Symphony, the so-called Symphony of a Thousand, which he’d completed in 1906, stands apart from the works on either side of it. Its premiere in Munich in 1910 was one of the biggest triumphs of Mahler’s life, and the last time he conducted the first performance of one of his works: he died eight months later in Vienna.Das Lied von der Erde (The Song of the Earth), which Mahler superstitiously avoided describing as his “ninth symphony” because so many composers had died after completing nine symphonies, is a song cycle with the dimensions of a symphony, ending with a half-hour movement, Abschied, that seems a very conscious farewell to life. Yet having lived to complete it, Mahler did write a Ninth Symphony – his astonishingly moving acceptance of the inevitability of death – and began a Tenth too, a much more autobiographical work riven with fears and doubts after his discovery of Alma’s affair with the young architect Walter Gropius.Mahler died having completed two movements of the Tenth and made extensive drafts for the other three. A number of completions of the whole work have been made from these drafts, of which that by the British musicologist Deryck Cooke has proved the most convincing and widely performed.Mahler was revered by Schoenberg and his pupils, but his influence extended much further into the 20th century. Dmitri Shostakovich’s symphonies and Benjamin Britten’s orchestral writing both owe it a significant debt, and composers of the post-1945 avant garde admired him too. Pierre Boulez recorded all the symphonies, while in the third movement of his Sinfonia, Luciano Berio used the scherzo from Mahler’s Second Symphony as the framework for a virtuoso collage of musical quotations ranging from Bach to Stockhausen.For more than 30 years after his death, only a few conductors bothered with Mahler’s music. The Dutch conductor Willem Mengelberg ploughed a solitary furrow promoting his cause at the Amsterdam Concergebouw – though other than a performance of the Fourth Symphony, none of Mengelberg’s Mahler seems to be available on disc. Leonard Bernstein was one of the leaders of the Mahler renaissance when it began in earnest in the 1960s, while Bernard Haitink continued the Mahler tradition at the Concertgebouw. In the digital era, the cycles by Claudio Abbado (Deutsche Grammophon) and Riccardo Chailly (Decca) have been pre-eminent. Other great conductors such as Otto Klemperer and Herbert von Karajan were more selective in the works they tackled, though some of their recordings – Klemperer’s accounts of the Second Symphony and Das Lied von der Erde, and especially Karajan’s elegiac version of the Ninth – are among the finest Mahler recordings of all time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfbb863e1f3d6dd52ff4a0e15dc8d7cf7e202d5d/0_138_4143_2486/master/4143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2d3a8e716672764a63a06a96904ef0c","title":"mps may have been misled over bame voter id claims","story":"Electoral Commission says data that proves voter ID doesn’t discriminate against BAME people doesn’t existThe government may have misled MPs over mandatory voter ID, after it was revealed the data cited by a minister to prove the system does not discriminate against BAME voters does not exist.Labour has said the disconnect between the Cabinet Office’s statement and the Electoral Commission’s evidence will raise questions over whether the government has examined any evidence on the impact on ethnic minority voters of requiring voters to bring ID in order to vote.Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said in June that “the evidence shows there is no impact on any particular demographic group … the evidence of our pilots shows that there is no impact on any particular demographic group from this policy.”Asked for the evidence in a written question last month, Smith said: “Based on the independent Electoral Commission’s evaluations of the 2018 and 2019 voter ID pilots, there is no indication that any consistent demographic was adversely affected by the use of voter ID.”However, in both of its most recent reports, the Electoral Commission said it had no way of measuring the effect of voter ID on minority ethnic communities’ votes.“Polling station staff were not asked to collect demographic data about the people who did not come back, owing to the practical challenges involved in carrying out that data collection exercise,” the body’s 2019 report said.“That means we have no direct evidence to tell us whether people from particular backgrounds were more likely than others to find it hard to show ID.”The 2019 report found in Derby, one of the pilot areas, that there was a strong correlation between the proportion of each ward’s population from an Asian background and the number of people not issued with a ballot paper – similar to a 2018 finding in Watford.However, the body cautioned against drawing any conclusions from that data and said there was not yet sufficient evidence in either direction.Cat Smith, the shadow minister for voter engagement, said the Windrush scandal had shown how some communities had face severe consequences when they had no official documentation.“The government continue to plough on with voter ID plans, turning a blind eye how this could disenfranchise ethnic minorities,” she said. “The government have stated repeatedly on record that evidence concludes voter ID has no impact on any particular demographic group. This is simply not true, the evidence does not exist.“If these US-style voter suppression plans go ahead, we could see BAME communities locked out of democracy. The government must correct the record and recognise the damaging impact that mandatory voter ID will have upon minority ethnic groups.”In a series of Freedom of Information requests by the Labour party, the government has also said it does not hold data on the possession of ID by ethnicity.Voting rights groups expressed serious concern at the findings. Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said ministers had “apparently failed to gather any evidence” and said it was “baffling and looks deeply misleading”. He said the ERS research suggested the policy will disproportionately hit people of colour, older voters and those on low-incomes.Sam Grant, policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said: “The fact the government doesn’t have the evidence to understand what impact this will have shows it is disregarding these risks and trying to plough ahead with plans that threaten the basic foundations of our democratic system.”In a statement, Smith said voter ID was “a reasonable way to combat the inexcusable potential for voter fraud in our current system and strengthen its integrity”. Smith added that there was a “wealth of evidence to show that voter ID does not impact voter turnout” including its operation in Northern Ireland for several decades and said the studies had shown the overwhelming majority of people cast their vote successfully in the pilot schemes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05808bc124ab21f85528dfece236d611daef437f/121_0_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8cc95ca797efe95398238f11d10c8ef","title":"virgin galactic offers peek inside new space plane for tourists","story":"Inside of VSS Unity unveiled, showing the cabin in which six passengers will be able to float in zero gravity on the edge of spaceVirgin Galactic has revealed the interior of its centrepiece space plane, showing off a cabin with new custom seats and a “space mirror” in a virtual tour of what its passengers can expect to experience on flights to the edge of space.For $250,000 a ticket, passengers who have signed up for the suborbital flight aboard the air-launched plane VSS Unity will strap into six tailored seats and be able to peer out of the cabin’s 12 circular windows as they ascend 97km (60 miles) above Earth. The plane has five other windows.Virgin Galactic chief space officer George Whitesides said passengers could unbuckle themselves at peak altitude to float around the cabin in zero-gravity conditions.The company has 600 customers signed up to fly and at least 400 more who have expressed interest, Whitesides said. No date has been set for its first commercial space flight. British founder Sir Richard Branson is expected to be aboard.Virgin Galactic has never made a profit and has been plagued by successive delays. Branson said last year he hoped to make the first trip “in months, not years” after securing £60m of deposits.The cabin also features a large, circular mirror in the back “to allow our customers to see themselves in space in a way that has really never been done before,” Whitesides said.The plane, attached to a bigger carrier plane, is intended to take off from the company’s New Mexico spaceport and detach mid-air to launch further toward the edge of space in a trip lasting 90 minutes.Virgin Galactic is vying for space tourism supremacy with the SpaceX project launched by the Tesla founder, Elon Musk, and the Blue Origin venture headed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person.Branson floated the business on the stock market in October, securing $450m of funding through a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia, an investment vehicle run by the former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0a66f9c2f5ce10a70ce344e84a7f531bac2548e/0_207_4621_2774/master/4621.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=432be5a684d25339718c64ef828276da","title":"stuart broad says hes improving with age after 501st test wicket","story":"Stuart Broad plans to follow his “idol” Jimmy Anderson by ploughing on in Test cricket for some time yet, after he burst through the 500-wicket barrier as the driving force behind England’s 2-1 series victory against West Indies.Broad had questioned where his career was going after the 34-year-old was left out of the first Test in Southampton. But by the end of a second convincing win for Joe Root’s side in Manchester – a 269-run victory sealed with his 10th victim of the match – such thoughts had dissipated and with good reason.By scorching 16 wickets at 11 runs apiece across his two Tests Broad convinced himself more golden years lie ahead having become the seventh man to pass 500 Test wickets by removing Kraigg Brathwaite – the same batsman when Anderson passed the milestone three years ago – the template for doing so is obvious.Broad said: “A couple of weeks ago I was in a bit of a thinking place. I thought: ‘Where am I going here?’ But I’m glad I stayed strong because I’m very happy two weeks later. To get to 500 is a special feeling.“You always hear ex-sportsmen saying they knew when it was time to go, they lost that feeling. Well, I’ve still got it in abundance. I’m someone who looks pretty short-term but at the moment I feel fresh, I feel fit.“Jimmy is my idol on that. He turns 38 soon and he’s someone who I have watched very closely, a great friend of mine for many years. Over the last few years, he has maintained himself and kept upskilling himself to be able to not only compete but get better at this level.“If you look at both of our records over the last few years, we are actually improving. Compare my last 18 months to my career record and it’s way better, which is always a great sign.”Broad, who nudged out Ben Stokes as man of the series despite the all-rounder’s 363 runs at 90 with the bat and nine wickets, was keen that Chris Woakes keep the match ball after West Indies were bowled out for 129 in 37.1 overs chasing 399 on a rain-affected final day.Woakes had picked up his fourth Test five-wicket haul with figures of five for 50 to show the depth England have in the seam department at home. Had Stokes not been unable to bowl in this match because of a thigh injury, he or Jofra Archer would likely not have played.Root, whose players now spend a few days home before returning to Manchester for the first Test against Pakistan starting next Wednesday, was asked if he will stick with the same attack, even if Stokes is fully fit once more. The captain replied: “It’s definitely on the table isn’t it? It’s hard to leave anyone out.“Long may those headaches continue. I think, for now it’s important that everyone just goes away, has some time away from cricket, away from this bubble not thinking about things for a couple of days.“It’s shown character to come back from 1-0 down and we’ve not wavered from how we want to play. We’re looking to start better than here and buck that trend, that’s a big challenge for us come the Pakistan series.”On Broad’s desire to keep going, Root said: “I really hope that’s the case. As I said about Stokes last week, we’ve got to realise how lucky we are to be in the presence of these guys, time and time again putting in brilliant performances.”Just three seamers sit ahead of Broad’s 501 Test wickets on the all-time list, with Anderson 11 short of 600, Australia’s Glenn McGrath finishing on 563 and Courtney Walsh, who congratulated him on Twitter, on 519.Asked if another seamer may join them one day, Broad replied: “Someone is going to have to play a lot of cricket because there is a lot of competition out there with different T20 leagues. I think there’s talk of thinning the amount of Tests we play in a summer down, too.“You need a lot of Test matches to get 500 wickets. I think there’ll be people who have the talent to get the numbers but whether they’ll be able to play the amount of Test cricket the seam bowlers have done to get that feat remains to be seen.”On the possibility of even surpassing Anderson’s final tally one day, Broad replied: “If I keep bowling the way I am for the next few years then I wouldn’t rule anything out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ed035534696c561b4efb885f91290d26c575d0/721_539_5421_3253/master/5421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=376d9961d5de3a6e80415b67e9049346","title":"ruqsana begum felt so much pressure arranged marriage sport muay thai kickboxing boxing","story":"The former Muay Thai world champion on arranged marriage, chronic fatigue syndrome, gym bullies and early wobbles in boxingShe cries during our long interview on a hazy summer afternoon in Bethnal Green but never loses her composure. Each time the former kickboxing dynamo wipes away her tears, laughs a little while saying sorry, and continues. “Those moments have led me to this moment,” she says after one poignant pause, “where I now manage to not look for approval from outside. Rather, I go inwards and find strength from within.”Begum reiterates her passion for fighting and her certainty that she can still become a success in her new sport of boxing despite the odds stacked against her. “I do love it. Stepping into the ring allows you to grow because you’re putting yourself in such depths of fear. And when you overcome that there’s such a sense of accomplishment. I love that and the fact I’m constantly working towards my goal, and progressing, even if I sometimes lose.”She is a petite 36-year-old, a warm and reflective woman who also has a degree in architecture. At 5ft 3in, she does not look like a fighter. And so it’s strange, at first, to reconcile the fact that the violent backdrop of Muay Thai and boxing have brought serenity into Begum’s often turbulent world.“I think any creative art form, whether music or dance, Muay Thai or boxing, allows you to channel emotion and express yourself,” she says. “I was fortunate to have discovered Thai boxing when I had few other opportunities to express myself. I found my passion in life and realised I was good at it. But it’s like anything in life – talent is nothing without sacrifice. There needs to be hard work. There needs to be discipline and focus.“So when I had all those problems I didn’t blame others. I took responsibility and said: ‘OK, this is where I am. How do I move forward?’ I found the best way to heal myself is through sport. So I’m really grateful for having Muay Thai and now boxing in my life.”Begum’s new book, Born Fighter, provides an absorbing insight into the obstacles she faced. It is written with Sarah Shephard and the two women, from Muslim and Jewish backgrounds, complement each other as we learn how Begum hid her passion for Thai boxing from her family for many years. She was torn between her desire to be a dutiful Muslim daughter and a darker yearning to discover her real self in the ring.The KO Combat Academy, where much of the book is set, is located under an arch in a backstreet of Bethnal Green. Trains clatter overhead and it makes me think how intimidating it must have been for a teenage Bangladeshi girl to approach a gym. “The original gym was across the road,” Begum explains, “and I can’t believe I had the courage to walk in. This is now more a commercial gym whereas back then it was hardcore. It was just fighters.”Bill Judd, who trained Begum to her world championship, welcomes us today. He was just as accepting, if initially surprised, when the 18-year-old Begum told him she wanted to be a fighter. She could cover the bruises on her arms and legs, which she took from kicks, but she became adept at avoiding blows to her face. And when she was marked up her sister helped her hide the damage or she pulled her hijab more closely around her face.Five years later Begum was forced to abandon Muay Thai. She was coerced into an arranged marriage by her family – who meant well in adhering to the traditions of their culture. “I was 23 and it was overwhelming,” Begum recalls. “I thought: ‘Whoa, I need to take a breath because I don’t even know him.’ I felt so much pressure to go along with it so I tried to speak to my mum. She waved me away and was very dismissive. They made it clear this was going to happen.”Begum stresses that her husband, a banker from east London, was not a monster. Her book’s most harrowing pages detail how she felt trapped and suffocated living with her husband’s family who expected her to do so many chores on their behalf. “I was oppressed,” she says. “I didn’t have that freedom to say: ‘I’m feeling a bit tired so I’ll do the washing in an hour.’ I was constantly trying to please them but whatever I did wasn’t enough. At the same time I’d started a high-pressure job as a trainee architect. Eventually it took a toll on me.”Begum details the severe panic attacks which engulfed her after nine months. Her doctor advised her to move back to her parents. She was in a terrible state and only the eventual understanding of her parents stabilised her. What would have happened if they had insisted she return to her marriage? “I would have stood my ground and said no. But it would have been a battle to find the courage and strength – especially when I was very vulnerable. My father was in two minds. But my mum and older brother were like: ‘No, she has to go back. This is the tradition.’ I tried to explain it to my father after one of my therapy sessions. And his reaction wasn’t good. But at that point my ex-husband filed for orce and I was thinking: ‘God, it’s the biggest relief.’ My parents understood then what I had been through.“I was on antidepressants for four months and completely bedridden. But I didn’t want to be on antidepressants because they numb you. The only thing I remembered enjoying was Muay Thai and so I told myself: ‘Get back to the gym.’ One day I asked my parents to drop me off when they were coming to Whitechapel to shop. I then said: ‘Actually, can you come in with me?’ I introduced them to Bill.”The trainer outlined the discipline of the sport and stressed how Begum was so respectful, and respectable, in the gym. Her parents agreed she could return. But new problems soon emerged. Begum cries when she tells me how she was bullied by other female fighters at the gym.“It went on for five years and Bill kept saying to me: ‘Why don’t you just leave and go to another gym?’ I thought: ‘No. I don’t want to be pushed out.’ Bill hated it but his focus was on that group of girls. I wish he supported me more because I just wanted equal treatment. So it really broke my heart and that’s why I’m torn about this place. I’ve had some amazing moments here but also a lot of pain.”Begum shocked everyone in 2011 by becoming a European champion in Latvia without having anyone in her corner. A Danish trainer in the crowd ran to help her when he saw Begum was on her own between rounds.Over the next few years Judd worked more closely with Begum and helped her become a world champion kickboxer in 2016. In the week of her defining fight against Susanna Salmijärvi, her ME was so debilitating that Begum was stunned when she passed a medical to fight. “I was bed-bound the whole week so I said to Bill: ‘I’m too weak to even do a warm-up. Just put me in the ring. If anything happens, throw in the towel. But give me the first round so I have those two minutes to try and knock her out. This is an opportunity I’ll never get again.’ I had enough energy for two minutes which could define the rest of my life.”She came close to an early knockout but her opponent got up and, at the end of a brutal fight, Begum absorbed sustained punishment. She had done just enough to become world champion and, as she says now, “It was a 10-year journey and my first thought was: ‘Thank you, God.’”When she got home that night, battered but carrying her world championship belt, she woke her parents. “My dad jumped out of bed and started calling his friends,” she laughs. “That morning I’d been unwell and he didn’t speak to me. I wanted his blessing but he tried to pretend he didn’t know about the fight. I asked my mum for her blessing. She prayed and gave me a big hug. But when I got home around midnight my dad was so happy and proud.”Her parents surprised her when they did not resist her decision to accept an offer from David Haye to switch to professional boxing in 2018. It has been difficult for Begum and she has only had two bouts as a pro boxer – both against Ivanka Ivanova. The first fight was a draw and then, in June 2019, she was hurt badly and lost a decision to her Bulgarian opponent.“She didn’t hurt me in the first fight and so I was shocked the second time. There was just something unusual about her that night. When I hit her there was no reaction. That freaks me out because I’ve sparred with some boys, and good pros, in Vegas. I’ve made their noses bleed and if I hit someone there’s always some reaction. But there was nothing like that in our second fight. She was like a zombie.“It didn’t help that she elbowed me in the first 30 seconds and my eye completely closed. I was fighting with just one eye and it was very hard to measure distance. Everyone wanted me to give up afterwards but I’ve followed my gut. It’s a learning curve and the only problem with boxing is that once you lose your unbeaten record it’s meant to be over. And it’s far harder being a female boxer because there are no journeywomen. Any woman that goes into boxing is a serious fighter because they wouldn’t get signed otherwise.”The Covid crisis has made it even more difficult but Begum is convinced she will become a world champion boxer. She is in talks with promoters in the US and says: “I’m hopeful. I feel like my story is bigger than boxing and these challenges will make me a better fighter and a better person. For me it’s nothing new. I’ve already gone through so many challenges in a different sport and in my life.”Begum stands up and curls one of her fighting hands into a fist. The world outside is reeling and we have our masks at the ready before we leave the gym. But it feels right that this born fighter should stretch out her hand and bump her fist lightly against mine. “Phew, it was emotional,” she says simply as she reflects on the story of her life, “but it was good.”Born Fighter by Ruqsana Begum is published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fedf9dcf71384a9d5af7402eb9d3dd8b5fce07e/0_2_2433_1460/master/2433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebce675479efaf8a8a78f341bb4c6789","title":"uk sports minister says rugby union outside elite may have to scrap scrums","story":"The sports minister Nigel Huddleston has indicated that there will have to be changes to the way recreational rugby union is played before it is allowed to return, including potentially no scrummages until after Christmas.Community rugby remains on the second stage of a six-part roadmap for a phased return, with players allowed to exercise within a small group of six players provided they maintain social distancing. However, no face-to-face contact is permitted and equipment sharing must be kept to a minimum.The RFU, which has submitted detailed proposals for community rugby to the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said earlier this month that it was hoping “to have some positive news soon about the potential move to the next stage”. The game’s governing body in England has also been targeting a return to full-contact rugby for grassroots clubs by the end of the year.However, Huddleston was more cautious when asked whether recreational rugby would be back next season. “I hope so but where you’ve got full contact, there are some sports – judo, karate, other full contact sports – where there’s particular challenges,” he said. “I think inevitably there are going to be some changes. It could be broadly recognisable, but the reality is, for a temporary period of time, we’re going to have to probably see some changes.”In May, World Rugby said that doing away with reset scrums and eliminating “upright face-to-face” tackles would significantly reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. The global body also advised making a change of jerseys and headgear at half-time compulsory, banning huddles on the pitch and outlawing spitting.When it was suggested to Huddleston that there might be no scrums in recreational rugby until after Christmas, he replied: “Potentially, but we’ll have to see. It will be based on medical and other advice.”All sports governing bodies have had to submit plans for a safe return to the DCMS as well as Public Health England for approval and Huddleston said he had been impressed by the level of responsibility and awareness across the industry.“Nobody’s trying to come in with something to try and get away with something that they know is transparently not going to work,” he added. “But I think there’s a recognition that we might have to see a few changes with the full-contact issues, or where there’s that risk of respiratory challenges.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e17ef668bec93af4ef4377eb067f319acc798082/0_465_3707_2224/master/3707.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=43509f7bdd0de6299debcd98e2eb33bf","title":"theatre reopening oliver dowden","story":"Culture secretary says he ‘does not want to give false hope’ to ailing industry, with timescale not expected before NovemberThe culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, says it is likely to be November “at the earliest” before theatres are given a target date for reopening without social distancing.The news will cause further anguish in the UK’s beleaguered theatre industry, which has been calling for a clearer timescale for stage five of Dowden’s roadmap to reopen performance venues: permitting indoor theatres to reopen with a fuller audience. Outdoor performances with social distancing are currently allowed across England, with indoor productions for limited audience numbers permitted from next month.Talking to Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday, Dowden said he “can’t give a stronger commitment” than Boris Johnson’s recent suggestion that “when we get to November we will look again at social distancing and where we are with the spread of the virus”. The risk of coronavirus remains high, said Dowden, who added: “I don’t want to give people false hope.”With the government’s job retention scheme set to end on 31 October, theatres now face a period of increased risk during winter, which will be made worse if they are unable to have time to stage profitable pantomimes. In an article for the Evening Standard, Cameron Mackintosh wrote that “the possibility of a proper panto at Christmas is almost certainly ‘behind you’” if theatres don’t get the go ahead until November to reopen fully.Last week, introducing his London Palladium pilot experiment for reopening theatres, the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber had a message for Johnson: “Give us a date, mate!” Lloyd Webber predicted that regional theatre would be devastated without the box-office boost of a pantomime this Christmas and said that the producer Michael Harrison, co-owner of Qdos Pantomimes, which runs productions around the UK, “cannot proceed” with this year’s season if a reopening date was not announced by 1 August.Theatres around the UK continue to announce redundancy consultations, with Bristol Old Vic now anticipating that more than a third of its 60 full-time jobs could be at risk. Dowden gave details from the first funding round of the government’s £1.57bn emergency arts package on Wednesday. It will see a total of £622m distributed, with £500m delivered via Arts Council England to museums, galleries, theatres, music and comedy organisations £30m in grants via the British Film Institute to independent cinemas and £92m via the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Historic England to heritage sites."},{"url":null,"title":"you cant just accept it the sporty 80 year old who wont take bladder weakness lying down","story":"As a busy magazine editor, remembering to do pelvic floor exercises wasn’t always the first thing on Wendy James’s mind. Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

But 27 residents of the south Texas community had died from the virus that day, 22 the day before, and 35 the day before that.“I’ve never seen that ever in my life,” recalled John M Kreidler, a local funeral director, whose family has run Kreidler Funeral Home in McAllen for over a century.Hand-sanitizing machines and big bins with masks and gloves surround shoppers at the regional grocery store. Outside of Nomad Shrine Club, a rundown event space turned drive-thru pop-up, residents join a long line of people in cars in search of a Covid-19 test with rapid results. Even Tex Mex, a gentlemen’s club, has a somber message for patrons: “Clothed Again.”“The Rio Grande Valley has become the hotspot of a hotspot of a hotspot,” said Ivan Melendez, Hidalgo county’s health authority and a practicing clinician. “We’re at the epicenter of the coronavirus in the United States.”Melendez recalled recently encountering a critically ill patient with an alarmingly low pulse. He tried to warn someone, but nurses informed him that a different doctor had already decided not to intervene because theyIn the United States, where the prevailing mantra for physicians is “do no harm”, that kind of ruthless calculation strikes deep, especially when so many of the lives at stake are medically vulnerable and easily exploited.In Hidalgo county – “a poor, fat, diabetic population”, Melendez said bluntly – nearly one in three people under age 65 lack health insurance. Thirty percent live in poverty, and a 2020 WalletHub report found that three local cities hold the distinction as the “fattest” metropolitan area in the nation.Hidalgo county also sits along the US-Mexico border, and an estimated 102,000 unauthorized immigrants who may be afraid to seek care exist within its margins. Large families serve as an ideal vector for the virus, as do those who still flock to beaches and flea markets on weekends.Already, 467 members of the community have died from Covid-19, according to the county, most of them since Texas reopened in May. But the state government has actively thwarted efforts to go back into lockdown, prioritizing economic vitality even as the death toll skyrockets.Leonardo Tremari worries about going to his job inside a Walmart supercenter in McAllen, but he – and countless other employees – still have to work. “I don’t have a choice,” he told the , laughing tensely.Last week, Hidalgo county judge Richard F Cortez ordered residents to stay home and encouraged non-essential businesses to limit their services. But a spokesperson for Texas governor Greg Abbott quickly undermined Cortez’s authority, saying it was “simply a recommendation”. The dizzying policy ping-pong is an extension of a larger politicization of the pandemic nationwide during an election year, where just suggesting wearing a face mask has become a partisan dog whistle.Some people in Hidalgo county remain convinced that the current health crisis is made up or overblown, despite the fact that by now, everyone is at most a few degrees of separation from someone who has suffered or died because of Covid-19, Melendez said. More than 15,000 people have tested positive in the county, and last week, hospitals teemed with over a thousand patients stricken by the virus.In a matter of weeks, Melendez has put his sixth-grade teacher on life support, opened up a body bag to play a son’s farewell video for a patient who had already died, and stumbled upon a gravely ill nurse he’d known for 30 years, whom he didn’t even recognize at first glance. Harrowing personal moments abound, as do thorny gray areas.“There’s a moral, ethical dilemma at every place that we turn,” he said.Hospital emergency departments are struggling to cope, so other wings have morphed into Covid units – even when they aren’t equipped to do so. One health care worker at DHR Health in Edinburg, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described patients in hallways, two people to a room and “everything askew at all times” in a rehabilitation facility that has been converted amid the health emergency. The building isn’t made to provide so much life-sustaining oxygen, they said, and one time, it simply shut off.“Everybody here who is a healthcare professional feels very powerless,” they said. “We’re just trying to help do what we can with the horrible resources we’ve been given.”But anxious locals seek out diagnoses anyway. At Nomad Shrine Club, where results take minutes instead of days, members of the public arrive as early as 2 or 3am just to nab one of 300 daily tickets available for a test. A few blocks down the road, another, competing tent operation fielded so much demand that it rented out a larger parking lot.Both testing services charge fees, either $75 or $125. Neither takes insurance.Most patients just say they’re feeling down, said Genesis Gonzalez, a medical assistant who works at the tent. “Next thing you know, they come back positive.”As Gonzalez baked under the Texas sun, she wore short-sleeved scrubs and a mask, her hair tied back neatly. She and her colleagues have access to more comprehensive protective gear, she said, but some of them get dizzy or faint if they wear it in 101-degree weather.“I tell ’em, you know, ‘I have no idea what your loss feels like, and I’m so incredibly sorry for that loss,’” Garza said. “But I’m proud of them for coming themselves to get tested so that they won’t go out and expose other people. That’s really hard to do.”At Kreidler’s funeral home, corpses wrapped in sheets, then double-bagged and wrapped again lay across tables in the preparation room because there’s no space left in the cooler. The crematory is fully booked up to 10 days in advance.Kreidler and his staff, including his wife and son, sometimes work into the night without much sleep or regular meals. They’re constantly in a rush, and every time a body leaves, it just means another spot has opened up.“We’re wanting the pandemic to go away,” said the weary funeral director, who’s fed up with how the crisis has been manipulated as a “political football”.“We need to get this stopped – and stopped now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c61538eaf345c2efcaad60fc686a2dd5ce31c6fb/149_0_2512_1508/master/2512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7acaa15548ded4608f4e95676f377ece","title":"coronavirus near me are uk covid 19 cases rising in your area latest updates","story":"Latest updates: how has Covid-19 progressed where you live? Check the week-on-week changes across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern IrelandThe map shows local authorities where the number of cases has increased week-on-week and where it has fallen. Some of this is due to natural fluctuations, especially in areas where there are very few cases, and so a rise from 1 to 2 is a doubling. Increased testing also means that more cases may be being detected than previously, although the impact of this between one week and the next is likely to be slight.But even in Kent, a large and populous county with relatively many cases, a rise week-on-week may still be consistent with a downward trajectory overall, if outweighed by falls in the weeks before and after. It does, however, suggest the value of continued vigilance.The chart below shows the areas that have had the highest daily peaks of new Covid-19 cases. Despite a first peak at the start of April, notably in Birmingham and Sheffield, cases in all areas were falling in May.Other areas have had less dramatic peaks of infection. Find the cases curve in your own area by typing into the search bar below.The numbers of cases only include those who have been tested for Covid-19. The actual number of cases is likely to be much higher as many people with symptoms have not been tested. Cases data for England comes from Public Health England and includes only tests carried out by public health bodies. This is known as “pillar 1” testing.At time of publication, approximately a third of positive tests were carried by commercial testers, so-called “pillar 2” testing. While these commercial test results are included in the UK-wide figure, data about these tests is not available at a regional or local level in England. Public health bodies for other UK nations follow different approaches so comparisons between areas in different parts of the UK may be problematic.

Wealthy countries are able to take a gamble, signing deals for vaccines that may not work.The latest contract signed by the UK is with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and its French partner, Sanofi Pasteur, for 60m doses of the Covid-19 vaccine they are developing. It already has deals for 100m doses of the Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca vaccine and for 90m doses of two others.The hope is that the UK could begin to vaccinate priority groups, such as frontline health and social care workers and those at increased risk from coronavirus, as early as the first half of next year, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said.Human clinical studies of the GSKSanofi vaccine will begin in September followed by a phase 3 study in December. The vaccine is not as far ahead in the development porcess as that being worked on at Oxford University, which is already in large-scale human trials in Brazil and the US, where there are many more infections than in Europe.The Covid-19 vaccines in development fall into roughly four different groups, according to the technologies on which they are based. The government strategy is to buy several vaccines from each group, Kate Bingham, the chair of the government’s vaccine taskforce, has said.The government accepts it could lose money on some. If all of them work, “we will be the vaccine supplier to the world”, she said, “but the likelihood is most of these will fail”. The intention was to buy up to 12 vaccines.The US is intent on ensuring access for its citizens to the first available vaccines and its “America-first” policy will prohibit US companies from supplying them elsewhere in the world until its needs are met. There were promising trial results recently from Moderna, a biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which has begun large-scale phase 3 vaccine trials.The EU is working as a bloc to buy vaccines that are not produced in the US. The commission has secured a deal with AstraZeneca for 400m doses of the Oxford vaccine and is looking to invest in at least five others.The UK business secretary, Alok Sharma, said: “Our scientists and researchers are racing to find a safe and effective vaccine at a speed and scale never seen before. While this progress is truly remarkable, the fact remains that there are no guarantees.“In the meantime, it is important that we secure early access to a erse range of promising vaccine candidates, like GSK and Sanofi, to increase our chances of finding one that works so we can protect the public and save lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7593d0557c2c4c9f49734d290c078be7046979a/0_24_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8c1caca36a693c3a60a431a447de50d6","title":"global report downsized hajj pilgrimage begins amid covid 19 restrictions","story":"US deaths near 150,000 half of people living in Mumbai slums have had the coronavirus China records 100 new casesMuslim pilgrims have begun the annual hajj in the holy city of Mecca in a dramatically downsized version as the hosts, Saudi Arabia, try to prevent any outbreaks of coronavirus during the five-day pilgrimage.The hajj, one of the five pillars or most important practices of Islam and an obligation for able-bodied Muslims at least once in their lifetime, is usually one of the world’s largest religious gatherings as around 2.5 million people descend on the city from all over the world.But this year attendance is being limited to 10,000 people already residing in the kingdom as the authorities seek to control Covid-19. The disease has already infected more than 270,000 people in Saudi Arabia, placing it in the top 20 worst-affected countries.Pilgrims will be required to wear masks and observe social distancing during a series of religious rites that are completed over five days in Mecca and its surroundings in western Saudi Arabia.Those selected to take part in the hajj were subject to temperature checks and placed in quarantine as they began trickling into Mecca at the weekend.State media showed health workers sanitising their luggage, and some pilgrims reported being given electronic wristbands to allow authorities to monitor their whereabouts.There have now been 16.67 million cases of coronavirus around the world and more than 659,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

The doctor also reportedly claimed that alien DNA is used in medical treatments and some gynaecological problems are caused by people dreaming about having sex with demons.Florida, the third most populous state in the US, has reported another record one-day rise in coronavirus deaths. The state health department said 191 people died from the disease in the 24 hours to Tuesday evening.Cases in Texas passed the 400,000 mark, fuelling fears that the United States is still not taking control of the outbreak and adding pressure on Congress to pass another massive economic aid package.China reported 101 new coronavirus cases in the mainland for 28 July, the highest in over three and a half months, the health commission said on Wednesday. China has moved quickly to stem outbreaks by contact tracing and reimposing restrictions in affected areas. Recently many of the new infections are reported to have come from the far western region of Xinjiang, where 89 have been tallied for 28 July. One was recorded in Beijing, while three were imported cases, according to a statement by the National Health Commission.In Australia, the state of Victoria recorded 295 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, down 89 from Tuesday’s figure of 384, which in turn was 150 fewer than were recorded in the record high numbers on Monday. Nine more people have died, which is close to the national record 10 deaths reported in the state one day last week. There were 19 new cases in New South Wales state, prompting neighbouring Queensland to close its border to anyone from Sydney.New Zealand recorded two new cases of Covid-19, both diagnosed in returning travellers to the country who are quarantined in managed isolation facilities. That is the case for all of New Zealand’s 23 active cases of the coronavirus – there is no known community transmission.

What we all need to get our heads around is this is a new virus and this one is behaving differently,” Harris told a virtual briefing in Geneva, urging vigilance in applying measures to slow transmission that appears to be accelerated by mass gatherings.She also warned against thinking in terms of virus waves, saying: “It’s going to be one big wave. It’s going to go up and down a bit. The best thing is to flatten it and turn it into just something lapping at your feet.”The reality is that the issue of second waves has been a contentious one, much talked about by politicians – including Boris Johnson – and the media, but often very ill-defined.With no agreed-upon scientific definition, the term “second wave” has been used to mean anything from localised spikes in infection to full-blown national crises, leading some experts to avoid it.Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control, is among those arguing that the concept is unhelpful for “implying that Covid-19 will act as the flu acts”.Complicating the issue is perspective. Seen from a global viewpoint – such as that of the WHO – the pandemic appears as a single, large and still-accelerating outbreak, with worldwide numbers doubling in the past six weeks.In terms of regional spread and even within inidual countries, from a ground-level view, it becomes more complicated.What can appear like a second wave is sometimes different areas of the same country simply being out of phase with each other in experiencing the epidemic, as in the US where a strong but uneven first wave moved initially in fits and starts and then more quickly.Keith Neal, emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said that it has become a “media term”, as well as a scientific one.As Melissa Hawkins, a professor of health at American University, wrote in the Conversation, looking at the US situation, talking about second waves in countries where the disease has simply progressed unevenly is inappropriate.“The US as a whole is not in a second wave because the first wave never really stopped. The virus is simply spreading into new populations or resurging in places that let down their guard too soon,” she wrote, a comment applicable to other countries that have seen resurgences.As the University of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, which examined 10 epidemics of respiratory disease from 1889, points out: “Most of our thinking on second-wave theory arises from the 1918-20 Spanish flu that infected 500 million people worldwide and reportedly killed an estimated 20 million to 50 million.”“‘Waves’ imply a lack of viral circulation which is probably an illusion,” wrote Tom Jefferson and Carl Heneghan early in the outbreak in the UK.“Waves are also visible and mostly rhythmical. There does not appear to be any pattern or rhythm to the epidemics summarised in the table and their comings and going are only visible because of the effects on the human body and their impact on society.”The disease has little respect for land borders, even when authorities have tried to seal them perhaps the only country that appears to have entirely stamped out the disease is New Zealand, an island nation that has curtailed almost all inbound travel.More important than the description of any rise in cases is public health management of the increase, Neal added, and he cautioned that identifying a true second wave may need the perspective of time.“The WHO is looking at world figures and these are still increasing so as a pandemic we are in the first wave.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5783571682f008ed5e337d8e863946e6593fd0eb/0_273_4655_2794/master/4655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f59b8004b862b4eedaa5b8f481df5e2c","title":"vietnam on high alert coronavirus cases major cities hanoi","story":"First local case in three months reported over the weekend in holiday spot of Da NangVietnam is on high alert and bracing for a big rise in coronavirus cases, after local media reported that infections have been detected in the capital, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and the Central Highlands region.The country’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phu warned on Wednesday that every province and every city was at risk, and that the virus appeared to have changed.Vietnam, which has been praised for its response to the pandemic, reported its first local case for more than three months last weekend, after a man in the central city of Da Nang became ill. Officials have said that at least one of the new infections involves a new strain of the virus that has originated outside of the country.So far, 30 cases of the virus have been detected in or around Da Nang, though new infections elsewhere in the country have not been confirmed by the ministry of health. There are growing fears that tens of thousands of people holidaying in the coastal city of Da Nang may have transported the virus across the country over recent weeks.“We have to act more swiftly and more fiercely in order to control the outbreak,” the state broadcaster VTV reported Phuc as telling a meeting of government officials. He said tourist hubs throughout the country should increase vigilance.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.The government is evacuating 80,000 people from Da Nang, mostly tourists who had been taking advantage of discounted travel deals, who will be required to isolate at home. The city has been placed under strict lockdown, with flights suspended.VTV reported that the cases in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City were linked to the cluster in Da Nang.Life in Vietnam had been returning to normal, with many people no longer wearing face masks and domestic tourism booming, but the country is again on high alert. In Hanoi, authorities are tracing people who may have had close contact with a man who works in a pizza restaurant and who is suspected of having Covid-19. Barriers have been placed near to the man’s home, while the restaurant and local area have been disinfected.In Ho Chi Minh City, a hotel has been locked down and a nearby hospital in Binh Tan district has stopped receiving patients for three days, after two suspected Covid-19 cases emerged.About 18,000 tourists who had been in Da Nang have returned to Ho Chi Minh City, officials said on Tuesday. Hanoi authorities had earlier said they were expecting 15,000 to 20,000 to return from the city.The country responded with speed and agility to the pandemic earlier this year, deploying aggressive contact-tracing systems and quarantine measures – avoiding a major outbreak. Despite sharing a border with China, Vietnam has recorded 446 Covid-19 cases, and no fatalities.The source of the new cases is not clear, though the government has responded with a series of arrests linked to illegal immigration. Vietnam remains shut to most foreign travellers, and anyone who enters the country must quarantine on arrival.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef01a54ac1101189ce2c450c3079454184094e40/0_0_5472_3588/master/5472.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c87c4062f23b2e3f6ecd4cf6475cf781 1320w","title":"coronavirus vaccine tracker how close are we to a vaccine","story":"More than 140 teams of researchers are racing to develop a safe and effective coronavirus vaccineResearchers around the world are racing to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, with more than 140 candidate vaccines now tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO).Vaccines normally require years of testing and additional time to produce at scale, but scientists are hoping to develop a coronavirus vaccine within 12 to 18 months.Vaccines mimic the virus – or part of the virus – they protect against, stimulating the immune system to develop antibodies. They must follow higher safety standards than other drugs because they are given to millions of healthy people.In the pre-clinical stage of testing, researchers give the vaccine to animals to see if it triggers an immune response. In phase 1 of clinical testing, the vaccine is given to a small group of people to determine whether it is safe and to learn more about the immune response it provokes. In phase 2, the vaccine is given to hundreds of people so scientists can learn more about its safety and correct dosage. In phase 3, the vaccine is given to thousands of people to confirm its safety – including rare side effects – and effectiveness. These trials involve a control group which is given a placebo.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe Dublin City Council is investigating the decision by the Shelbourne Hotel to remove four statues from its facade, apparently without planning permission. The statues of two Nubian princesses and two slave girls were removed by the hotel on Monday. Hotel management said they took the decision in light of world events and the black lives matter movement which has called attention to the legacy of slavery around the world. In a statement Dublin City Council said it was “not aware of permission being granted to remove the statues concerned. “The matter is under investigation by the planning enforcement section and therefore no further comment can be made on the matter at this time.” The Irish Georgian Society said it had lodged a complaint with the council about the removal of the statues. It tweeted on Tuesday night: “Further to reports and in the interests of clarity, the IGS was not consulted about the removal of statues from The Shelbourne Hotel. “Such works require planning permission which we believe was not sought. The IGS has contacted DCC planning urging them to address the matter.” Dublin City Councillor Deirdre Conroy said the removal of the statues was a breach of Part Four of the Planning Development Act 2000. Cllr Conroy, who is an architect and a conservationist, has written to the planning executive and the conservation officer in the council about the removal. She said the facade of the Shelbourne Hotel including its statues are a listed structure and therefore cannot be amended without permission from the council. She said many householders are being refused planning permission to remove railings from outside their homes. “Dublin City Council would not allow a 19th century pedestrian gate to be changed. The idea that the Shelbourne Hotel on St Stephen’s Green would be allowed to do that is just ridiculous really,” she said. Cllr Conroy said under Section 57 (2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 the owner of a protected structure such as the facade of the Shelbourne Hotel has to make a written request to the planning authority for an exemption application. “It would take three months at least for the conservation application department to make an assessment of a Section 57 application.” Green Party MEP Ciaran Cuffe, who is also an architect, said a period of public consultation should have taken place before such a “significant step” was taken.

Photograph: Wikimedia Commins The Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin has taken down four statues which have stood outside it for the last 153 years because of their associations with slavery.The four bronze statues were commissioned by the Shelbourne Hotel’s owner in 1867 when the celebrated facade was erected.They depict two Nubian princesses from the lower Nile and their slave girls holding torches.Nubia was for a long time a rival kingdom to Ancient Egypt before it was conquered by the Egyptians and its art was an important influence in the 19th century.The princess statues had hieroglyphics down the front of them.The statues were cast in bronze and commissioned from the studios of MM Barbezat of Paris.The Shelbourne Hotel, which has been situated on St Stephen’s Green since 1824, removed them on Monday in line with the decision by other bodies and local authorities to remove statues relating to the slave trade.The hotel’s general manager JP Kavanagh said the decision to take the four statues down had been taken by them alone and there had been no complaints from outsiders about them.“It was a decision taken just by us with our owner and operator. This decision has been coming for a number of weeks given what has been happening in the world,” he said.“When we restored the facade in 2015 and 2016, we consulted with Irish Heritage and the Irish Georgian Society.“What comes next I don’t know at this stage, but we will work with the relevant authorities.”Mr Kavanagh said there was a possibility that some or all of the statues might be restored to their old plinths but “right now” that is not an option and they hoped to work with Irish Heritage to replace them. “We will share further information in due course,” he added.The five-star hotel underwent a €40 million renovation programme between 2005 and 2007 and was closed for 18 months. It celebrated 195 years in business last year.It was acquired by the global real estate company Kennedy Wilson in 2014 and two year later it completed a significant refurbishment of the exterior facade that later won the Irish Georgian Society’s top award. However, there was no attempt to remove the statues at that stage.However the Irish Georgian Society on Tuesday raised the question about the need for planning permission to remove the statues. It said “in the interests of clarity, the IGS was not consulted about the removal of statues from The Shelbourne Hotel”.Green Party MEP for Dublin Ciaran Cuffe called for a period of public consultation about the statues.

Photograph: PALegislation to put the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) on a statutory footing and provide PRSI credits to recipients of the €350 emergency payment was passed by the Dáil last night despite intense Opposition criticism.The new law also provides that those on the pandemic payment must be actively seeking work but TDs said many of these people were waiting for their workplaces to-reopen and thousands of artists and those in the entertainment sector were being forced not to work because of the public health guidelines on the pandemic.People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett claimed the legislation was “an attempt to whip people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own as a result of public health advice into low-paid employment in other jobs”. That is what the Government is doing. He said the Government “is giving itself the legal right to put pressure on people who work in the arts, in live entertainment and music to go to work in a McDonald’s”. Opposition TDs also sharply condemned the Government’s stopping of PUP payments to those travelling overseas.But Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys insisted it was legal for her department to stop the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) to social welfare recipients travelling abroad.Restrictions She said in the Dáil that restrictions on payments to social welfare recipients when they travel overseas are part of primary legislation dating back to 2005.As controversy intensified amid accusations that such cuts were “blatantly discriminatory” Ms Humphreys said “it is set down in legislation that you don’t get payment if outside the country but we have historically applied flexibility to allow two weeks foreign travel”.“The PUP is only payable to people who are living in the State and it was never paid to people who travel abroad,” she said. “The flexibility which applied to other social welfare payments never applied to PUP.”Confirming during debate on the Covid-19 (Amendment) Bill that 2,500 PUP payments had been stopped since March - 2,000 at Dublin airport - from people travelling abroad, Ms Humphreys said this has saved the taxpayer €20.5 million that would have been paid to people not entitled to the benefit because they were leaving the country permanently.“There is legislative provision preventing its continued payment outside the State,” she said adding that because of the global pandemic and to support the continued adoption of the public health advice, “the department has temporarily suspended the flexibility which applies to jobseeker’s allowance and benefit”.Ms Humphreys pointed out that the pandemic payment was introduced when the country was in lockdown and nobody could travel more than 2 km.‘Firm legal basis’She said airport checks by social welfare inspectors “have a firm legal basis” in place since 2012. No information is shared between airports and the department. Its own inspectors or gardaí seconded to social protection “speak to relevant iniduals”.Ms Humphreys said anyone who felt they were treated wrongly can request a review and there was an appeal system in place.Sinn Féin TD Aengus Ó Snodaigh criticised the requirement for PUP recipients to be actively seeking work. He said “riggers, stagehands, dancers, security, ticket office staff, lighting, sound and many others” in the arts sector had already had the payment cut or reduced.But he said one such person had told him in a letter that “I am not unemployed. I am forced not to be employed as a direct result of Government guidelines”.Mr Ó Snodaigh said that if everyone should actively be seeking work the Minster should “tell the employers of all of these people that they need to issue P45s and redundancy payments”.Labour spokesman Sean Sherlock questioned the legality of airport checks and said many people who travelled overseas had not been made aware that travel was not permitted.He criticised cuts in the payment to those in the events industry “made up of hundreds of small businesses and sole traders who, although normally profitable, are depending on the Covid payments many having sunk savings and personal assets into their enterprises”.The Bill now goes to the Seanad."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316073.1595964623!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit checks may deter firms like tesco from trading in northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316564.1596024395!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pup u turn government changes mind and says people on pandemic payments can travel","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin says that the Government is committed to helping and supporting people after it was announced that anyone travelling to green list countries can still receive the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.

Photograph: Collins Recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) who travel to green list countries will still receive the payment Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys has told the Dáil.Ms Humphreys admitted her department could have communicated more effectively and said that the cases of all those who travelled abroad for holidays would be reviewed.In a statement during Dáil question time she told TDs she had asked “people who wish to travel on any of the countries on the green list can do so and continue to receive their payment”.But she said people who travel to the countries not on the green list can only do so for “essential reasons”.She pointed out that of the 2,500 people whose payments have been stopped, 90 per cent were leaving the country permanently.However, later in the Dáil Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald appeared unaware of Ms Humphreys’s statement.Ms McDonald said that if the Government was going to penalise people for travelling abroad then it should be a punishment that was universal and not just for people on social welfare.She said “it seems to me that you acted outside the law”.Mr Martin said the Sinn Féin leader “loves throwing accusation” as he defended the Government’s approach to the pandemic payment.Rise TD Paul Murphy said the situation was “a shambles”. He referred to the statement by Ms Humphreys and said it appeared to be “at least a partial U-turn on the policy and leaves PUP recipients wondering has the discrimination being ended” and if that money would be reinstated.But the Taoiseach had just spent five minutes “speechifying” about everything other than the payment. “Can you please provide clarity” he asked Mr Martin.The Taoiseach said “the assertion of shambles is wrong”. Mr Martin said he was not responsible for operational decisions and that people on the ground had responsibility for social protection. The Taoiseach added he had said there should be a review of cases of people whose payments had been cut.Controversy erupted after it emerged at the weekend that recipients of the €350 emergency payment were having the benefit docked for overseas travel.The payment was introduced when the country was in lockdown, and Ms Humphreys said it was Government policy to restrict travel outside the country because of the pandemic.The Minister said her officials would review cases where people had had their payment stopped.The Government has been sharply criticised by the Opposition and accused of punishing people who had lost their jobs by cutting their payment.Last night, the Dáil passed legislation putting the PUP payment on a statutory basis and extending it to the end of March at a cost of €2.2 billion.In the Dáil on Wednesday the Taoiseach aid the PUP payment was a sign of the Government’s solidarity with the people as he accused the Sinn Féin leader of “play acting”.Ms McDonald had criticised the cutting of the payment from people if they travelled abroad."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Najib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area.

That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet.

Holding an annual mass gathering of fasting and prayer from February 17 to 21 many branded the supercluster that turned Mulhouse into France’s Covid ground zero and the country into one of the world’s worst hit.For five days, around 2,200 people from around mainland and overseas France, neighbouring Switzerland and Germany and even Burkina Faso sang gospel and clasped hands.“We’re going to celebrate the Lord! Are you feeling the joy tonight?,” the charismatic pastor asked as they prayed for a miracle cure from ailments. Little did he know that the coronavirus had also entered the building and that almost his entire flock would be infected, 80 hospitalised and 31 die from the disease.When followers returned home, they unleashed what one top health official called a “viral nuclear bomb” whose fallout was felt around France.The health minister called it France’s “flipping point”. Its scientific council said without it, the country would be on a par with Germany - only 15 minutes away for 45,000 cross-border commuters but which suffered a third as many deaths.Twisting the knife, the state prefect of the Grand Est region, Josiane Chevalier, accused the church of failing to respect basic “social distancing measures: in short, everything you shouldn’t do”.The claims triggered torrents of hate mail. One of hundreds of messages read: “Thanks again for the French pandemic. We know who you are”.“The main culprit should have died so that this sect could answer for all the evil it has inflicted on Mulhouse!,” read another.Joining his hands, Mr Peterschmitt said: “We have received calls on social media to ‘gun him down with a Kalashnikov’ or ‘burn the church’. A colleague even received death threats at work.”Returning to the four corners of France, believers who fell ill said they were ostracised.Antoinette, a 70-year-old grandmother who lives on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, said she could not be fully identified as believers had been stigmatised by people outside the church for spreading the virus.“People have pointed their finger at me. They need a scapegoat, she said.Indeed, there is mounting evidence that the disease was already spreading relentlessly in the region before the gathering and that French health authorities had failed to pick up far earlier warning signs of impending disaster.President Emmanuel Macron gave a speech barely 200 yards from the church that very week. “He was shaking hands and taking selfies for an hour and a half,” said local shopkeeper Simsek Meleki, 40. \u0027Now people joke that Macron brought the virus with him.”Mr Peterschmitt asked: “How do expect us to know there was a risk if the President of France wasn’t aware of it?Two recent studies, one on chest X-rays in nearby Colmar, another quizzing 3,300 locals, suggest that that the first cases date back to November and that the epidemic had already taken off by mid-February in the area.Laurent Gerbaud, an epidemiologist at Clermont-Ferrand university hospital, said the findings suggested health authorities had failed to detect early warning signals.  “We have a woefully centralised bureaucracy incapable of receiving information from the ground up,” he said.All that said, there was little doubt, he added, that the church gathering turbo-charged contamination in France.Nobody felt ill during the event, but the following week, the pastor came down with flu-like symptoms and by Sunday, at least 800 people didn’t show up to church.On March 2, his son Jonathan tested positive and warned local health authorities about the gathering. That very same day, the first Covid patient was admitted to intensive care in Mulhouse’s Emile-Muller hospital.Joy Mootien, 54, chief consultant at the hospital’s medical intensive care unit remembered his patient zero well.“He was lying in his bed with breathing difficulties. When I saw the chest X-ray, I instinctively grabbed my mask,” he recalled. His family said he had not travelled recently but his wife did mention a large church gathering.“When I heard how big it was, I knew we were in trouble.”That night, Patrick Vogt, 64, a doctor fielding emergency calls in Mulhouse, witnessed the tidal wave.“More than 1,000 people rang in with such symptoms. It was frightening. We weren’t prepared here or in France,” he said. Despite the flood, state authorities calmly announced just six cases in the region the following day.“There was a chasm between what we were seeing on the ground and the official claims the virus was contained,” said Mr Vogt. “We lost two weeks pinpointing the church cluster,” he claimed.On March 5, gasping for air, Mr Peterschmitt was hospitalised. “I felt like a candle in the wind and thought my final hour had come. I was quite calm,” he said. Some 18 members of his family were struck down.That evening, Jean Rottner, 53, a casualty doctor and president of France’s Grand Est region sent a text message to President Emmanuel Macron.“I told him: ‘Watch out, what is happening here is not in line with the discourse we’re hearing in France. Please understand we’re in the midst of an epidemic.” In two days, the number of local cases multiplied by eight.French pride in its globally lauded public health took a huge knock when it realised that Germany was coping far better. Mr Rottner said this was partly down to mass testing, better communication between GPs and hospitals and far more intensive care beds - some 20,000 to France’s 5,000 at the start of the crisis.“But also we had this very particular cluster in Mulhouse which led to a brutal viral explosion. Germany didn’t have to deal with a problem of that magnitude.”At the hospital, very quickly all ICUs were full.“We were not on the front line, we were the front line,” said Marc Noizet, head of A\u0026ampE and emergency services.As critical patients kept arriving, soldiers were dispatched to construct a field hospital in the hospital car park with another 30 beds.Patients were ferried by helicopter to surrounding hospitals, then by plane and specially medicalised TGV fast trains to less affected regions of France. Others were sent to neighbouring Switzerland, Germany, as well as Luxemburg and Austria, whose hospitals were never underwater.In town, taxi driver Salah Aitabbes, 55, recalled: “It was like a science fiction movie with helicopters coming and going, the wail of ambulance sirens, empty streets and hearses.”A few hundred yards from the Open Door Church, Brigitte Ritz’s undertaker business was overwhelmed.“When you work with death, you tame your fear but this was different,” she said, arranging plastic flowers.“The funerary centre had coffins piled up with the air conditioning on full blast. When that was full, they were put in a special refrigerated hangar,” she said.Four months later, the death toll in the Grand Est region’s hospitals from Covid-19 is 3,383 with 1,809 more deaths in nursing homes. France, meanwhile, has just surpassed the 30,000 deaths mark.Many who did pull through intensive care are still struggling to recover.Malika Fisli, an auxiliary nurse from Mulhouse, was plunged into an artificial coma mid-March and woke up in Brest, western France, two weeks later.Today, she has lung scarring that will take up to nine months to heal and requires daily physio to regain 16kg of lost muscle. “I get breathless and have palpitations,” she said.“I still don’t dare go into shops and get angry when I see groups of people without masks.”Mrs Fisli worked in a nursing home, many of which turned into silent death traps. On her floor alone, ten among 49 elderly residents died of the disease and half her colleagues fell ill.She suffers from flashbacks in which she runs towards a blinding light and can hear a man saying: “Unplug her”. “But doctor, she’s only 58 and has four children,” another, female, voice chimes in.It was no nightmare. “During the coma, I heard these things. Afterwards, I asked the nurse if it was true. She went pale and confirmed that it was. I owe her my life,” she said. “But I don’t blame the doctor, he was only doing his job.”Like Malika, Mulhouse - a town with a proud industrial past sometimes referred to as the “French Manchester” - is slowly healing.“We were, without doubt, France’s ground zero,” said Mr Rottner, the Grand Est president.“We all know people who died, families that were affected. We won’t forget that. But we know our challenge is to shed this image of a region that was seriously hit by this disease and show that we can recover.”Others said it was high time to turn the page.“I’m fed up with Mulhouse being singled out as a pestilential city,” said Jean-Claude, a train conductor. “The truth is that for most of us it wasn’t as catastrophic as all that and certainly no worse than in Paris,” he said.As locals return to cafes, bars and restaurants, French health officials are fretting about an uptick in infections with the “R number”, which reflects infection rates, now above one in most regions. But ironically, the only one today below that dangerous watermark is the Grand Est.Back in his empty church, Mr Peterschmitt checked hand gel and spacing between chairs that have quartered capacity to 600.After weeks of online worship from his living room, he was finally about to meet the faithful in the flesh for the first time since that fateful gathering.Still weakened from his illness, he said he was worried about the future.“We’re in a very sensitive area here. What if a madman passed by and shot followers during the next worship?,” he asked.“Human beings are predators for their own kind. All this proves I was right to be a pastor and evangelist. Rousseau said, \u0027man is good but society corrupts him\u0027. The bible says, \u0027the heart of man is bad and society is simply its reflection.\u0027”“We are guilty of nothing. We were a fire in a forest already burning.”Despite his fears, he said he was looking forward to reconnecting with his flock.“I will tell them two things: how happy I am to see them again and to take heart: we can’t keep looking in the rear mirror. Life goes on.’”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"google has given employees one thing crave certainty","story":"As ever in the 21st century, with regard to the direction Western societies take, major tech companies continue to lead the way. This week Google announced that employees would continue to work from home until July 2021, following similar announcements over remote working from Twitter and Facebook in recent months.It is a bold step for three of the largest beasts of Silicon Valley to take, given the amount of resources each has poured into their respective headquarters and other centres to attract the brightest and best from across the world to work for them. It represents a very real shift in the cultures of these companies, built on the idea of interconnectedness and human relationships, and how they will evolve. But then again, all three are also based on the core idea of being connected to other people anywhere in the world with a signal – this is perhaps the best opportunity since the invention of the internet to demonstrate the power and versatility of their respective products at source.The coronavirus disease has spooked people, making the sprawling campuses of Google et al., momentarily at least, far less viable. That is even more true of smaller companies previously straitjacketed by traditional office layouts. And, even if transmission is receding in some places, public confidence is at rock bottom and will probably remain so until a vaccine has been developed, mass produced, and been in circulation for a good few months. Until such a time, many employees, rightly or wrongly, simply won’t feel happy returning to work at places like Google — and companies like Google won’t feel particularly enamoured at the idea of risking becoming hotspots for infection spikes themselves. In the long term, no doubt, many of Google’s workers will come to realise that turning your home into the office isn’t the oasis of calm and convenience it appears now. Sure, not having to brave the outside world as a deadly virus abounds somewhere out in the wild may seem tempting, but the separation between work and life is an important distinction to maintain the internet is an intrusive thing. After a while, people may begin to resent that they are never able to leave the office behind, and that the reach of their boss now extends even further into their bedrooms, bathrooms and living rooms, previously a form of sanctuary.Furthermore, innovative, “creative” companies may also begin to the feel the limitations of curtailed human contact in the process of trying to charge forward. Brainstorming with colleagues around a ping pong table or on a semicircle of beanbags on a grassy lawn may seem naff to the average person, but surely it has to be an easier, more productive process than doing it from your bed with other people only half paying attention and refusing to make eye contact over Skype.But in the short term, in an age of uncertainty, Google’s decision gives its workers a time frame. The schedule of 12 months is what you might call “proper time” – enough to start making more permanent arrangements for everything from work set ups to child care to holidays and even moving house. It allows a semblance of normality to return, elongating the short term into something a lot less unstable than it currently feels like. It also allows the company itself to start making more permanent decisions – taking halted plans out of stasis and forging ahead. Office culture is something that we should not, necessarily, welcome. The so-called “new normal,” with its stresses and limitations, is not something we should ever embrace as normality. But making the abnormal more manageable is a positive step, and that is what Google is trying to do. Only time will tell if the seeds bare fruit, but it has to be better than not sowing anything at all.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must slim many nurses fat","story":"Shortly after reading Matt Hancock’s article about combatting obesity in yesterday’s paper, I emerged from a café to find my way virtually blocked by an enormously wide, youngish woman in a nurse’s uniform. It was a vivid reminder of a general fact about the National Health Service: many of its staff are fat.That matters, not only for the health of the NHS staff involved, but also for the effectiveness of any anti-obesity campaign. If the public are being urged to lose weight, they will not take the message seriously if they notice that a substantial proportion of those caring for them are not doing so. It reminds me of the days when lots of doctors still smoked.In his article, the Health Secretary also mentioned “stark inequalities in our nation’s health”. These are apparent within NHS staff. Sightings of fat NHS doctors are definitely unusual these days. Nurses and ancillary staff, on the other hand, are often disproportionately tubby.Why should this be? My guess is that the NHS, as a collectivity, is not a very health-conscious employer. What sort of food is served to hospital staff? Are they discouraged from eating too many American-style muffins? Certainly most hospital food for patients remains fattening and unappetising. Most hospital public coffee-shops groan under the weight of buns and fizzy drinks.The Government justifies an anti-obesity campaign partly in terms of the need to “help protect the health service”. As with its coronavirus slogan, this gets the problem back to front.Obviously, all citizens should behave well towards the public services. There is something even more disgusting, for example, about rioters who attack police and emergency services rather than just lamp-posts or one another. But the public do not exist to look after the NHS. The NHS exists to look after us.It will be an evil day if our defective lifestyle choices ever count against us when receiving medical treatment. When the AIDS epidemic began in the 1980s, one chief constable said that AIDS victims were “swirling around in a cesspool of their own making”. Even if this had been true, it would not have justified rationing or withholding their treatment. Motorcyclists and riders get more head injuries than the average. Drunks suffer from far more ailments than the sober.All of us, even the most virtuous, create work for the NHS simply by being alive, especially if we have the impertinence to get old. Don’t let’s go down the slippery slope of judging patients on their moral worth.The good reason for slimming is that you, and those dear to you, will usually have a happier and healthier life as a result. The message should be as simple as that.Last night’s BBC Panorama programme, China’s Coronavirus Cover-up, laid out the story efficiently. There can surely be no reasonable doubt that the Chinese Communist Party reacted slowly and mendaciously to the appearance of the virus. The results were literally fatal for thousands, arguably for hundreds of thousands all over the world. The programme brought this home.Two things, however, worried me. Both of them arose from the testimony of the programme’s star witness, Professor Kwok-Yung Yuen, who was part of the first delegation of external medical experts allowed to visit Wuhan.Professor Yuen spoke well and seemed wholly honourable, but it occurred to me that he might have fallen into a trap laid by the regime. He was told by the Wuhan authorities, he said, that the city’s wet market had been completely cleaned up before his arrival and that samples of only some of the animals there had been preserved. The implication, accepted by the programme, was that evidence of the disease’s origin had been erased.There is an alternative explanation. If it is true, as the scientists Angus Dalgleish and Birger Sorensen have posited in their learned paper on the subject (see this column, June 6) that the killer virus originated not in the market but in the Wuhan lab, then the reason for destroying much of the “evidence” from the wet market was not that the truth lay there, but that it did not. The Chinese wanted people to believe that the market contained something important, when actually it did not. You could put it thus: another creature from the animal kingdom, as well as bats and pangolins, had been available in the market – red herrings.My other doubt concerned Professor Yuen’s assertion that there had been “some cover-up locally”. I bet there was but surely the key point is that there was more than some cover-up nationally, at the highest level.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"belgium luxembourg among brace countries covid rates may lead","story":"Luxembourg and Belgium are at risk of having quarantine reimposed by the Government as their coronavirus rates rise, an analysis by The  suggests.As the Government finalises its weekly review of “air bridges” due on Friday, the analysis shows both Luxembourg and Belgium have seen week-on-week rises in the Covid-19 rates to post-lockdown peaks.At least four other countries have rising rates - with Croatia also on an unofficial watchlist following the travel chaos sparked when the Government reimposed quarantine on Spain at the weekend, upturning the holiday plans of up to 1.8m Britons.On Tuesday Boris Johnson warned of signs of a second wave of coronavirus in Europe, as he defended the 14-day quarantine on travellers from Spain.  Belgium has seen its weekly Covid-19 rate rise from 5.3 to 15.1 per 100,000 of the population since the beginning of July, with cases up from 615 to 1,751.The spike in infections has led to Belgium’s Government tightening social restrictions to contain the spread of coronavirus.Sophie Wilmes, the Belgian prime minister, said that from Wednesday a family or those living together can meet only the same five people from outside their household over the next four weeks. Antwerp has introduced a curfew.Luxembourg, which is bordered by Belgium to the north and west, has seen its weekly rates per 100,000 rise from 45.7 to 114.4, with the number of cases up from 286 to 716 in the same period. Use the interactive chart below to explore the infection rate across Europe.Other countries apparently at risk because of rising rates and post-lockdown peaks are the Bahamas, Monaco, Gibraltar and the Czech Republic. There is concern within the Government about Croatia, a major holiday destination for Britons, which is in the top 15 of the UK’s list of quarantine-free countries with its rate of 12.4 per 100,000. This is, however, down on the previous week’s.Mr Johnson said on Tuesday that the Government had to be swift in its response to spikes in coronavirus - and hinted at further action against other countries if necessary.Speaking during a visit to Nottinghamshire, the Prime Minister said: What we have to do is take swift and decisive action where we think that the risks are starting to bubble up again.Let\u0027s be absolutely clear about what\u0027s happening in Europe, amongst some of our European friends, I\u0027m afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic.It came as the UK reported a further 119 coronavirus deaths - taking the official number of deaths so far to 45,878 - but the daily figure is typically higher on Tuesdays due to delays in reporting deaths at the weekend.Dr Hans Kluge, the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) regional director for Europe, said there had been a “slight uptick” in new cases in the past couple of weeks in Europe as a result of an increasing number of countries experiencing localised outbreaks.He said this appeared to be driven by a higher proportion of new infections among young people who “don’t want to miss Summer” and were more likely to be mixing at parties, bars and clubs.“They have a responsibility to themselves, parents, grandparents and communities. We do know how important good health behaviours are. Let’s take advantage of that knowledge,” he said.It comes as Heathrow’s chief executive John Holland-Kaye has urged the Government to press ahead with airport tests of passengers for Covid-19 to help rescue summer and revive the economy.“We need to find a way of getting ‘red countries’ opened up again. Testing is the only viable way of doing that in the absence of a vaccine,” Mr Holland-Kaye told The Daily  in an exclusive interview.“A lot of countries which are red listed have millions of people who don’t have the disease and can’t travel.

It sounds almost reasonable – until you consider the case of Luxembourg, which remains on the FCO safe list.  The latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control show that the 14-day cumulative number of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 residents is 15 in the UK, 33.9 in Portugal, and 47.2 in Spain. And Luxembourg? 222.4. So why is Spain being picked on? Other countries with higher rates of infection than the UK include France (16), Croatia (27.1), and Belgium (29.1). It is far lower in Italy (5.1) and Greece (3.7).Covid-19 infections on the riseUnplanned moments are what makes holidays – and, indeed, life – worth living, writes Rob Crossan. I won’t embarrass the owner of the bed and breakfast where I stayed by naming them as they were clearly trying their best. But being told that I had a ‘strict 25-minute window’ to eat breakfast which I needed to ‘book in’ the night before hardly conspires to create a freewheeling, ‘all hands off deck’ vacation vibe.All the local pubs and restaurants, naturally, required a couple of phone calls and, in one case, a reassurance that I wasn’t ill, before I could get a table for a simple drink or meal. Day trips were also devoid of the impulse gene. My lifelong breezy assurances that ‘they’ll just let us in’, which have served me remarkably well over the years when it comes to gaining entry to everything from theme parks to National Trust properties no longer applies. These days, even just finding somewhere that’s open for business at all is a victory of sorts.Read the full story. A couple kiss as they cool off in a mist cloud generated by a public fountain in Bucharest, Romania. The country has just announced plans to make face mask mandatory in some outdoor settings. The CEO of EasyJet Holidays has joined calls for the UK government to overhaul its quarantine rules. After months of uncertainty as travel restrictions were lifted we saw encouraging signs of growing demand for holidays. Unfortunately the recent unstructured re-imposition of quarantine for Spain is creating renewed uncertainty and unpredictability for consumers.We encourage the Government to work collaboratively with the industry to deliver a more targeted and structured approach. We need targeted quarantine requirements for regions where spikes have occurred rather than applied at a national level. In the case of Spain its islands are hundreds of miles from the mainland and have very low infection rates with the Canaries, for example, as low as 2 per 100,000 in the past seven days which is significantly lower than the UK.We want to work with the government to find a way forward which can help customers plan their next break with confidence. The recent situation with Spain has again demonstrated how difficult it is for both the industry and holidaymakers to plan along with hotel and destinations partners needing to make challenging decisions about their businesses and employees where they so heavily rely on tourism. For these reasons I urge the government to have an open dialogue with the industry and quickly move to targeted and regional measures so that we can all stay safe and enjoy a much-deserved summer holiday.Hong Kong is on the verge of a large-scale coronavirus outbreak that could overwhelm hospitals, its leader warned today as authorities implemented their toughest social distancing measures yet.From July 29 all residents in the densely packed city of 7.5 million must wear masks when they leave their homes while restaurants can only serve takeaway meals.No more than two people from different households can gather in public with fines of up to HK$5,000 ($625) for those who breach the new emergency rules.Read the full story here and follow our coronavirus live blog for the latest updates.As we reported earlier this month, London has never been less crowded.

Previously only departures up to July 31 and August 9, respectively, had been scrapped.It has instead added additional flights from August 1-3 to popular destinations in Greece and Turkey, so Brits wishing to travel can still enjoy a summer holiday overseas.“The summer holiday period is the most important time of year for travel operators and we are therefore doing everything we can to help customers get their well-deserved holiday.  The health and safety of our customers and colleagues is always our highest priority and welcome travel advice that protects those that holiday with us and we have worked hard to provide safe and enjoyable holidays this summer.  “Importantly, we also call upon the UK Government to work closely with the travel industry and remove the ‘blunt tool’ approach to quarantine and consider the rapid introduction of regional Travel Corridors.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Scientists have discovered why coronavirus causes some patients to lose their sense of smell. Temporary loss of smell, or anosmia, is one of the earliest and most commonly reported warning signs of Covid-19. Studies suggest the “devastating” symptom better predicts the disease than other well-known symptoms such as a fever or cough. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the actual cause for loss of smell in Covid-19 patients has been unclear – until now. Researchers at Harvard Medical School in the United States have identified which cell types used for smelling are most vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

Their study instead found it attacks the cells supporting the olfactory sensory neurons. Dr Sandeep Robert Datta, associate professor of neurobiology at Harvard Medical School and co-author of the study, said this was a positive finding because it suggests most cases of Covid-19 are unlikely to cause a permanent loss of smell. He said: “Our findings indicate that the novel coronavirus changes the sense of smell in patients not by directly infecting neurons but by affecting the function of supporting cells. “I think it’s good news, because once the infection clears, olfactory neurons don’t appear to need to be replaced or rebuilt from scratch.” But, he added: “We need more data and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms to confirm this conclusion.” Created with Sketch.Rankin unveils portraits of NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Midwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolMidwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolThe majority of Covid-19 patients experience some level of anosmia, but most often it is temporary.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The farm at the centre of a horrific goat cruelty scandal revealed by The Independent may have to be shut down, its owner has said.Animals were secretly filmed being punched, kicked and slammed on their back at Far Marsh Farm, near Hull in East Yorkshire.Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Marks and Spencer all said they would immediately drop St Helen’s Farm dairy products – which are made using milk produced at Far Marsh – after being alerted to the brutality on Monday. On Tuesday, Ocado did likewise.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow, Angus Wielkopolski, founder of Yorkshire Dairy Goats which owns the farm, has told The Independent he is disgusted by what he saw in the video and says he is facing having to close the 4,000-animal site if he cannot salvage its reputation.Three out of its 10 staff have already been dismissed for gross misconduct while a fourth has been placed on an immediate final written warning. On Tuesday morning, just hours after the abuse was revealed, CCTV was being installed across the plant so its general manager – who says he was unaware of the abuse – could monitor animal treatment by workers.Goats punched, hit and ‘left lame’ at farm supplying supermarket milk“We are totally shocked and disgusted by what we have seen on that video,” Mr Wielkopolski said. “We are horrified. We had no idea this was going on. If we had known, we would have stopped it instantly. We have always made animal welfare a top priority…“It’s a big farm which runs 18 hours a day, seven days a week and the manager can’t supervise everything. We trusted our people. We cannot believe that they have done this. I have to believe it because I have seen the footage but if you had told me two days ago this was happening, I wouldn’t have believed it.”Asked what the revelation might do to business, the 65-year-old said: “I don’t want to speculate at the moment but whether the farm continues, we will have to see. You cannot run a dairy farm if you cannot sell the milk. It is not possible.”Mr Wielkopolski and wife Kathleen have run Yorkshire Dairy Goats and sister business A\u0026ampK Wielkopolski for 35 years. They own a second farm, also in East Yorkshire, with another 4,000 goats.He said milk produced across the two sites had helped popularise the product in a period when increasing numbers of people have sought alternatives to cow’s milk. But he added: “We have worked hard for 35 years and that could all get destroyed overnight.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it is obvious that the opposite is true at one of their supplying farms.”About an hour’s worth of video was passed to the group.In it, goats at Far Marsh – which is between the villages of Keyingham and Ottringham – were seen being kicked and punched, beaten with a pole, held by the throat and having their tails twisted.In one clip, goats were slammed onto their backs on a conveyor belt before their hooves were roughly trimmed. In another, an animal was seen being dragged by one leg along the ground while struggling.All of Britain’s leading supermarket chains said on Monday they would remove the St Helen’s Farm range from their shelves pending further investigation after being shown the footage by The Independent.But Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose were continuing to sell the brand’s milk, cheese and butter in three south London supermarkets visited by The Independent on Tuesday.Waitrose and Tesco both said they had stopped new orders of the products but would sell remaining stock already in stores.“We take animal welfare very seriously and have suspended all new orders from this company yesterday while we investigate. So what you see on our shelves will have been received before this date,” a Waitrose spokesperson said.A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s insisted “all products are being removed from sale”.St Helen’s Farm – which also uses goats milk from several other farms – has already ceased buying produce from Yorkshire Dairy Goats.Speaking after the initial revelations on Monday, a company spokesperson said: “Today we have been made aware of allegations that one farm has infringed animal welfare standards, which we would find totally unacceptable if true.“We have immediately ceased all milk supply from this farm and launched a full investigation to determine the facts of this matter.”The Animal Welfare Act 2006 states animals, including farm animals, must be protected from pain, injury, suffering and disease.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This process usually takes place in centres across the country run by firm Sopra Steria, which is contracted by the Home Office to deliver the service.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBefore the private company took over the contract last year, applicants could go to their local post office to provide biometric data such as fingerprints. Under Sopra Steria\u0027s service, they must attend one of six “core centres” across the country which offer a free service, or another 51 which usually charge a fee starting from £69.99.However, these centres were closed in March due to the lockdown, putting the process on hold. A phased re-opening of the centres began on 1 June, but nearly two months on, many applicants are still in limbo.People left without proof of UK status as visa centre fees soarAt the start of July, the Home Office informed applicants who had previously applied for UK visas that they would be put through a new process which would reuse biometrics they had submitted previously, and that therefore they could not book an appointment at one of the visa centres. But there has since been no update on when this new process will begin.Meanwhile, first-time applicants, who can still book appointments, have found that there are no free appointments being offered by Sopra Steria, despite the fact that all core centres are supposed to provide slots without charge. This has left some unable to afford to submit their biometrics, or having to travel long distances to do so.David Pountney, senior solicitor at Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit (GMIAU), told The Independent there would be hundreds, if not thousands, of people in this situation, many of whom would be at risk of falling foul to the hostile environment.“Without having that current, valid immigration document, people run into difficulties. People don’t have the documents and they don’t have anything else they can use to prove their right to be here,” he said.“Although in theory an employer or a landlord could contact the Home Office to check their immigration status, they’re not likely to, and even if they do the Home Office sometimes get it wrong.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Pountney said the lack of clarity around the new system of reusing biometrics was making it “impossible” to advise clients, adding: “Clients keep asking us when something is going to happen, and we just don’t know. We’ve got no clarity on who is likely to be covered by this new system or what the process is, so we have to play it by ear.”Andrew Tingley, partner and head of immigration at Womble Bond Dickinson (UK) LLP, said: “Thousand of applicants are currently in limbo as a result of the Home Office policy of allowing the re-use of biometrics. He argued that visa applicants should be given the choice on whether to opt into the new system of reusing biometrics.Filipino national Sharon Phillips, 32, moved to the UK in December 2019 to join her husband Hywel on a six-month finance visa. They married in February and applied for her spouse visa in May, but the closure of visa centres meant she couldn’t submit her biometrics at the time.The couple assumed that once the centres opened in June, they would be able to continue with the process, but they are still waiting – and until Sharon obtains her spouse visa, she is unable to work.Sharon, who worked as a domestic worker in Malaysia before she came to the UK, said: “It’s frustrating. I can’t work, I can’t travel. I can’t do anything right now. I was hoping to work in a care home. I know there are vacancies in care homes at the moment. I want to, but what do I do?“Financially I don’t have anything right now. I’m totally reliant on my husband. He’s also supporting my family back home in the Philippines.“I’m just at home. I have nothing to look forward to. I’m hoping none of my family get sick because if that happens, I won’t be able to go back home to see them. We’re just waiting and waiting. I’m just stuck in limbo.”Hywel, 31, who met Sharon while studying in Malaysia, said: “It’s hard to believe that they shut down all visa processing for three months, when it’s such as essential service. And it looks like there was no forward thinking about how to deal with the backlog once it reopened.“We’ve been trying to wait patiently, but there\u0027s so much uncertainty. We’ve now been told we have to go down this path of reusing biometrics, but it’s a new system that hasn\u0027t been tested, and there’s no date for it yet. Will it be one more month? Will it be three more months? We really don’t know how long this will take.”Emre and Elif Gunes said they were feeling “desperate” because, due to the delays, they have been unable to travel to Turkey to visit Elif\u0027s father, who is battling with cancer and has been in a critical state since 13 July.The Turkish couple, both of whom work as engineers in the UK, applied for an extension in April as the visas were set to expire on 19 June, but – although the process should normally take a few weeks – they still haven’t been able to submit their biometrics in order to complete the process.They were hopeful when on 1 June Sopra Steria announced that appointments would be allocated by the order of the application submission dates, but they have since been told they will be going through the new process of reusing previously submitted biometrics, and have been given no timeframe as to when it will be up and running.Elif, 29, said: ”I feel guilt and desperation every second of everyday knowing that my family needs my support more than ever before, but I cannot promise them I will be there soon. This adds another unbearable dimension to my existing sorrow and fears.“My heart beats fast whenever my phone rings not only because I am scared to hear any more bad news about my father’s situation but also I do not know what is going to happen to my job and life here if I choose to go home. Do I have to leave my job and life behind just because this visa extension process is not working properly? This is the pressure I am under constantly.”Emre, 31, said that on top of the distress of being unable to see his father-in-law, he was concerned about losing his job and, due to the current situation, being unable to find a new one: “It was already too much stress for me. What I am going to do if I lose my job due to pandemic? Will it be possible to find a new job with sponsorship?”Debasish Dash, a mathematician who has been working in the UK since 2016, has been unable to take up a job as a lecturer at Strathclyde University, which he was supposed to start at the beginning of July, due to being unable to complete the visa process.The 33-year-old Indian national, who applied for a Global Talent Visa – which the government introduced in February to attract “talented and promising iniduals in specific sectors” – is currently working at Cambridge University in a job that he was supposed to have left a month ago. The university has been able to source additional research funding for him to continue, but this will end in August.“I will be unemployed. Researchers are not paid a lot. Because of the government’s mistake I’ll have to dig into my savings and start paying my rent and my bills from my savings. It just makes no sense,” he said.“It’s nonsense. Everything was in place for me to start the new job in July, but now I don’t know how long I will have to wait because the government is not telling us anything.“Banks and post offices were open. Why were visa centres closed for two months? Even since they’ve opened, why is there a complete lack of urgency? They’re very slow and they’re giving us no timeframe. They’re trying to attract talented people, yet they’re putting me through this stress.”Another Indian national, who didn’t want to be named, said he was afraid to go outside in case anyone in authority requested to see his residence permit, which he is currently unable to provide because his visa ran out on 30 May, and he hasn\u0027t been able to process his new one because has been told to wait for the new biometrics service.The 25-year-old, who moved to the UK in January 2017 and works in the IT sector, said: “I find it tough to go out because police may ask for your permit to stay in the UK and I don’t have that. I’ve hardly been out in the last two months.“I’m worried. I don’t have any proof of my status to show I’m eligible to be in this country. I can’t do anything. It’s important to have freedom and to have a visa to show you\u0027re allowed to be in this country. What we’re going through is something no one is noticing.”The young man said he was also distressed by the fact that his sister had recently given birth to her first child in India, and he had been unable to travel to see his family“I want to know what will happen to me. I don’t be waiting like this. My parents in India are very scared about what will happen to me. I’m a 25-year-old inidual whose dreams came true when he got a job in the UK. But everything has become so bad, he added.A Sopra Steria spokesperson said: “We recognise it has been a difficult time for people unable to access appointments because of the global pandemic.They confirmed that the firm was looking to introduce new measures involving the reuse of fingerprint biometrics that have been recorded in a previous application, and said more information would be provided on this very soon.The spokesperson added that since the phased reopening of centres on 1 on June, the company had made “significant” progress in reducing the number of customers waiting for an appointment and was working to release new appointments.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on some visa services as we operate with a reduced capacity to observe social distancing. We’ve adapted our working practices in order to clear applications as soon as possible, which includes reusing the fingerprint biometrics of some of our customers to re-enrol and stop people having to attend in person. “UK Visas and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Attendees will be questioned virtually, in keeping with coronavirus restrictions.And here\u0027s a preview from Reuters, too:The CEOs of four of America\u0027s largest\u0026nbsptech\u0026nbspfirms will testify before U.S.\u0026nbspCongress\u0026nbspon Wednesday in a hearing that promises a healthy dose of political theater, while also offering a window into the thinking of lawmakers trying to rein in Big\u0026nbspTech.Facebook Inc\u0027s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon Inc\u0027s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet Inc-owned Google\u0027s Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc\u0027s Tim Cook - who together represent about $5 trillion of the U.S. economy - are set to speak before the House Judiciary Committee\u0027s antitrust panel.Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline has been looking in to allegations by critics that the companies have hurt competitors and consumers with their business practices and seemingly insatiable appetite for data.The CEOs plan to defend themselves\u0026nbsphttps:reut.rs2P4lpYN\u0026nbspby saying they themselves face competition and by pushing back against claims they are dominant, which has led to fears the hearing will bring up little new information to hold the companies accountable in the long term.\u0026nbsphttps:reut.rs2P4lpYNThe hearing marks the first time the four CEOs have appeared together before lawmakers, and will also be the first-ever appearance of Bezos before\u0026nbspCongress.The hearing is less about substance and is designed to bring attention to\u0026nbspCongressman Cicilline and the work the subcommittee has been doing for the past year, said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads\u0026nbsptechnology and innovation at Stand Together, a group that sides with\u0026nbsptech\u0026nbspcompanies that have come under fire from lawmakers and regulators in Washington.The hearing will also test U.S. lawmakers\u0027 ability to ask sharp, pointed questions that reflect an understanding of how Big\u0026nbspTech\u0026nbspoperates. Previous high-profile hearings involving\u0026nbsptech\u0026nbspcompanies have exposed the somewhat limited grasp of Washington politicians of how the internet and\u0026nbsptechnology work.It will also offer lawmakers from both parties a chance to bring up the topic of content censorship - an increasingly sore point for Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly complained of anti-conservative bias at Big\u0026nbspTech\u0026nbspcompanies.A detailed report with antitrust allegations against the four\u0026nbsptech\u0026nbspplatforms and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall by the committee, which has separately amassed 1.3 million documents from the companies, senior committee aides said.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s the Associated Press\u0027s look ahead to what is likely to happen today, and the questions the CEOs are expected to face:Four Big\u0026nbspTech\u0026nbspCEOs — Facebook\u0027s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon\u0027s Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple — are set to answer for their companies\u0027 practices before\u0026nbspCongress\u0026nbspas a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.The four command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them is the world\u0027s richest inidual (Bezos) another is the fourth-ranked billionaire (Zuckerberg). Their industry has transformed society, linked people around the globe, mined and commercialized users\u0027 personal data, and infuriated critics on both the left and right over speech.Critics question whether the companies, grown increasingly powerful after gobbling up scores of rivals, stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.The four CEOs are testifying remotely for a hearing Wednesday by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.In its bipartisan investigation, the panel collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the\u0026nbsptech\u0026nbspgiants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding is needed.Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big\u0026nbspTech\u0026nbsppoints toward possible new restrictions on its power.The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from\u0026nbspCongress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u0027 practices.\u0026nbspAnd, finally, here\u0027s Amazon\u0027s Jeff Bezos.He leans most keenly – or at least most poetically – into the patriotic, American line: in his concluding paragraphs, he says that the rest of the world would love even the tiniest sip of the elixir we have here in the US. Much of that argument is made with reference to his own biography, talking about his mother\u0027s experience of having him young, and his dad\u0027s experience of moving to the US from Cuba.Otherwise, his argument is much the same: actually, there\u0027s a lot more competition, and actually, people like using Amazon. But he also leans heavily into claims about the number of jobs being created by the company.Here\u0027s Google\u0027s Sundar Pichai. He doesn\u0027t spend quite so much time arguing that Google is not big, or that being big isn\u0027t such a bad thing – instead, his main argument is that Google is an American success story, and thereby implying that any regulation could undo that American success.We are commied to panering with lawmakers, including the members of this Commiee, to protect consumers, maintain America’s competitive technological edge in the world, and ensure that every American has access to the incredible oppounities that technology creates, he concludes.Here\u0027s Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s introductory remarks, too.He takes a similar tone to Tim Cook, and provides some similar arguments. But he leans a little more into the fact that Facebook\u0027s continuing success is not guaranteed. (He only mentions China in passing, but does stress the fact that Facebook is American, and the remarks are thought to relate to that.)I’ve long believed that the nature of our industry is that someday a product will replace Facebook, he concludes.\u0026nbspI want us to be the ones that build it, because if we don’t, someone else will.Tim Cook\u0027s full opening statement – which he will give when he appears later on –\u0026nbspcan be read here. He focuses mostly on the App Store (which is probably what the questioners will focus on with regards to him, too).His argument is along the lines the other three are expected to take, too: that his company isn\u0027t actually all that big, is not dominant in every market, and that limiting it through regulation could mean it losing out to non-US companies.Welcome to\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s live coverage of Big Tech\u0027s appearance before Congress later today.The leaders of the world\u0027s biggest tech companies – Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google – will all be questioned by US politicians eager to delve into the ways that the size and power of the companies could be being unfairly wielded, among other issues.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She speaks to Oliver Carroll\u0026nbspahead of next week\u0027s electionThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Over the next two weeks, Alexander Lukashenko faces the fight of his life. It was never supposed to be like this – not in Belarus. Not with a self-styled dictator who has previously declared election victories with 75.6 per cent, 82.6 per cent, 79.65 per cent, and 84.14 per cent of the vote. Not with a sophisticated system of modern authoritarianism, one that made independent political activity the preserve of the brave and foolhardy. This time around, the regime did all the things it usually does. Election officials refused to register the three strongest challengers from the field. Out went Valery Tsepkalo, a former ambassador to the US, Viktor Babariko, a banker, and Sergei Tikhanovski, advertising entrepreneur and popular political blogger. The latter two were arrested and jailed for their troubles. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBelarus headed for election confrontation as Lukashenko cracks downDespite all that, the 9 August election is gearing up to be the political story of the summer. Battered by criticism over his Covid-19 denialism, the five-term incumbent Lukashenko appears to be in real trouble: regularly upstaged by opposition forces, with unprecedented protests taking place across the country. Even more embarrassing for the macho leader who claims the presidency is “too much for a woman” to handle, his most obvious nemesis is female. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the wife of jailed Sergei Tikhonovsky, was propelled into politics following the arrest of her husband in May. A former translator, secretary and, for the last 10 years, a shy, stay-at-home mum, she tells The Independent she is no politician. She spent much of the last year persuading her “opinionated” husband to do what everyone else in the country did – lie low. She says she anguished as she witnessed surveillance and arrests step up in line with Sergei’s YouTube popularity and informal campaign around the end of last year. But Ms Tikhanovskaya says she knew she had “no right” to stop her husband, and the last time he was arrested, vowed to continue his work. She registered as a candidate. Extraordinarily for a declared opposition candidate in Belarus, she was allowed to run. Defying predictions the opposition would find it difficult to unite, Ms Tikhanovskaya snapped to common language with Maria Kolesnikova, the head of Viktor Barbariko’s presidential campaign, and Veronika Tsepkalo, wife of Valery, the other barred candidate. The basics of an agreement were hammered out in 15 minutes, and a full oral understanding in under a couple of hours. As the registered candidate, Ms Tikhanovskaya would lead the campaign platform. There would be just three pledges: to free political prisoners, reverse authoritarian changes to the constitution made in 1996, and to run new, free elections within six months. The three women announced their decision with a photoshoot: Ms Tikhanovskaya appeared with a clenched fist, flanked by Ms Tsepkalo with a “V” for victory sign and Ms Kolesnikova, with a heart. The symbolism was “spontaneous”, Ms Tikhanovskaya insists, and one of the very few things the group committed to paper. “Don’t think it was some campaign prepared months ago. It was all about the situation we found ourselves in.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The instant agreement. The women leaders. The fact Ms Tikhanovskaya was registered in the first place. Elements of the Belarusian opposition converged with an unusual ally, Mr Lukashenko, in blaming the invisible hand of Moscow – an ungraspable law of nature in these parts. Those who wanted evidence found it easily enough. Viktor Babariko made his money as a manager for a bank owned by Russia’s Gazprom. Valery Tsepkalo retains links with the Belarusian elite – and fled to Russia with his children shortly after his non-registration. Nationalistic opponents of Sergei Tikhanovsky have also criticised his production contracts with Russian stars. Ms Tikhanovskaya rejects the criticism as “silly rumours” that are “impossible to engage with”. She couldn’t speak on behalf of the other campaign teams, but as far as her husband was concerned, she was “more than sure” of his propriety. She saw how he had “looked for kopecks” to pay for petrol while campaigning. If they were Russian agents, they’d have a bit more cash in the bank, she reasoned. Mr Tikhonovski was a leader in protests against closer integration with Russia, and spent 30 days in prison for his trouble: “We know all about Lukashenko’s road maps with Russia, which will slowly but surely lead to full unification. Ask yourself who the pro-Russian candidate really is.”  Ms Tikhanovskaya has grown in self-assurance since the unexpected start to her political career. In conversation with The Independent, she delivers weighted positions that disguise the lack of formal political experience. On Russia, the policy was to be “friends with everyone” – but reduce dependence on oil and gas handouts. On the “painful” subject of Crimea, “de jure” it was Ukrainian, “de facto” Russian, and she wouldn’t drive people further apart by committing to either. She would stay middle of the road on the most controversial social issues like gay marriage: “I’m totally fine with same-sex relations and think any love is wonderful, but perhaps our country isn’t ready for a decision on this just yet.” Ms Tikhanovskaya’s campaign has not shied from taboos. As a registered candidate she was allowed a short broadcast on state TV, and she used it to extraordinary effect. For the first time in many years, viewers were told about political prisoners and arrests. She attacked the president’s Covid-19 denialism and alleged low ratings. Quite how popular the president is is unclear, given that independent polling is illegal in Belarus. One unofficial online poll had him at 3 per cent. That figure is likely to be highly misleading given the president’s historical electoral base. But it has become somewhat of an opposition slogan, and was unwittingly amplified by the president himself when he complained about “3 per cent” Lukashenko jokes. On this, as on much else, the old-fashioned autocrat has found himself behind the curve of modern social media and meme culture. David Marples, a professor at the University of Alberta, Canada, and long time Belarus watcher, suggests that a free vote could be quite evenly split. “Coronavirus and economic problems have conspired to undermine a belief Lukashenko can deliver,” he says. For most of his time in office, the president kept his side of an “unspoken contract” – good pensions and living standards in exchange for political submission. Now, the model is broken. “There is no obvious or honest way for Lukashenko to get the 65 per cent any respectable dictator needs,” Mr Marples says. “It’s the beginning of the end for him – perhaps not in two weeks time, but not far beyond. The fear has gone.” In a sign of increasing nervousness, Belarus’s long time leader has started to to hint at the use of force. On Friday, he said he had “learned the lessons of 2010”, when protests erupted following his claimed overwhelming victory, and were suppressed with the help of riot police. “I understand the need to have well-prepared soldiers ready just in case,” he said. Ms Tikhanovskaya, who has evacuated her children out of Belarus, tells The Independent that there wasn’t a moment where she didn’t feel “very, very frightened”. But it was a fear the whole county shared, she insists. “I hope they will listen to their people – and never, ever send in the tanks or soldiers,” she says. “We don’t want blood, we just want change.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She was very calm when she arrived and even gave the hint of a smile.“For someone who wasn’t very well known in the UK at that point, she certainly didn’t question why a photographer would randomly turn up to take her picture.“Funnily enough though, the pictures never sold at the time. The only time they started to sell was when news broke that she was with Prince Harry.”Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne, Meghan’s former agent at Kruger Cowne, denied that the pictures had been organised through the firm.She said: “It is absolutely not true. I’m not aware of any set-up pictures being done with Meghan.”Asked about how the photographers knew who Meghan was and where she would be on the  dates, she added: “I have no idea.”In sensational book Finding Freedom, the authors claim that Meghan’s co-operation with photographers ended when she met Prince Harry.It said: “While Meghan, before she met Harry, had occasionally set up a paparazzi photo or let info slip out to the press, she did everything in her power to protect the privacy of her relationship with the press.”Her dad Thomas, , was shunned for setting up pictures with a photographer before the royal wedding in .The Sun can also reveal how Meghan also became close to a renowned celebrity photographer when she was an actress in Toronto – while promoting herself “in any way she could”.The Duchess of Sussex is said to have struck up a friendship with snapper George Pimentel.Canadian photographer George, also friends with Meghan’s closest pal Jessica Mulroney, even travelled to England to get shots of the duchess on her wedding day.A source told The Sun: “He would take pictures of her and Jessica at events and on the red carpet. She would be nice to him and he photographed her at lots of dferent parties.”George repeatedly photographed Meghan, now , after she moved to Toronto from Los Angeles in  for TV show Suits.Speaking in , he said: “Meghan tried to promote herself in any way she could from the start.she has struck gold and she knows it.“Yes, they have fallen in love, but she has to take on a huge role and she lives for that!“She is getting so used to having her photograph taken, I think she’s actually getting a bit sick of it, but that’s the le. Be careful what you wish for, because you might just get it!”George even travelled to Windsor Castle, where he got a shot of Meghan on her wedding day to Harry – claiming the royal couple recognised him in the crowd and waved.Afterwards he said: “She totally looked at me and recognised me. And I’m not just saying that. She gave me a wave and she gave me a great smile.”Paparazzi photographers in Toronto told The Sun that Meghan was not famous enough before she met Harry to set-up pictures with them.One said: “I almost photographed her once, but lost her. I wouldn’t have made a dime out of the pictures anyway.”Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne, Meghan’s former agent at Kruger Cowne, denied that the pictures had been organised through the firm.She said: “It is absolutely not true.

Police carry a container towards the site where they started digging in an allotment area in Seelze, near Hannover, Germany.Suspect, Christian B, is said to have lived there for a while some years ago.The plot is four miles from Christian Bs last known fixed address in Hanover and just two miles from where the -year-old worked in a car workshop.The suspect is said to have been living at the site in around  or  in a caravan after ing from Portugal, Haz.de reports.An unnamed source told Bild that Christian B had once lived on the site in a caravan for a short while.One neighbour was said to have recognised him from the photo, and recalled seeing his yellow and white VW Camper van, which German police last month appealed for information on.They added Christian B was often seen with the VW at the allotment where he also had two dogs and where he had often rowed with locals.German police searching a garden today on the outskirts of Hannover, northern Germany, are using excavators, snfer dogs, shovels and rakes to investigate the plot. Investigators put up two tents and continued to dig even further into the ground after they had cut down trees and bushes earlier this week, the German news agency dpa reported.Prosecutors did not say what the investigators were looking for. At the garden plot, investigators even removed parts of the foundation of a former cabin from the ground that once stood there, dpa reported. A man on a neighbouring plot told the news agency that the garden, where blackberry bushes and a cheery tree grow, had not been used for the last two years.The site was previously home to a German suspect linked to Madeleines disappearance. Police have just  months to nail the prime suspect in the abduction of Madeleine, according to her family’s lawyer.Rogerio Alves says the clock is ticking on the -year mystery due to a -year time limit on prosecutions in Portugal.He told ITV: “We have a  years time barrier, even to manslaughter, to homicide, to certain sexual offences — and even to the most serious kind of kidnapping.“So we are still on time. But time is getting short now.”Cops are continuing their search of an allotment just four miles from Christian Bs former home in Hanover, Germany.Forensic officers and snfer dogs were seen hunting through the allotment for clues # with an underground tunnel at the centre of the dig.A former friend said Christian B fantasised about creating a Josef Fritzl-style dungeon at his home.Christian B’s pal said: “He had a cellar and he said he wanted to line it with heavy plates, like the guy in Austria.”The sex offender allegedly revealed his fantasy to a pal while living in the German city of Brunswick after ing to his home country from Portugal.Christian Bs pal # who wanted to remain anonymous # led a TV crew to the house where the twice convicted paedophile was living around .He alleged that the now -year-old German had confided in him that he dreamed of turning the cellar of his rented home into a basement liar.Christian B is said to have wanted to create a dungeon like the one Fritzl built with soundproof walls.There is no evidence to suggest the suspect ever followed through on this idea.Christian Bs pal said: #He had a cellar and he said he wanted to line it with heavy plates, like the guy in Austria.#Detectives say they have #strong evidence# Madeleine is dead after uncovering a trove of pictures and videos buried by suspect Christian B.Some , pieces of potential evidence was dug up which had been buried at an abandoned German box factory owned by Christian B.It is alleged at least some of this disturbing material includes videos and pictures of his suspected crimes # with the files found on hard drives and USB sticks in a plastic bag.The material was buried alongside his dead dog at the dilapidated and rubbish filed site in Neuwegers­leben.German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters declined to confirmany of the pictures and videos includes evidence linked to the Madeleine case.Christian B was a twisted loner at school who was hated by all the other children, a former classmate revealed.The murder suspect spent his days annoying the other children and getting into a string of fights.He also goaded teachers but then laughed in their face when they reacted, the former pupil revealed.He told The Sun: “I have only ever had one fight in my le – and that was with Christian B.“He spent a year being sneaky and snidey with me, never stopping with the comments.“One day I exploded and told him I wished he would go back to the children’s home from where he had come from.“We all knew he was adopted, so I shouldn’t have said that but I lost my temper with him.“He jumped on me and we traded punches until a teacher pulled me apart.“Everyone hated him in class and they all kept their distance.“But it wasn’t just the children – it was the teachers as well.CHRISTIAN B was a career criminal and repeat sex offender who lived in Portugal when Madeleine went missing in .: Born, probably in Baia, Germany.: Some minor crimes before a string of thefts.: On trial for the first time, aged , for child sex abuse and ­sentenced to two years.: Got out early and started dealing drugs.: Goes to Portugal with his then girlfriend.

A spokeswoman for the Braunschweig prosecutors office only said Tuesday that the investigation on the site was connected to their investigation regarding Madeleine. The prime suspect in Madeleine McCanns disappearance exploited the EUs open borders to evade justice, judges were told.The claims came when Christian Bs lawyer appeared at the European Court of Justice to argue he should be freed from jail on a technicality over his conviction for a rape in Portugal.Friedrich Fulscher said it was “unconstitutional” his client had been tried for the sex attack in Praia da Luz on a -year-old woman as it breached international law.The rape occurred in , which was two years before the Brit youngster disappeared while holiday with her family in the resort.Fulscher said last week that Christian B should not have been put on trial as the charge was not part of the arrest warrants issued to extradite him from Portugal to Germany in  and Italy to Germany in . EU law states that people extradited on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant can only be prosecuted for crimes listed in the paperwork.Christian B is currently jailed in Kiel in Northern Germany.Lawyers for the German government argue he has no right to challenge his arrest and say he “made the most of open European borders.”Felix Halabi told the court: “He flouted the rules. Despite the requirement to stay in the national territory  he did not stay, he left for Italy.“In the case we are looking at the suspect made the most of open European borders.”On May , , Madeleine McCann, three, vanished from her bedroom in the apartment her family were staying in at the Praia da Luz resort in Portugal while her parents, Kate and Gerry, ate with friends at a nearby restaurant.The apartment was broken into while Madeleine and her twin baby siblings were asleep, and local police concluded it was a kidnapping.The family voiced concern at what they called was a slow initial police response and a failure to secure the crime scene.In the following days, the McCanns turned to the media to help locate their daughter, and the case attracted global attention with soccer stars David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo joining the appeals for information.The media focus on the case led to reported sightings of Madeleine across the globe. However, the early investigation by Portuguese police produced no major leads.The following July, the Portuguese police dropped their investigation because of a lack of evidence.In , the British police began their own investigation – Operation Grange – saying they had identied  potential suspects.Later that year, they released an e-fit image of a number of men, including one of an unidentied suspect they particularly wanted to trace.Soon after, Portuguese prosecutors ordered the case to be reopened by local police.The new inquiry led Portuguese police to interview four suspects, but they were later cleared of any involvement, and a search by British detectives of wasteland near Praia da Luz also failed to provide a breakthrough.In June , British and German police said they had identied a new suspect in the case, a -year-old German man.Prime suspect Christian B lived in the Algarve between  and  and burgled hotels and holiday flats as well as trading drugs.Madeleine McCann was three when she disappeared while on holiday with her family in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May  .German investigators have alleged that Christian B, , killed her soon after abducting her from a holiday apartment in the resort.That’s despite British police continuing to treat her vanishing as a missing persons probe.He is in jail in Germany for drug dealing, and is appealing against a conviction for the  rape of a -year-old woman, also at Praia da Luz.The paedo is a suspect in a string of unsolved crimes, reportedly including an alleged attack on a -year-old British girl in the resort in , one of a series of incidents where young girls were targeted.German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the investigation into him, previously told the PA news agency that prosecutors have “concrete evidence”, but not “forensic evidence” that Madeleine was killed by the suspect.He said they may “know more” than Scotland Yard, who are still treating the case as a missing person investigation.There has also been search activity in Portugal.Earlier this month police and ers in the Algarve examined three disused wells around  miles from Praia da Luz.German cops have dug up a garden in Hanover believed to be linked to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.Forensic officers and snfer dogs were seen hunting through the allotment in the city where chief suspect Christian B once lived.Forensics have been probing land between Hanover-Ahlem and Seelze-Letter since .am local timetoday # even bringing in a digger to clear the area.Locals said up to  police officers have been at the scene.The allotment, in the Hanover suburb, is an hours drive from the town of Braunschweig, the last fixed home of Christian B.The public prosecutors office in Braunschweig told The Sun Online the action was linked to the probe into Madeleine, who in Portugal  years ago.In a statement, prosecutor Julia Meyer said: #I can confirm that the search is in connection with our Madeleine McCann investigation.#However, I will not comment on the background and aim of this action or the status of the ongoing investigations.#German police previously discovered a trove of pictures and videos allegedly buried by Christian B at a German box factory in Neuwegers­leben.Detectives confirmed in that find they dug up , pieces of potential evidence.It is alleged at least some of this disturbing material includes videos and pictures of his suspected crimes.The files were found on hard drives and USB sticks in a plastic bag # and it was buried alongside his dead dog at the dilapidated and rubbish filed site.Chief prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters however declined to confirmany of these pictures and videos includes evidence linked to the Madeleine case.The Madeleine McCann suspect has tonight dropped his bid to be freed from prison early as cops search allotments near his home.Christian B had been trying to cut short his current jail term for drug offences in Germany, but his lawyers announced today the application has been withdrawn.Christian B was already due for parole after being given time off for good behaviour from a  month sentence imposed by a German court in .But he has now withdrawn the application for early release and will stay caged until late January next year.A seven year jail term for the  rape of an elderly American widow in Praia da Luz is due to kick in then.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Teenagers, it turns out, are a bit of an ordeal.Studies show that mums and dads of teens are  per cent more stressed than  years ago.There’s not just the financial pressures from teens, the constant keepie-uppie with phones, computers and fashion, but the added pleasure of social media.Then throw into the mix hormones, curfews, risky behaviours, smoking, drinking and sex and you have a ­wonderful pottage of purgatory.When your children reach their teens they need to question your authority in order to find the impetus to break away and become independent adults. And they don’t do this lightly. No, they make sure they also judge and question your parenting and basically suck the le out of you.For most of us women it also often coincides with the menopause and ­possibly mid-le crises. I mean, could there be a more perfect storm  Unsurprisingly, girls are more antagonistic towards the female parent. And research shows the task of setting limits for their teenagers falls more to mothers than it does to fathers.I have four childrenand they are all very dferent. One no longer lives at home. He’s  and is my Goldenballs, as his teenage years really lulled me into a  sense of security, being largely painless.I also have two girls, aged  and , plus a boy of . So far . . . and I do love you, girls, BUT . . . the boys are proving simpler, less complicated. Unconscious bias, possibly.Lockdown with these hoodlums forced me to question my sanity, made me feel like I was in freefall and wonder what the hell I had been thinking all those times in the past when my ­Fallopian tubes would jump for joy as soon as I saw a man.I’m a liberal parent. I haven’t sought to make my children my “friends” but I ­certainly wasn’t prepared for the ­contempt, defiance, audacity and ­confrontation that has arrived. About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged. He turns  in November and his fiancée Emma Krokdal is .We shrug this off because a he’s a bloke, b age is just a number and c what is  years between two lovers Except when I was questioned ahead of my appearance on Celeb First Dates Hotel last year about what age range I would consider for a partner, without a pause I said: “Twenty-five to .” My daughters were HORRIFIED.I’m nearly  and the idea of an older woman with a far younger man is deemed unthinkable and distasteful. Yet a handsome man marrying an adolescent girl is much more palatable.Well, I’m not having it. Don’t you dare give me the side eye when I walk with my future -year-old beau! OK, a girl’s gotta dream.A ROBUST, toned, muscled, strapping, athletic, sturdy, brawny, vigorous, rippedman has been parading up and down Oxford Street in London in his birthday suit with his plumbing shielded only by a feeble face mask.

German researchers now claim they have trained dogs who can also detect coronavirus from someones saliva. The potentially ground-breaking study was piloted by the University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover, the Hanover Medical School and the German Armed Forces.They found that,properly trained, dogs were able to discriminate between human saliva samples infected with SARS-CoV- and non-infected samples with a whopping success rate of  per cent overall.There is hope that this could help prevent further outbreaks due to the rapid nature of the testing. It could also lead to instant testing at sporting events and airports, allowing countries to scrap some quarantining measures and empty stadium rules.To conduct the study, researchers trained eight dogs from Germanys Armed Forces for one week. The trained canines snfed the saliva of more than , people that were either healthy or infected with the virus. Samples infected with Covid- were distributed at random and neither the animal handlers nor the researchers on site knew which ones were positive.In a Youtube video on the project, Maren von Koeckritz-Blickwede, a professor at the university who conducted the study, says researchers think dogs can do this because the internal processes of an infected person completely change.She said: We think that the dogs are able to detect a specic smell of the metabolic changes that occur in those patients.Ms Von Koeckritz-Blickwede says the next step is to train dogs to dferentiate Covid- samples from other diseases like the flu, while other research will also need to be carried out.

What we saw in  was the virus change and the second wave was dferent from the first wave and it affected a dferent group of people - particularly younger people.The Spanish flu pandemic - the deadliest outbreak of the virus in history - emerged in March  with the hallmarks of a seasonal virus.As it coincided with the First World War, the virus spread through army troops from across the globe.  Cases appeared to drop off over the summer - and there was hope at the beginning of August  that the virus had run its course.But from September to November of that year, the death rate skyrocketed and unlike the first wave, this strain affected young, healthy people too.Experts describe it as W curve - where there are high numbers of deaths among the very young and old, as well as a huge spike in the middle, with otherwise healthy  to -year-olds being struck down.The pandemic ended by the summer of , as those had been infected around the world had either died or developed immunity, according to History.In , scientists revealed that they had solved the mystery of how the Spanish started and why it became so deadly.A study by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that people born after  had not been exposed to the kind of virus which devastated the world in .This explains why the deadly pandemic largely targeted young adults while older patients, who had built up some immunity, would often make a full recovery, reports National Geographic.Prof Kirby stressed that people who are overweight may also be at a higher risk of a second wave of coronavirus.He said: We do have a massive problem with weight in this country and we do need to address it. A message that came from this conference to patients all over the world isyou want to protect yourself against the second wave that is coming down the track then getting fit and losing weight is absolutely crucial.Earlier this week, the Government announced its strategy to tackling the obesity crisis in the UK.The new “Better Health” campaign, run by Public Health England, calls on everyone to “embrace a healthier lestyle”.Supported by the NHS, the scheme will allow GPs to refer more patients to the likes of WeightWatchers.GPs will also prescribe exercise, such as cycling and gym classes, and patients will be given access to weight loss apps.Staff in doctors’ surgeries will also be trained as “healthy weight coaches” to give people advice on how to stay trim.Meanwhile, shops will be banned from offering Buy One Get One Free deals on junk food and placing treats near store entrances and tills.Large restaurants, cafes and takeaways must put calorie labels on menus, so customers can make informed choices.And adverts for food high in fat, sugar or salt will be axed from TV and websites before the pm watershed.Ministers will consult on expanding this to cover all times of day and night.Health charities last night welcomed the “world-leading” plans.But critics said it will push up food prices and see cash-strapped families losing out on supermarket bargains.Evidence of a link between obesity and increased risk from Covid was a “wake-up call” to ministers.Mr Johnson has lost over a stone by exercising and watching his food since his brush with the virus. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There are also claims that their friends hoped to intimidate jurors.PC Harpers mum has slammed the decision, saying she was “utterly and bitterly disgusted with the outcome” of the trial which “let down” her hero son.His widow spoke of endless sprawling dark in a heartbreaking letter to her tragic husband on what would have been their first anniversary.After the verdict she described her husband as selfless, beautul and heroic and called his killers senseless, barbaric and brutal.Sentencing will take place on Friday, July .Speaking outside the Old Bailey, she told reporters: I honestly thought I would be addressing you after a very dferent verdict.“I had planned to talk of the beautul future Andrew and I had before us, I expected my words to be so very dferent and in all honesty I am for the second time in the space of one year utterly shocked and appalled.The decisions made in these courts by strangers will never change the outcome that had already come to pass. For many, many agonising months we have hoped that justice would come in some way for Andrew.We have put our faith in the justice system and all who work within it.We have waited with baited breath and heavy hearts as the dedicated prosecution barristers and investigation team of Thames Valley Police officers have worked tirelessly and who we thank sincerely for all they have done, as they stood in our corner and fought to make sure these men were made to repent for their barbaric crimes.No verdict or sentence will ever bring my incredible, selfless and heroic husband back.The results from this trial I had hoped would bring justice but in reality make no dference to the heart-wrenching pain I will continue to feel for the rest of my le.She continued: Andrew was taken from us on that horrendous night last year and his le was stolen and the lives of his family and friends altered forever. This crime, whatever the outcome deliberated over in court, was brutal and senseless.The way in which Andrew was robbed of his le we all know to be barbaric and inexplicable. I am immensely disappointed with the verdict given today.Andrew served in Thames Valley Police with honour. He went out night after night risking his le for the safety and the wellbeing of the innocent as all police officers do with passion.Ultimately he laid down his le for us all and it pains me more than I can ever explain that this has not been appreciated by the very people who should have seen his heroic and selfless duty as so many other members of the public - total strangers - clearly do.Myself and Andrews family will never come to terms with our new lives, we will never understand how such a beautul, loving, decent human being could be dealt this fate.I now have my own le sentence to bear and believe me when I say it will be a lot more painful, soul destroying and painful journey than anyone facing a meagre number of years in prison will experience.Myself and our family will spend the rest of our days missing him, loving him and being utterly proud of the incredible man that he was.We will never forget the kindness that we as a family have received from all who have supported us over the last year - friends, family and total strangers and the almighty unity of the thin blue line.

On opening the storage compartment the two young African men clamber out, one knocking a laptop onto the tarmac. In a sweary rant one male member of the family lashes out at the men, as they are accused of stealing the contents of the box before stowing away.

In Spain the number of cases has shot up, forcing the UK to reimpose  daysapos quarantine on anyone who s from there.  Itaposs not quite the same picture in England, where as far as the figures show, thereaposs been no huge rise. But just as pubs, cafes, hairdressers and gyms reopen, there have been worrying local outbreaks in Oldham, Luton, Blackburn, Leicester and more. And across England as a whole, a steady fall in the number of new cases has now levelled off. According to one measure, the number of positive tests each day has risen % since the start of the month.That will worry many people as more rules are lted on August  - with people in England encouraged to go back to work, and the vulnerable no longer needing to shield. So what do the statistics say  We look a few of the figures that will be worrying the PM - and the nation. Boris Johnson said yesterday: Clearly we now face, Iaposm afraid, the threat of a second wave in other parts of Europe and we just have to be vigilant and we have to be very mindful.A Downing Street source later told the Daily Mail : The PM is extremely concerned by what heaposs seeing abroad and fears we could be seeing the same thing here in a fortnight.A No spokesman declined to comment today on the report in the Mail. But askedthere could be a second wave in the UK in two weeks, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Breakfast: There is always a risk. We have been clear all along that there is a risk. Hereaposs why they could be worried. . New case numbers are no longer falling in England  The number of new coronavirus cases is no longer falling in England, official figures showed on Friday. The Office for National Statistics announced a steady decline in number of people testing positive for Covid- over recent months has now levelled off.The watchdog estimated that in the week to July , around one in , people in had coronavirus in the community in England. The previous weekaposs bulletin put the figure at one in ,.And there were an estimated , new cases per day, compared with , the previous week.The ONS stopped short of saying cases actually rose - because each weekaposs statistics cannot be directly compared. There are also very high levels of uncertainty, because the ONS is uses a model to estimateallcoronavirus cases in England - not just people who test positive.We explain the separate data on people testing positive below.  The number of people testing positive for Covid- in England has been slowly creeping up for weeks. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in England had fallen to  on July , the lowest since March. But since then the number has gradually ticked up and hit  on July  - a rise of %. The data, issued by Public Health England, could of course be due to more people getting tested for coronavirus - therefore more people testing positive. But whatever the cause, it shows confirmed cases are certainly not levelling off below , and could indicate rises or outbreaks in parts of the nation. The Daily Mail reports there has been an even higher % rise in new cases over a similar period. We used Public Health Englandaposs recommended method to calculate the number of new cases per day - looking at the dates tests were taken, not the date the results came back. But both methods - ours and the Mailaposs - show a steady rise in confirmed cases. For comparison, the rolling average of confirmed cases hit a peak of , on April . . Cases have surged in Oldham - and itaposs only one area where there are problems  Oldham, Greater Manchester, was the latest council yesterday to announce local restrictions after a coronavirus outbreak. It followed Leicester, Luton and Blackburn, all of which have barred residents from exiting lockdown at the same speed as the rest of England. The figures in Oldham show just how quickly the virus can spread. The council saw  cases in the week to  July - up % from  the week before. In Blackburn, the number of new people testing positive per , residents rose from  to  to  over the most recent three weeks. Over the same three-week period in Luton, the number of new positive tests per , residents rose from  to . Spain has been an example to the rest of Europe of how quickly a second wave could descend from where in Europe. The number of Covid- cases in Spain being reported to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control almost doubled last week. The public health body registered , cases in the week to July  and , in the week to July . While the figures canapost be directly compared to the UKaposs - for example, they record zero Spanish cases on weekends - they were worrying enough for the UK to clamp down with new rules on quarantine. Boris Johnson said: Letaposs be absolutely clear about whataposs happening in Europe, amongst some of our European friends.Iaposm afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic.

And after just a few weeks of residents enjoying visitors to their home and apossocial bubblesapos, they have now been banned.The boroughaposs , residents must also keep two metres apart from friends and family when seeing them outside, the Manchester Evening News reports.From Friday, vulnerable and elderly people who have been shielding are now being asked to continue to do so for another two weeks. Ed and Ann Jones, from Lees, said that people in Oldham should have followed the rules to begin with. I thought itaposd be over by now, Ed sighed, If people had obeyed the rules to begin with, weaposd be all right now. People havenapost been doing it, -year-old Ann said.  Like with the raves that theyaposve had. I donapost think the younger ones understand how itaposs actually affecting people. I didnapost go in a supermarket from March for three months. The only people Iaposve had round is my son and my daughter. The couple questioned why the council couldnapost impose the measures on specic parts of Oldham, rather than the entire town. It would make sense to lockdown the area where these cases are rising, Oldham is a big place, Ann added. That way youaposd know who is breaking the rules.  Oldham Council said a signicant proportion of recent cases involve multiple people testing positive in a single household. Town hall chiefs said that shows household spread is a real issue - especially in cases in which large families live together in one home. If youaposve got a big family and youaposre all under one roof itaposs really hard not to mingle with other people, Ed added. The tougher guidelines are aimed at avoiding a full government-mandated local lockdown like the one that has taken place in Leicester.  In the seven days to July  there have been  new cases of the virus in Oldham. This is more than a fourfold increase from the previous week, ending July , which saw  positive cases. Just four days ago, the government had dropped the borough from its watch list of areas of concern due to a fall in the infection rate. As part of the guidelines, people are being urged to wear a mask when they cannot guarantee being able to stay two metres apart, such as in shops and on public transport.  But local business owner Pauline Jackson, who runs a shop which specialises in shoe repairs and key cutting, said masks should have been compulsory from day one. I think people would rather stay at home now than wear a mask, she said. I think from day one when shops were allowed to open that masks should have been compulsory to everybody. I think wearing the masks should have come out right at the beginning.  The -year-old from Chadderton said the lockdown has had a huge impact on her business. Weaposre not on our own, everybody is exactly the same. It hasnapost picked up, she said. We do rely on the elderly age group and theyaposre not coming out. With the elderly and vulnerable having to stay in again for two weeks that will massively impact the business.  I think itaposs going to have a very big impact on us all. Barbara Davidson has been visiting her daughter Angela and grandchildren since the lockdown measures were eased earlier this month. Shopping in the town centre with her daughter she asked: So are we doing something illegal now by being together  Itaposs a big change for peopleall of a suddengoes back to a lockdown, she added.  June Brooks from Hathershaw has been visiting her son every Tuesday. The -year-old said sheaposs not surprised the cases are rising. But Marie, a carer from Springhead, said she was shocked to hear about the new, tougher restrictions. I havenapost really noticed anyone not following the rules, but town today seems quite busy really, she said.  It is a worry when the cases are rising quite signicantly. Iqbal, a taxi driver in Oldham, said the tougher restrictions will impact his familyaposs Eid celebrations on Friday. Itaposs like our Christmas, he said. Weaposve just been getting things back to normal.  The mosques have opened up again and people are coming and going, so it will be back to square one again. Youaposve just got to be careful, check your temperatures, make sure nobody has been in contact with anyone and just be careful. It will affect Eid because itaposs a big gathering so I donapost know how itaposs going to work out. All the family usually gets together. Deputy council leader and cabinet member for COVID- recovery Arooj Shahsaid the best way to avoid infection is limiting contact with others and staying home wherever you can, including working from home where possible.  She urged people to meet in groups of no more than six people from dferent households when outside, and said gatherings larger than six should only take placeeveryone is exclusively from two households or support bubbles. It is against the law for gatherings of more than  people to take place in private homes, including gardens and other outdoor spaces, and for a range of other events, including weddings, civil partnership ceremonies and services, community activities and support groups the government advice is the same, Cllr Shah added. Earlier this month, it was announced that the borough had been chosen as one of four pilot sites in the country testing people who do not have symptoms of coronavirus. Katrina Stephens, director of public health for Oldham, urged anyone with symptoms to book a coronavirus test online.

The unfortunate child must now spend up to two months in a hip to toe cast, but despite the incident sheaposs still desperate for a pet dog of her own.The Edinburgh girl is recovering well at home and her parents have issued a warning to dog owners to be more careful in public places, reports the Daily Record.

Mum Mhairi, , said: It was two dogs owned by two dferent owners and they were just playing and excited to see each other, but they basically ran full tilt and took Maggie out and skittled her. They just skfed our nine-month-old who was sitting down by my feet at the time.  I did not notice them coming straight towards us and it all happened in a flash. I scooped Maggie up and when I tried to put her back down on the sand, the minute her foot was on it I knew that was not possible, so I carried her off the sand to a grassy area and bench where my brother was sitting. Mhairi said one of the dog owners came over to see how Maggie was but the owners of the other dog appeared to have disappeared without an apology after the incident. Paramedics moved Maggie onto a stretcher and drove her to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, where she had the bone realigned and was put in a cast. X-rays taken at the time showed a clean break of Maggieaposs left femur bone just a few centimetres above the knee cap. Dad Gregor added: Should your dog be running around at full tilt when other people are around  Maybe owners should rein them in around kids. These were decent sized dogs going at high speed and, in some way, itaposs lucky Molly did not bear the brunt because the situation could have been worse.

Christian Brueckner lived off-grid at the vegetable garden near Hanover, Germany in , locals have claimed. The convicted sex offender reportedly had no interest in growing vegetables but lounged around drinking beer and told people he was a car mechanic while living in a van. The gazebo has since been destroyed but German media reports today that police digging up the site have found the cellar and are searching it for evidence about Madeleineaposs disappearance. Wolfgang Kossak, who lives in a neighbouring property, said the search was “ominous”.  He said many of the plots were sub-let and he recalled a stranger who “caused a lot of trouble” visiting the site around  and . According to local newspaper HAZ, detectives discovered and searched the cellar of a gazebo which had once stood at the garden. Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Kossak said: Christian Brueckner had the garden next to mine. He arrived in  and left within a year. He told me that he living off the grid, that he had not registered with the authorities – no one knew he was there. The building was not really a house, you might call it a shed. But it had a cellar and underneath there would be foundations.He said the buildings on Brueckneraposs plot of land were demolished in . He added that Brueckner would talk of his preference for southern Europe due to the climate and that the rapist had a VW Transporter van and parked it next to the allotment and lived in the vehicle. Police have said a camper van that was spotted in the Praia da Luz area in early  is vital to their investigation. Mobile phone records proved Brueckner was in Praia da Luz on the night she disappeared.  German detectives have not saidthey are looking for Madeleineaposs remains or simply evidence against Brueckner. German prosecutors have said they believe the missing youngster, who vanished from her Portuguese hotel room in , is dead. Police in Portugal have also renewed search efforts based on reports that the German suspect stayed in the area in a beat-up RV at the time Madeleine went missing. They have unsuccessfully searched around  wells for human remains. Mr Kossak said that Brueckner disappeared in  and he never saw him again.

Police remain at the private garden which is thought to have once been owned by convicted sex offender Christian Brueckner where he may have once lived.Detectives have discovered and searched the cellar of a gazebo which had once stood at the vegetable garden, according to German media.This morning ground-penetrating radar equipment arrived at the site, which is near Hanover in Germany. Forensic specialists with snfer dogs were seen in the garden and authorities were using large earth-moving machinery to dig up the entire backyard, according to local news reports. Locals have described the search as ominous and there have been reports in local media that Brueckner may have lived at the allotment in a gazebo-style building.  Brueckner - who is currently in jail in northern Germany - is suspected of killing Madeleine after she vanished from her Praia da Luz holiday apartment in May , the same year that Brueckner lived at the allotment.  Asked by Bild about Brueckneraposs connection to the allotment, the suspectaposs lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher said he could not comment on the police operation.Pressed on why the allotment was being searched, Fuelscher told the newspaper that I think weaposll find out the reason soon.One local claimed the German ­paedophile lived at the ­allotment site for a short while. And it is just four miles from where Brueckner used to live in Hanover after ing from Portugal. According to local newspaper HAZ, detectives discovered and searched the cellar of a gazebo which had once stood on the site but has long since been demolished.Forensic specialists with snfer dogs were seen in the garden and authorities were using large earth-moving machinery to dig up the entire backyard. Wolfgang Kossak, who lives in a neighbouring property, said the search was “ominous”.He said many of the plots were sub-let and he recalled a stranger who “caused a lot of trouble” visiting the site around  and . Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Kossak said: Christian Brueckner had the garden next to mine. He arrived in  and left within a year. He told me that he living off the grid, that he had not registered with the authorities – no one knew he was there. The building was not really a house, you might call it a shed. But it had a cellar and underneath there would be foundations. Convicted sex offender Brueckner allegedly moved to Hanover in , the year Madeleine, aged three, disappeared from Portugal. There are strict rules governing the private allotments, people are not allowed to sleep overnight in the huts, which are hired out to city dwellers wanting a country escape.  I can confirm that the search is in connection with our Maddie McCann investigation, Julia Meyer, the spokeswoman for the prosecution told Euronews this week. Police erected a temporary fence around the site after they started their search at dawn, meaning they could only be seen through some trees. Some wore forensic suits and others used rakes and shovels to comb the area. Trees were cut down to assist the search, while several police vehicles were parked outside. Detectives have not saidthey are looking for Madeleineaposs remains or simply evidence against Brueckner.

The Department for Transport has launched a consultation which could see changes in the driveraposs rule book including making it clear where cyclists and pedestrians have priority or aposright of wayapos over drivers. The plan is trying to improve safety for pedestrians - in particular for children, older adults and disabled people. There would be new rules around what to do when you see someone waiting to cross the road as well as how drivers should deal with cyclists at junctions. Cyclists will be given clearer priority at junctions, and pedestrians clearer priority when crossing or waiting to cross the road. There would also be mention of the Dutch Reach - a method for opening your car door without endangering cyclists - as well as making sure warning sounds are working on electric cars and making sure your charging cable is not a trip hazard.  The main alterations to the code being proposed, as reported by Cornwall Live, are: Introducing a hierarchy of road users which ensures that those road users who can do the greatest harm have the greatest responsibility to reduce the danger or threat they may pose to others Clarying existing rules on pedestrian priority on pavements, to advise that drivers and riders should give way to pedestrians crossing or waiting to cross the road Providing guidance on cyclist priority at junctions to advise drivers to give priority to cyclists at junctions when travelling straight ahead Establishing guidance on safe passing distances and speeds when overtaking cyclists and horse riders. The plan reads: The consultation document is seeking views on proposed changes to The Highway Code to improve safety for pedestrians, particularly children, older adults and disabled people, cyclists and horse riders. It is important that these groups feel safe in their interactions with other road users. The document says it gives: specic consideration on overtaking, passing distances, cyclist and pedestrian priority at junctions, opening vehicle doors and responsibility of road users. The changes would be made to a number of sections of the Highway Code including:Rules for pedestriansRules about animalsRules for cyclistsRules for drivers and motorcyclistsGeneral rules, techniques and advice for all drivers and ridersUsing the roadRoad users requiring extra careWaiting and parkingAnnex : you and your bicycle Annex : vehicle maintenance, safety and security. Discussing the planned new Hierarchy of Road Users the plan reads: The ‘Hierarchy of Road Users’ is a concept which places those road users most at risk in the event of a collision at the top of the hierarchy. The road users most likely to be injured in the event of a collision are pedestrians, in particular children, older adults and disabled people, followed by cyclists, horse riders and motorcyclists. The hierarchy does not remove the need for everyone to behave responsibly. The following H rules clary this concept. It is important that ALL road users are aware of The Highway Code, are considerate to other road users and understand their responsibility for the safety of others. It adds: Those in charge of vehicles that can cause the greatest harm in the event of a collision bear the greatest responsibility to take care and reduce the danger they pose to others. This principle applies most strongly to drivers of large goods and passenger vehicles, followed by vans minibuses, cars taxis and motorcycles. Cyclists, horse riders and horse drawn vehicles likewise have a responsibility to reduce danger to pedestrians. Always remember that the people you encounter may have impaired sight, hearing or mobility, and may not be able to see or hear you. None of this detracts from the responsibility of all road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders, to have regard for their own and other road users’ safety.  There would be new rules around what to do when you see someone waiting to cross the road. They would read: At a junction you should give way to pedestrians crossing or waiting to cross a road into which or from which you are turning. You MUST give way to pedestrians on a zebra crossing, and pedestrians and cyclists on a parallel crossing. You should give way to pedestrians waiting to cross a zebra crossing, and pedestrians and cyclists waiting to cross a parallel crossing. Horse riders and horse drawn vehicles should also give way to pedestrians on a zebra crossing, and pedestrians and cyclists on a parallel crossing. Pedestrians have priority when on a zebra crossing, on a parallel crossing or at light controlled crossings when they have a green signal. Cyclists should give way to pedestrians on shared use cycle tracks. Only pedestrians may use the pavement. This includes people using wheelchairs and mobility scooters.

But according to new book Finding Freedom, the couple felt her words lacked warmth and believed it showed she wasnapost happy with their choice.  Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write: [Meghan and Harry] had seen a draft of what Buckingham Palace planned to put out in a statement that would follow theirs and its lack of warmth was a clear sign that not everyone supported their decision. On January , Meghan and Harry shared their -word statement that would change their lives forever. They said they had spend months thinking about the move, and wanted to carve out a progressive new role within this institution.  However they said they planned to continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen and to raise Archie with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born.Shortly after their message went live, the Queenaposs office shared a statement, which said they understood Meghan and Harryaposs desire to take a dferent approach, but warned it will take time to work out the details.It read: Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.  A palace source has told the BBC that senior members of the Royal Family feel hurt by the announcement. Following a series of debates and discussions, including a crisis meeting attended by the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, she released a further message, in which she broke tradition and used the coupleaposs first names rather than their official titles. She wrote: Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family. My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new le as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent le as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.

Lissie Harper had been married to PC Harper for just a month when he was killed by Henry Long, , Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both , as they tried to steal a quad bike. PC Harper, , was dragged for more than a mile along the country lanes of Berkshire when he became entangled in a tow rope attached to the teenagersapos getaway car. An Old Bailey jury acquitted all three defendants of murder on Friday, instead convicting Cole and Bowers of manslaughter. Long had previously pleaded guilty to the same charge.In an open letter posted on her Facebook page on Tuesday evening, Mrs Harper wrote to Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Lord Blunkett urging them and others to right such a despicable wrong for our country. She wrote: I implore you to hear my words, see the facts that are laid out before us, and I ask with no expectations other than hope that you might help me to make these changes be considered, to ensure that Andrew is given the retrial that he unquestionably deserves and to see that the justice system in our country is the solid ethical foundation that it rightly should be. Not the joke that so many of us now view it to be. The original trial was abandoned on the day the country went into lockdown in March, while for the retrial Mr Justice Edis ordered extra security measures amid fears of potential juror intimidation.  A female juror was discharged just a day before the remaining  started deliberating on their verdicts after she was seen by a prison officer to mouth Bye boys to the teenagers in the dock. The defendants hugged each other after the verdicts were ed following more than  hours of deliberations. Speaking outside court, Mrs Harper thanked the police and prosecution who had stood in our corner and fought to make sure these men were made to repent for their barbaric crimes. But she criticised the verdicts in the open letter on Facebook, which has been shared more than , times.

Amy Williams visited the fast food eatery in Canterbury city centre with her partner Sam Hutchinson, , on Monday when she suddenly needed to use the bathroom. The self-employed cleaner, who is  weeks pregnant, was unable to wait while Sam queued for coffee but claims a male worker told her aposyouaposre not paying with real moneyapos when she tried to access the loo. The -year-old says she was left on the verge of tears and ended up bolting out of the restaurant and went to Caffe Nero where staff allowed her to use their toilet without a problem. The furious customer now claims she will % avoid McDonaldaposs in the future as the customer service she received was awful. McDonaldaposs apologised that incorrect guidance was aposunintentionally providedapos and said the restaurant team was aposremindedapos of policies to help prevent it happening in future. Amy, from Ashford, Kent, said: I was livid. Iaposm not at the stage of aposis she pregnant or just bloated apos Iaposm full on pregnant and I wasnapost allowed to pee because I wasnapost paying with money, I was paying with a voucher. [The member of staffaposs] exact words wereaposI was paying with real money and sitting in to drink my coffee I could use the toiletapos. I was happy to give my details for Track and Trace but I really needed the loo. He pointed at my bump and said aposI understand your predicament, but youaposre not paying with real moneyapos. Itaposs not like Iaposm only just pregnant - itaposs very noticeable. When you need a wee, you need a wee.  The pair had decided to start their shopping trip with coffees as they had loyalty sticker cards - but as Sam turned around with the drinks in his hand, Amy was nowhere in sight. Amy said: I said aposwhilst he is ordering for me, is it okay to use the loo apos Iaposd understandI just walked in off the street but I didnapost. My other half was in the queue. I was technically buying something but according to him I wasnapost because I was paying with a voucher. [The member of staff] stood in front of the stairs because they were upstairs, so I couldnapost use the loo. I was about to cry. I had to run away because I needed to pee that bad. I ran away to find somewhere  to go. I ran into Caffe Nero, through the queue of people, shouted aposcan I use your looapos and they shouted back aposof course, itaposs just thereapos.  Sam got the coffees as he was ordering at the till point and I didn’t shout or anything - I just left after the guy blocking the stairs. [I then] called him when I was outside to find me. He was livid. Iaposm pregnant and he was worried I wasnapost going to be able to hold it. Amy has now vowed to apos% avoidapos McDonaldaposs and take her business where, after admitting the pair were aposreally upsetapos but didnapost want to cause a scene. Amy said: I didnapost want to go [back] to McDonaldaposs - I went to Five Guys for lunch [instead]. I was not going back to McDonaldaposs for love nor money. I will % avoid there in the future - their customer service was awful. Sam was really upset. He didnapost want to speak to the man because he would have lost his temper. We have dignity - though I nearly didnapost. We werenapost going to cause a scene in McDonaldaposs.  Everyone is really shocked. Theyaposre disgusted that they would do that. After sharing her ordeal online, many social media users were quick to voice their support for Amy. One said: Imagine being that much of a jobsworth to not let a heavily pregnant lady use the toilet. McDonaldaposs maybe give your staff some customer service training, you should be ashamed. A second added: This is shocking Amy. I expect by asking you for the details of the time and date of your visit, they will be able to identy the person who failed to deliver good customer service. This person may now receive some training, which is obviously needed. What an upsetting experience for you.

Royal commentator Katie Nicholl said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are not raising the seven-year-old to be spoilt or get special treatment but there is one telltale sign that he is the future king. Katie, who is the author of William And Harry: Behind The Palace Wall, claims Prince George is often singled out to spend more time with the Queen.Speaking to OK! she said his future as a king is being introduced to him gradually by William and Kate.She said: “George is an absolute pleasure to be around and that’s down to his parents. They want to protect him from that moment, so it’s an idea that’s being introduced to him gradually. The true enormity of what his le will one day be isn’t something he’s fully aware of yet. George gets taken away from his sister Princess Charlotte, five, and brother Prince Louis, two, for photoshoots with his dad, granddad and great-gran which Katie said he will have noticed. Footage was filmed of George learning how to make Christmas puddings alongside his father, grandfather Charles and the monarch for the Queenaposs Christmas Day message in . In January a photo was released of George with the Queen and her son and grandson.  “I think George understands, like William did from a very early age, that he’s dferent from his younger brother and sister and that he’ll have a dferent future, Katie said. “After all, he gets taken away to do photoshoots with Her Majesty the Queen, so he must notice he’s been singled out. “But I don’t think William and Kate have made a big thing of saying to George, ‘One day you will be King. “They’re not raising him to be spoilt or to have an inflated sense of his own importance. He doesn’t get special treatment just because he’s the future heir.  She said that it is believed William and Kate chose Thomas’s Battersea for Prince Georgeaposs early years of schooling because of its nurturing environment and the focus on “being kind”. “There was quite a big fuss about George’s arrival at the school. Bulletproof glass was installed and the presence of protection officers sets him apart from his peers, she said. His classmates were clearly very aware there was something dferent about him from the start. They know he’s a prince and they call him ‘PG’, which is short for Prince George.” Katie said the relaxed approach to preparing Prince George for his future could be down to how William felt as teenager when he was troubled by the sense of duty that awaited him.She said: “As a young man, William really struggled with that notion of kingship. The realisation that he had no choice about which path his le would take, that he couldn’t become a doctor or a vethe chose, weighed very heavily on him. “He got treated dferently from his younger brother. When the boys went for tea with the Queen Mother, William would get the first choice of sandwiches or cake. It was all about William. I think that’s why Diana overcompensated in terms of her affection for Harry because she was very aware that he didn’t get the same attention William got.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal family newsletter must read","story":"NewsRoyal family newsletter - the must-read email with all the days royal headlinesThe Mirrors Royal Family newsletter will bring the most important and interesting stories on the Queen, Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, William, Harry and the rest of the Firm straight to your inboxShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsJust put your email address in the box underneath this picture and we will start sending you our royal newsletter \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Stay-at-home mum Beka Garris, from Ohio, the US, has been hunting since she was  years old - a hobby sheaposs now passing onto her daughter, Isabella. The -year-old Beka is keen to pass the tradition along - and often sets off before sunrise to kill and bring home a -pound whitetail deer to feed the family. Although hunting days with a toddler in tow can be a little noisier, Beka and daughter Isabella have still managed to successfully harvest both deer and rabbit. Parents online have deemed Bekaaposs pictures to be shocking, criticising her for exposing her daughter to hunting at such a young age. But Beka is not fazed and argues she is continuing the traditions of her ancestors. Every parent has the choice to raise their children how they see fit, Beka said. Hunting with children of all ages is something our ancestors did all of the time. Itaposs not something that should be seen as aposshocking.apos  I choose to ignore what people say. The fact that my daughter loves accompanying me only strengthens my decision to take her. We love spending time in the outdoors learning about nature. My dad is an avid hunter and so he started taking me along when I was ten. Hunting and fishing became a huge part of my childhood. Now we go at least several times a week during open season spending a few hours in the woods.  Hunts with my daughter can be shorter thanI went alone as I want to make sure sheaposs enjoying herself and stays comfortable in the weather. Exposing a child to the outdoors and hunting at a young age will only help them create a stronger bond with nature. They will be raised thinking these activities are normal - as it should be. I refuse to apologise for teaching my child that food comes from the woods, water, and the garden. For Beka, thereaposs more to hunting than spending time outdoors. Wild game is reportedly better for your health compared to shop-bought meat. Itaposs nice knowing where your food comes from and knowing the time and effort I put into the hunt brings a certain satisfaction, Beka said.

David Price has devised the aposSafety Pouchapos so motorists no longer have to rummage in their glove compartment to find their licence during a traffic stop. The -year-old, who lives in New Orleans, Missouri, came up with the idea after a number of drivers were shot by police who thought they were reaching for a gun when they were pulled over. He toldhe hopes his invention will save lives. David said: When I got my drivers licence my parents sat me down and had a chat with me about the dos and donapostsI was pulled over by the cops including making sure the officers can see my moments. There have been incidents where drivers were shot because cops saw them going into their glove box and thought they were going to pull out a gun. When you reach for something it puts the traffic cops on edge as they donapost knowyou are reaching for the licence or for your gun. Police will shoot eventhere is a baby in the car. David, a political science student, said the idea first popped into his head during a class where they were tasked with inventing a product that could change society.He recalled the death of Philando Castile who was shot by a police officer in his car in St Paul, Minnesota, in July . His four-year-old daughter and fiancée Diamond Reynolds were in the car when he was fired at six times.In a Facebook live video during the aftermath, David said Philando was shot as he reached for his driving licence.People were angry when Philando died, he said. He was simply trying to get his licence when he was killed in front of his partner and daughter.  The pouch has a large clip that is attached to the sun visor so when a driver is pulled over by police they are able to pull it off and attach it to their window. When I presented my pouch to my professor he loved it, David said. He told me to make it into a real project so I have worked on it since then and Iaposm in the process of patenting it. The pouch has also been designed with a clear cover on the front so police can see the driveraposs credentials and check whether they have a disability.  David said: If someone has a physical or mental impairment such as being deaf the officer can see straight away and they are aware. I worked closely with several police officers to perfect the pouch and they all love it and say itaposs a really good thing. While drivers fear they could be shot the cops also have no idea what is going to happen when they approach a car so this is reassuring for both parties. The pouch comes in one colour only - a vibrant shade of orange - David said this is on purpose.  It is a distinctive colour so cops will be able to spot it and know its a safety pouch, he said. As more people use the safety pouch itaposll become more well known. It also comes with a sticker that drivers can display at the back of their car so police know they use a safety pouch. My mum and dad are so proud of me and everyone I tell about it say itaposs a great invention as it could save lives.  Through word of mouth David has already sold , pre-ordered pouches pending the patent being granted.His customers include Tina Lawson, the mum of American singer Beyonce. Tina posted photos of the pouch on Instagram urging her million followers to buy them for drivers in their family.She said: I am purchasing several for my nieces and nephew all of my bonus sons and daughters.  I pray for the day when we won’t need this pouch that we can reach in our glove compartment to get out a registration or insurance papers! Right now though it’s a good thing to have. As soon as you are stopped you take your pouch and put it in the window for the officer to retrieve it , so that you can keep your hands on the steering wheel.

Bartender Neil Harkin and his date Jean McAuley, , had booked a table at The Old Docks Bar and Grill in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, and were quietly enjoying each otheraposs company at their table, when their love le was thrust into the limelight. Restaurant owner Liam Shiels, , decided to prank his friend Neil, , by sitting them in the middle of the room, before joining  other friends to watch as the stunt unfolded. Liam organised a bottle of bubbly to be sent over to their table with a huge sparkler - making it look like they had just got engaged. The clip shows the couple squirming in embarrassment as the entire restaurant watches, whilst a fizzing indoor sparkler is brought over to their table. The extravagant delivery made it look like the couple were celebrating their engagement or even news of a baby - when in fact it was their first romantic night out ever. Neil, from Derry, Northen Ireland, said: There was nothing I could do. I just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me.  Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. We didnapost expect anything at all. The restaurant was packed - there wasnapost a [free] seat in the whole restaurant. Being a friend, Liam knew it was a first date so thataposs when he started his prank. As they say, the rest is history. A customer had a birthday so I thought they were going to do something [to say] happy birthday. We were sitting there having a meal and then the next thing a bottle of Prosecco came down with a sparkler on it. Prankster Liam, also from Londonderry, said: It was priceless - unbelievable. The whole place was clapping and cheering.  He text me on the Friday to book a table in the restaurant so I said aposIaposll get you squeezed inapos. We were there for a leaving do too. When they walked in he was expecting everyone to be cheering but we just said aposalright, how are you doing apos We had it arranged that weaposd put them in the middle table in the whole restaurant. When they were just finishing dinner we got the staff to get a bottle of Prosecco with a sparkler on the top of it, then played aposCongratulationsapos music around the speakers. We couldnapost stop laughing. You can hear the laughs in the background. There were  of us out and there was a few people videoing it.  Once the prank was over and dusted the couple joined Liam for a drink after their date - and Jean even agree to see him again, despite how mortied she was. Liam said: The two of them took it so, so well. The craic was great. The girl he was out with grabbed a glass and poured herself a drink. It ended well because they joined us for a drink later on that night. Neil, who has known his date since primary school, had no idea of how his night would unfold, instead presuming the music was for someone having a birthday. Neil said: This was a first date, but me and Jean went to the same primary school. Iaposve known her a long time then we hooked up and went on a date. The fella who walked out with the bottle used to play football with me - Gary, heaposs the waiter. He was in on the prank as well. We have a second date lined up now - but the first place I wonapost be going to as the Old Docks.

Nicole Hennessy, a mum-of-three, has more than , followers on TikTok, and regularly shares content of her kids, including her -year-old daughter who is seven months pregnant. Nicoleaposs followers were keen to find out more about her daughteraposs pregnancy, so after asking for her permission, she got the green light to share her story to TikTok in the hopes it would raise awareness about the topic. In the clip, instead of condemning her daughter, she educated her on the three options she had, which was greeted with a lot of praise from users for her supportive parenting style. In the clip she reenacts the very moment that she knew that her daughter was pregnant. She found a corner of a pregnancy test wrapper on the floor of the bathroom - a dead give away. Nicole then went to ask her daughter whether the test was hers.  Her daughter reassured her that the test was negative and not to worry, and headed off to school for the day. But Nicoleaposs gut instinct told her to buy a second test just in case. When her daughter got home from school that day she asked her to take the other test - it came back positive. Nicole said that her daughter was confused and visibly upset, so she suggested three options she could take. She could either continue with the pregnancy, have an abortion or arrange an adoption. Her daughter decided to keep the baby and is currently seven months pregnant as viewers can see in Nicoleaposs other videos.

For years, Japanaposs north coast had been the site of the disturbing phenomenon, with rickety fishing vessels arriving more than ,km from where they set out. In  the numbers were unprecedented with more than  damaged boats landing, containing a total of  bodies, compared to  vessels the year before. Some have speculated the weather that year was to blame and that North Koreaaposs aging fishing population had something to do with the problem. But a study by non-profit Global Fishing Watch and published today in journal Science Advances has been able to shed some light on the matter. Researchers used satellite technologies to analyse marine traffic in northeast Asia in  and , and discovered hundreds of dark fishing fleets - believed to be Chinese - have been operating in North Korean waters - apparently illegally. This meant ushering out North Korean boats and forcing them on ill-advised ventures into Russian and Japanese waters, poorly equipped for long distance travel.For foreigners, fishing in waters off the North Korean coast or trading fish caught there internationally is against the law - but it doesnapost appear to have deterred the huge swathes of rogue ships, according to the report. The paperaposs authors estimate in  and  alone these ships caught more than , metric tons of Pacic flying squid, a particularly valuable seafood - worth £ million. Jaeyoon Park, a senior data scientist at Global Fishing Watch and co-lead author of the study, said: It is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by vessels originating from one country operating in another nationaposs waters. Another author, Jungsam Lee, said the North Korean vesselsapos decision to try their luck in distant foreign waters would have proved catastrophic for many of the fisherman.  It is too dangerous for them to work in the same waters as the Chinese trawlers, he explained. Thataposs why theyaposre pushed to work in Russian and Japanese waters and that explains why some of North Koreaaposs damaged vessels showed up on the beaches of Japan. Northeast Asiaaposs waters are some of the most contested seas in the world, but fish stocks are in dramatic decline. The Pacic flying squid stocks have dropped  per cent in South Korean waters and  per cent Japanese waters since , according to Global Fishing Watch.

Moscow-based lab Gamaleya Institute is working towards a date of August , Russian officials told CNN. They told the publication that it would be given to front-line care staff first. The head of Russiaaposs sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev, spoke of the possible impact of the vaccine his organisation is helping to fund. He likened it to Sputnik, the worldaposs first satellite launched by the Soviet Union in . He told CNN: Americans were surprised when they heard Sputnikaposs beeping. Itaposs the same with this vaccine. Russia will have got there first. Despite its apparent approval being just  days away, there are big question marks hanging over the Russian vaccine. The country has not released any data about testing, rendering its safety and effectiveness unclear. The vaccine is still being tested on humans, leading to concerns about its safety. While some global vaccines are in the third phase of trials, the Russian vaccine is yet to complete its second phase. It is hoped the this will be completed by August , with the third phase carried out in tandem with the vaccination of medical workers.  More than  possible vaccines are being developed around the world to try to stop the coronavirus pandemic. At least four are in final phase three of human trials, according to World Health Organisation data - including three developed in China and another in Britain. Russian officials told CNN the scientic data on the vaccine is currently being compiled. They said it will be made available for peer review and publication in early August. The vaccine has been tested on volunteers from Russiaaposs defense ministry and Alexander Ginsburg, the director of the project.

It was a really good thing for Mason to be the leader and to have the responsibility of supporting and organising his teammates.#He has really excelled himself with this and the whole team are absolutely delighted to have raised the amount that they have.#Archie Foundation fundraising director Paula Cormack said: #It’s really heart-warming to hear about young people like Mason and his AFC Under s teammates taking on challenges like this to fundraise for Archie, and the fact they have a personal connection with the charity through their own family’s experience is all the more touching.#The boys’ fundraising really couldn’t come at a more welcome time. Sadly, we’ve had to cancel many of our fundraising events and plans this year which has turned everything upside down and left much of what we do and offer hanging in the balance.#It’s all thanks to the support of people like these amazing young lads, and the friends and family who sponsored them, that we are be able to continue to fund our vital services and we couldn’t be more grateful.#To donate, visit justgiving fundraising hannah-porterFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Aberdeen had a dry run last year when facing Chikhura Sachkhere in Georgia.As Chikhura’s stadium did not meet Uefa regulations, the Europa League qualier was switched to the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena in Tbilisi.With only a few hundred fans in attendance at the , capacity stadium, it was an eerie atmosphere and one of the most bizarre games I have ever attended. Aberdeen were able to overcome that and draw -.Saturday offers not just a chance for Scottish football to shine, but also for Aberdeen to lay down an early marker of intent for the season.Hopefully midfielder Craig Bryson can remain injury-free in the upcoming season after a frustrating debut campaign.Bryson  joined the Dons last summer with an ankle injury that saw him miss the end of the - season with Derby. He passed a stringent medical before joining the Reds.After recovering from that ankle problem, he injured the other.Bryson scored in the - friendly draw with Hibs and is ready for the new season.Cove Rangers can now fully concentrate on preparing for le in League  as the fear of being denied promotion is over.Despite romping to the League  title, Cove have been unable to fully enjoy their much deserved success – until now.A three-man arbitration  this week reached a unanimous decision to confirm the relegations of Hearts, Partick Thistle and Stranraer.Had the  decided the other way, Cove, Dundee United and Raith could have had their promotions wiped out.The case was heard in Edinburgh’s Court of Session before being referred to the Scottish FA for the arbitration process.Following a rigorous examination with many witnesses and full access to relevant documents, records, emails and telephone logs, a decision was made on Monday to uphold the relegations.Now all concerned parties must stick by it and move on.Over the last few months there has been enough ision, argument and chaos in Scottish football to last a letime.It would have been shockingCove were denied their rightful place in League One due to a situation completely outwith their control.However, I have sympathy for Hearts, Partick and Stranraer and still think a temporary two-season set-up of --- could have worked.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

The Premiership teams will be more ready for it because the league starts in August, whereas in previous years often lower league teams have been able to catch them out.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

There are a lot of young people for whom the real world is more amazing than anything you could make up.\"Again, thats another thing were born with that gets beaten out of us, and we start using the word ordinary ndash and theres nothing ordinary.\"Were surrounded by magic. You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

Nobody knew what to expect.ldquoGala day itself was amazing, from the glorious weather to the great response we got from the locals as we travelled around in convoy tooting and waving, visiting many streets of the town which the normal gala parade doesnrsquot visit.

parallel to the main B Edinburgh Road.The three-metre wide path will be created by laying hard surfacing down on the grass verge on the north side of the carriageway between the two communities.The path will run alongside the footpath between the boatyard access at Prestonpans to just past the old power station with a white line separating the cyclepath and walkway.This is the councilrsquos latest project to improvesocial distancing in the wake of the Covid- crisis.The local authority received pound.million from the Scottish Governmentrsquos Spaces for People fund to introduce ious countywide measures to make it easier to social distance in town centres and improve cycle and pedestrian paths.As well as the roadside cycle route, the speed limit on Edinburgh Road, which is normally mph, will be reduced to mph and speed limits in the twocommunities reduced to just mph.The plan for the cycle path has seen dozens of painted stones created by local schoolchildren, which line the footpath, move across to the other side of the road.The stones are a symbol of hope and unity during the Covid- crisis, and many similar displays have been created throughout East Lothian and the whole country.Councillor Norman Hampshire, environment spokesperson at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe received many comments in the public consultation around Spaces for People on the need to provide suitable space for people cycling.ldquoMany people are currently cycling this route and we need to cater for the current increase in cyclists during the pandemic period.ldquoIn common with other Spaces for People measures, this route is for temporary use as we gradually move out of restrictions and will also provide a viable alternative to the use of the private car and or public transport for shorter-distanced essential or leisure trips in the area.The works also include the introduction of temporary crossings of Edinburgh Road at either end of the route through the use of lsquobuildoutsrsquo and bolt-down bollards.In addition, the proposals also include traffic calming measures on Edinburgh Road to slow down traffic with a temporary reduction in the speed limit to mph between the two communities, in tandem with the introduction of mph limits within the communities themselves.MrHampshire added: ldquoWe were aware of a collection of painted stones that have been carefully laid by local schoolchildren alongside the existing footway along Edinburgh Road and recognise that these are important to the local community.ldquoThe community council arranged for these to be carefully collected prior to the start of the works and they have been relocated on the other side of the road."},{"url":null,"title":"column-job-figures-worrying","story":"Furloughing has

councilrsquos Local Review Body overturned the refusal on appeal after councillors ruled the proposal was better than leaving the building to fall into disrepair.And they questioned whether the design of the new property, which featured extensive glass frontage to let in light, would, in fact, make the amenity more acceptable.Planning officers had estimated the new one-bedroom property would offer just nine square metres of living space in the proposed kitchen living area.The review body was told that there was no set standard for amenity and outlook when it came to conversions like the one put forward for the building, on the townrsquos Lamer Street.Instead, Leigh Taylor, council planning advisor, said it was down to the inidual officer involved.He said: ldquoThere is no exact standard, it

It has to find a new purpose.Councillor Norman Hampshire, review body chairman and ward member, also upheld the appeal.He said: ldquoIt has to have another use either as commercial or residential and I think residential is a good fit for this building.

Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Those that belong to the pea and bean familyfor example, in summer, can store nitrogen in their roots,that can be ploughed back into the earth.Which crops make good green manures At this time of year they include mustard, fodder radish, fenugreek, buckwheat and phacelia, which can be slotted in in six to eight week gaps when the ground is cleared between crops. Some sown in early autumn, including winter beans, grazing rye and winter tares, will last through the winter and can be dug into the soil when it warms up in spring.How long do they take to grow Some, such as mustard, are fast-germinating. Two weeks after sowing youll find the ground covered with small seedlings, and after six weeks, these can be chopped and folded into the soil to add nutrients.Fenugreek is another nitrogen-fixer for summer, really fast growing and its bushy plants are great for suppressing weeds. It can be planted in late spring or summer and grown for up to three months.When do I cut them down Chop the fast-growing ones when you need the ground back. Just dig them up, chopping up the leaves and stems as you go to speed up decomposition. Leave them a few days to wilt and then dig them into the soil.Longer term crops such as alfalfa, red clover and trefoil can be left in the ground for a year and clipped from time to time to stop them from going woody. They are ideal for soil thats been overused and needs to rest.What benefits do they provide Clover, fenugreek, winter beans and alfalfa are good nitrogen-fixers, storing nitrogen in their roots, while clover and phacelia flowers are a magnet for beneficial insects, which can help pollinate crops, so leave some to flower. Italian ryegrass and buckwheat have root systems that will help break up heavy ground.When can I plant crops in the space again A few weeks after youve dug in your green manure, you can sow late crops such as onion and garlic.WhatI want to wait If you have no crops to fill the space, cover the green manure-treated bed with cardboard or landscape fabric to keep the nutrients from the green manure in, which will give you a great seedbed to sow seeds in come spring.What  can I grow to help my crops Try growing comfrey, which absorbs nutrients and minerals and can be made into a liquid feed. Just cut it down to the ground, fill a bucket with the leaves and stems of the plant, packing them in tightly and then filling the bucket with water.Set it aside for three weeks , then strain off the liquid into a container with a tight lid. When you want to feed your plants, dilute the liquid with water at a ratio of around : and feed your plants weekly into autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"books-peter-geoghegan-dark-money-reshaped-political-agenda","story":"Peter GeogheganHead of Zeus, pound.Review by Fiona RintoulON reaching chapter four of Peter Geogheganrsquos meticulously researched and highly readable new book Democracy for Sale: Dark Money and Dirty Politics, I emitted a small scream of ldquoNo!. Irsquod just learnt that ldquothe most blatant example of dark money in recent electoral politics can be traced to the south Glasgow suburb of Clarkston.The poundk-plus that the Democratic Unionist Partyspent on pro-Brexit advertising in the run up to the June  referendum on the UKrsquos membership of the European Union ndash not in Northern Ireland but Great Britain ndash was donated by an obscure body named the Constitutional Research Council . Its only named director was Richard Cook, a multiply-failed Tory candidate of Clarkston parish.This incident is totemic of the tawdry tale of secretive donors and anonymous propaganda that Geoghegan, investigations editor at independent media  openDemocracy and founder of the award-winning investigative website The Ferret, painstakingly weaves in Democracy for Sale. There are a few diamond mines and Russian ambassadors, itrsquos true, but in the main this story unfolds in unstimulating locales and features compromised mediocrities such as Cook.His business interests are nearly as convoluted as those of Arron Banks, one of the self-proclaimed ldquoBad Boys of Brexit. Drawing on the resources of a miasma of offshore companies, Banks bankrolled the belligerent, anti-immigration Leave.EU campaign with the ldquobiggest donation in British political history.The National Crime Agency investigated Banksrsquo pound.m donation to anti-EU causes amid mounting speculation about the source of the funds, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. Banks hailed the ruling as vindication of his Brexit campaign, but others saw it as ldquotacit acceptance that companies in offshore jurisdictions could underwrite political donations.The campaign for Brexit mingled such offshore money with obscure onshore funding. The CRCrsquos donation to the DUP encapsulates the problem. The CRC is an unincorporated association, not subject to the normal disclosure requirements that an incorporated company must meet. According to Geoghegan, unincorporated associations are ldquoblack boxes that can be set up for the sole purpose of funnelling money to political campaigns, with little or no transparency.The influential European Research Groupis also an unincorporated association. Geoghegan shows how the ERG, a party within a party that ldquobrought down a Conservative prime minister and called the tune on Brexit, was able to trouser around pound, in taxpayer money between  and  ldquothanks to a little-used Westminster convention. Another scream moment.The tale of how dark money reshaped the political agenda in the UK and beyond pullulates with such dim-lit legal entities. The same people and companies ndash Cambridge Analytica, Dominic Cummings, Nigel Farage ndash keep reappearing from the mists of an opaque complex of vested interests.Geoghegan claries that he does not believe Brexit was ldquosome grand conspiracy. The British state and the political and business establishment were behind Remain. Instead, he says, the referendum and its aftermath reveal something more fundamental and systemic: ldquoa broken political system that is ripe for exploitation.Arguably, the groundwork for Brexit ndash and for Donald Trump and Boris Johnsonrsquos victories at the ballot box ndash was laid by another brand of unaccountable entity: the think tank. In theory, think tanks do research and publish research papers in practice, says Geoghegan, ldquoWords like lsquoinstitutersquo and lsquocentrersquo give an appearance of academic rigour to what is essentially paid-for lobbying.In the book, Geoghegan illuminates a network of libertarian think tanks that have sought to shunt the political agenda to the right in the UK and the US. Of course, there are left-leaning think tanks too, but, as Geoghegan notes, they are generally more transparent about their funding, as they rely on public money and donations from trusts.Anonymous funding makes think tanks the ideal vehicle for business interests to influence government policy beneath the radar. Geoghegan shows how a ldquotiny group of American plutocrats invested billions in think tanks, universities and election campaigns over the last four decades. ldquoBefore this methodical and precisely targeted spending spree, libertarians had been largely thought of as cranks, he writes. ldquoAfterwards, the limited space within which policies are created and publicly discussed was filled with proposals that they wanted.The ldquogrande dame of libertarian think tanks is the Institute for Economic Affairsin London. Geoghegan reveals how the IEArsquos ldquosunny analysis about Brexit and unprecedented access to ministers helped determine the UK governmentrsquos course after the referendum. The IEA also worked to promote the idea of the Anglosphere in the UK ndash a union of English-speaking people as a bulwark against Brussels bureaucrats first mooted by Margaret Thatcher in .Democracy for Sale appears just as the UK government publishes its long-awaited report into alleged Russian interference in UK politics. Geoghegan touches on Russian influence in the UK and beyond, but the bulk of the dark money and misinformation that he documents sits much closer to home.ldquoHiding in plain sight is a phrase that recurs throughout this book. The ultimate source of the money donated to the DUP by the CRC in the run-up to the EU referendum was protected not by cloak-and-dagger Brexiteers but by Northern Irish legislation. Subsequent Electoral Commission inquiries into the donation proved toothless. ldquoThe system is broken, and nobody intends to fix it, transparency activist Tamasin Cave tells Geoghegan.In ldquothe digital Wild West, accountability is in even shorter supply. Geoghegan conjures a blizzard of examples of the disturbing ways in which digital campaigning can be used to undermine democratic mechanisms, from targeted messaging to voter suppression.In this shadowy world, truth is the first casualty. During the  general election campaign, the Conservative Party rebranded its Twitter account as FactcheckUK with no consequences. However, all the blame for the increasing role of unregulated digital campaigning in our politics cannot be laid at the door of right-wing parties. Barack Obama was one of the first to harness its power.Written in crisp, vivid prose, Democracy for Sale is a dense but compelling narrative that takes us from the backstreets of Washington DC to Viktor Orbagravenrsquos Hungary. Above all, it is a call to arms, and everyone who is concerned about our democracy should read it.While Geoghegan remains an optimist, he does not hide the scale or urgency of the challenge. ldquoLike the climate, democracy is fast reaching a tipping point, he warns."},{"url":null,"title":"food-chef-tom-kerridge-shares-passion-bbqs","story":"Barbecues at the ready because chef Tom Kerridge, holder of two Michelin stars, has a trove of summertime cooking treats to share.During the course of his new show, Tom Kerridge Barbecues - on the Food Network, the chef will be showing off some old and new recipes using charcoal, smoke and fire.He talks about his favourite dish from the series and why everyone - including professional chefs - are prone to barbecue disasters from time to time.How did this series come about \"I filmed with Food Network last year, a big series for the States, they gave me a call and said listen do you want to do something with barbecues... it was actually a really good, fun thing to do.

He saw it dferently, calling her interventions ldquointolerable.The Thatcher-Major tussle was something of an exception, with most past leaders taking care not to criticise from the sidelines. Yet the rules, as well as being unwritten, are fluid.

The Government is just saying, We hope that employers co-operate. I hope I win the lottery on Saturday but that doesnt mean it is going to happen.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, was a hasty addition to the line-up. On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

The latter seems unlikely given how busy he seems to be with the modestly titled Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. Its latest position paper, Learning to Live Alongside Covid-, was ostensibly the reason for his latest appearance.It was a wide-ranging interview covering everything from Russia and China to Scottish independence. You can read what he had to say in full where in the paper, but in summary: Boris Johnson was uselessScottish Labour had been uselessand current Labour leader Keir Starmer was proving usefulIt was fairly predictable stuff for the former Prime Minister, except for the end when Ridge asked why he could not seem to wrench himself away from politics. Isnrsquot it time to take a break, she wondered, go round the golf course or to the shepherdrsquos hut  David Cameron famously opted for the latter, spending a cool pound, on one for his Cotswolds garden.Mr Blair seemed momentarily taken aback. ldquoItrsquos not something I want to do.

With more than one million Scots having been furloughed and think tanks making dire economic forecasts for the retail, hospitality, and tourism sector, the reality is more likely to be a tsunami of redundancies once the UK Government pulls the plug on its financial support schemes. The bounce back, as they say in stock markets, may be more like a dead cat bouncing.It would, therefore, be premature for the Scottish Government to even begin thinking about repealing the emergency measures introduced at the beginning of this crisis to help Scots struggling financially with this crisis.This includes the measures that were taken to extend protection for people from Sherf Officers from  days to six months, when they used Scotlandrsquos statutory moratorium procedure for debt. It also includes the decision to require landlords to give six monthsrsquo notice before initiating court action for rent arrears and includes the steps to waive bankruptcy application fees for those in most need.However, unless the Scottish Government acts, all these measures will be repealed on the th September , when the sunset clause for the CoronavirusActs No  and No  come into effect.To allow this to occur now would be financially calamitous for many. As we have seen from previous economic downturns, financial fallout is often a lagging effect of an economic crises and often comes later: not when the events leading to it occur. This will particularly be the case with this one.The last thing the Scottish Government should be doing now is pulling away the safety net from those people it was intended to help.In fact, there is a stronger case to be made that this is the time to strengthen that net and even extend its reach to provide greater protection for those most vulnerable.Already the UKrsquos large debt and homelessness charities, such as Shelter and Citizen Advice are lobbying the UK Government to take further steps to protect tenants and the UK Government has now laid regulations for their own debt Breathing Space Schemes in England and Wales, which will commence next year. Both of which are far more reaching than anything we have in Scotland.They not only protect people from bailfs but freeze interest and charges on debts and prevent evictions and repossessions. They also include specic measures to help those struggling with a mental health crisisthey are receiving help from mental health professionals. In Scotland we have no such comparative measures.It may well be, that even in those areas where the Scottish Parliament has the power to make a dference, the UK Government may now go further in introducing protections for the most vulnerable.We can only hope that the Scottish Government now focus on the financial fallout from this crisis and use the full powers of the Parliament to not repeal the measures they introduced, but extend them to March , and introduce more permanent measures in their place.If it does not, it is not legal powers they lack, but political will.Alan McIntosh is a money adviser.

Irsquod just learnt that ldquothe most blatant example of dark money in recent electoral politics can be traced to the south Glasgow suburb of Clarkston.The poundk-plus that the Democratic Unionist Partyspent on pro-Brexit advertising in the run up to the June  referendum on the UKrsquos membership of the European Union ndash not in Northern Ireland but Great Britain ndash was donated by an obscure body named the Constitutional Research Council . Its only named director was Richard Cook, a multiply-failed Tory candidate of Clarkston parish.This incident is totemic of the tawdry tale of secretive donors and anonymous propaganda that Geoghegan, investigations editor at independent media  openDemocracy and founder of the award-winning investigative website The Ferret, painstakingly weaves in Democracy for Sale. There are a few diamond mines and Russian ambassadors, itrsquos true, but in the main this story unfolds in unstimulating locales and features compromised mediocrities such as Cook.His business interests are nearly as convoluted as those of Arron Banks, one of the self-proclaimed ldquoBad Boys of Brexit. Drawing on the resources of a miasma of offshore companies, Banks bankrolled the belligerent, anti-immigration Leave.EU campaign with the ldquobiggest donation in British political history.The National Crime Agency investigated Banksrsquo pound.m donation to anti-EU causes amid mounting speculation about the source of the funds, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. Banks hailed the ruling as vindication of his Brexit campaign, but others saw it as ldquotacit acceptance that companies in offshore jurisdictions could underwrite political donations.The campaign for Brexit mingled such offshore money with obscure onshore funding. The CRCrsquos donation to the DUP encapsulates the problem. The CRC is an unincorporated association, not subject to the normal disclosure requirements that an incorporated company must meet. According to Geoghegan, unincorporated associations are ldquoblack boxes that can be set up for the sole purpose of funnelling money to political campaigns, with little or no transparency.The influential European Research Groupis also an unincorporated association. Geoghegan shows how the ERG, a party within a party that ldquobrought down a Conservative prime minister and called the tune on Brexit, was able to trouser around pound, in taxpayer money between  and  ldquothanks to a little-used Westminster convention. Another scream moment.The tale of how dark money reshaped the political agenda in the UK and beyond pullulates with such dim-lit legal entities. The same people and companies ndash Cambridge Analytica, Dominic Cummings, Nigel Farage ndash keep reappearing from the mists of an opaque complex of vested interests.Geoghegan claries that he does not believe Brexit was ldquosome grand conspiracy. The British state and the political and business establishment were behind Remain. Instead, he says, the referendum and its aftermath reveal something more fundamental and systemic: ldquoa broken political system that is ripe for exploitation.Arguably, the groundwork for Brexit ndash and for Donald Trump and Boris Johnsonrsquos victories at the ballot box ndash was laid by another brand of unaccountable entity: the think tank. In theory, think tanks do research and publish research papers in practice, says Geoghegan, ldquoWords like lsquoinstitutersquo and lsquocentrersquo give an appearance of academic rigour to what is essentially paid-for lobbying.In the book, Geoghegan illuminates a network of libertarian think tanks that have sought to shunt the political agenda to the right in the UK and the US. Of course, there are left-leaning think tanks too, but, as Geoghegan notes, they are generally more transparent about their funding, as they rely on public money and donations from trusts.Anonymous funding makes think tanks the ideal vehicle for business interests to influence government policy beneath the radar. Geoghegan shows how a ldquotiny group of American plutocrats invested billions in think tanks, universities and election campaigns over the last four decades. ldquoBefore this methodical and precisely targeted spending spree, libertarians had been largely thought of as cranks, he writes. ldquoAfterwards, the limited space within which policies are created and publicly discussed was filled with proposals that they wanted.The ldquogrande dame of libertarian think tanks is the Institute for Economic Affairsin London. Geoghegan reveals how the IEArsquos ldquosunny analysis about Brexit and unprecedented access to ministers helped determine the UK governmentrsquos course after the referendum. The IEA also worked to promote the idea of the Anglosphere in the UK ndash a union of English-speaking people as a bulwark against Brussels bureaucrats first mooted by Margaret Thatcher in .Democracy for Sale appears just as the UK government publishes its long-awaited report into alleged Russian interference in UK politics. Geoghegan touches on Russian influence in the UK and beyond, but the bulk of the dark money and misinformation that he documents sits much closer to home.ldquoHiding in plain sight is a phrase that recurs throughout this book. The ultimate source of the money donated to the DUP by the CRC in the run-up to the EU referendum was protected not by cloak-and-dagger Brexiteers but by Northern Irish legislation. Subsequent Electoral Commission inquiries into the donation proved toothless. ldquoThe system is broken, and nobody intends to fix it, transparency activist Tamasin Cave tells Geoghegan.In ldquothe digital Wild West, accountability is in even shorter supply. Geoghegan conjures a blizzard of examples of the disturbing ways in which digital campaigning can be used to undermine democratic mechanisms, from targeted messaging to voter suppression.In this shadowy world, truth is the first casualty. During the  general election campaign, the Conservative Party rebranded its Twitter account as FactcheckUK with no consequences. However, all the blame for the increasing role of unregulated digital campaigning in our politics cannot be laid at the door of right-wing parties. Barack Obama was one of the first to harness its power.Written in crisp, vivid prose, Democracy for Sale is a dense but compelling narrative that takes us from the backstreets of Washington DC to Viktor Orbagravenrsquos Hungary. Above all, it is a call to arms, and everyone who is concerned about our democracy should read it.While Geoghegan remains an optimist, he does not hide the scale or urgency of the challenge. ldquoLike the climate, democracy is fast reaching a tipping point, he warns."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-twitter-spotlight","story":"Twitter The micro-blogging and social networking service, where users post \"tweets\", began in  and surged in popularity, with , tweets posted per quarter of  rising to  million per quarter in .Now It has around  million monthly active users and each second, on average, around , tweets are posted on Twitter, which works out at more than , tweets sent per minute,  million tweets per day and around  billion tweets per year.The stars The most popular Twitter account is Barack Obamas with  million followers, while Justin Bieber has  million, Katy Perry  million, Rihanna  million and Taylor Swt  million.

In Edinburgh, the accused is behind a sheet of glass and the camera is on the other side so the sound quality isnrsquot great on the video link.

This included: pregnant women: being put on sick pay rather than being furloughed, which affected their statutory maternity benefit entitlement being made redundant before going on maternity leave and being pressurised into working in unsafe working environments.

now has a \"clear timetable\" to prepare and submit a full nomination to UNESCO, who will then determine whether or not The Flow Country meets the criteria for World Heritage Site status.The designationis given toareas judged to be of \"outstanding universal value\".Natural Environment Minister, Mairi Gougeon MSP said: ldquoScotlandrsquos inspiring natural environment creates a powerful sense of belonging which helps define us as a nation. I visited this amazing peatland myself last year and saw the local communityrsquos support for the World Heritage Site application, so I want to congratulate the Peatlands Partnership on their success to date and wish them well in their future nomination to UNESCO.\"This is indeed great news not just for Caithness and Sutherland but for all of Scotland. The Flow Country will be a great addition to the global list of World Heritage Sites. Not only will this be Scotlandrsquos first purely lsquonaturalrsquo World Heritage Site but its inscription will also recognise the important role peatlands play in tackling the twin challenges of climate change and bioersity loss.The ,-acreexpanse of the Flow Country, more than twice the size of Orkney, includes peatbog, lochs and bog pools.:Scientic knowledge to rise from ashes of Flow Country fireIt is Europersquos biggest blanket bog and regarded as the best example of its kind in the world.Up to  metresdeep, it holds an estimated  million tonnes of carbon, nearly twice as much as all the forests and woodlands in Great Britain.Peatland Partnershiprsquos Flow Country WHS Working Group chairman Frances Gunn said of the development: ldquoThis is wonderful news for the north, especially at these dficult times when good news stories are few and far between. Itrsquos all really exciting and has taken such a great effort from everyone to get through to this stage.\"Whilst therersquos still a lot of work to do, I am sure that a World Heritage Site will bring many benefits and help boost our fragile economy once wersquove re-opened for business after the current pandemic.The soggy terrain does not just have environmental value, it provides fresh water for streams that are home to otters and spawning salmon.The bog attracts common scoter ducks ndash one of the few places they are found ndash while red-throated, black-throated ers, golden plover and greenshank come to nest. Raptors such as merlin, short-eared owls and golden eagles hunt over the moss and in its pools, frogs, snakes, shrews and dozens of species of insects thrive.Nicola Sinclair, chairman of Highland Councilrsquos Caithness committee, said: ldquoThis is a tremendous opportunity to acknowledge the value of the Flow Country and secure the wider recognition that it deserves.\"For those of us who live and work in Caithness and Sutherland, the Flow Country is a special part of our place, our history. Irsquom confident that not only can we secure World Heritage status, but that we can do so in a way that brings benefits to both the habitat and surrounding communities, for our future.The Flow Country World Heritage Site Working Group have been working toconvince the UKGovernmentthat the Flow Country is the best of the candidate sites that wereon a tentative list to qualyfor consideration as World Heritage sites. But it accepted last year that it couldtake a further two years before it will be accepted by UNESCO.Geologyrock star Professor Iain Stewart was one of those who had thrown theirweight behind the World Heritage Site bid.The BBC presenter and Scots geologist joined those who believed the World Heritage Site designation would provide \"legacy\" protection to ensure current efforts to protect peatland all overScotlandare not ruined.Scottish Natural Heritage chief executive Francesca Osowska, also welcomed the latest announcement saying: \"The many benefits a World Heritage Site would bring to the Highlands could play a key role in the green economic recovery we will all be striving for as we emerge from the COVID- pandemic.\"It is felt that the designation will help to protect peatland restoration work. The Scottish government said last year it would put an extra poundm in funding to restore degraded areas of peatland in addition to the poundm awarded.Anne McCall, director of RSPB Scotland added: \"I know everyone involved in the application has worked so hard, and the Partnership should be very proud of their achievement."},{"url":null,"title":"scotrail-run-90-normal-services-next-week","story":"The train operator will run % of normal services from August , compared to the current level of %.Demand is expected to increase ahead of schools ing in Scotland on August .Driver training has been suspended as it requires two people to sit in the cabin at the same time.:Big changes on ScotRail trains from tomorrow mdash what you need to knowAs a result, certain services will remain suspended.Commuters are still being urged to consider other travel options including walking and cycling to free up space for those who must use the train.Face coverings are mandatory at stations and on trains, and anyone who feels ill or has a temperature should not travel.David Simpson, ScotRail operations director, said: \"Thanks to the hard work of staff across Scotlands railway, well operate as close to a normal timetable as possible from Monday August .\"Like businesses across the world, we continue to face challenges caused by coronavirus but we will have every available train in service from August .\"We do need everybody to continue taking personal responsibility for their travel choices because physical distancing cant be guaranteed.:Nine out of ten Scottish passengers satisfied with ScotRail service\"Customers who do travel with ScotRail should follow our five rules for safer travel, including the wearing of a face covering on trains and at stations.\""},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-people-scotland-can-take-part-covid-19-vaccine-trial","story":"Speaking at the Scottish Governments daily briefing yesterday,Deputy chief medical officer Nicola Steedman asked members of the public to consider whether they could volunteer during the testing phase of the drug.Last week, findings from the early phases of a vaccine being created by Oxford University were published, with Ms Steedman saying the vaccine was both safe and created a ldquogood response in the more than  test subjects.She added: ldquoItrsquos still early days, but itrsquos definitely good news.Ms Steedman said: ldquoScience and research has never been more important than it is now.Larger-scale trials will be required to ensure that vaccines can be rigorously tested in the coming months and Ms Steedman has said a registry has been set up across the UK for people to sign up to be a part of Covid- trials.Ms Steedman said, adding: ldquoPlease do visit the online siteyou can and think about whether you, like so many others, can volunteer to help with vaccine trials.Online sign-up can be found at www.nhs.uk researchcontactIf you are interested in volunteering for #COVID vaccine studies, you can register and find out more at https:t.co ZYZzEbI https:t.co WhQfkZSsThe First Minister confirmedanother four positive cases of the virusin Scotland, bringing the total to ,.No deaths have been recorded in the last  hours, meaning the total number of fatalities remains at .But NicolaSturgeon said the Scottish Government is likely to adopt a ldquocautious approach to lockdown easing when its planned review takes place on Thursday.She warned there is a ldquoworrying resurgence of Covid cases globally and stressed the hospitality sector in Scotland must ensure it is adhering to guidelines put in place."},{"url":null,"title":"cineworld-provide-update-customers-scotland---unlimited-card-holders-set-enjoy-price-decrease","story":"While Cineworld cinemas in Scotland have not yet reopened, the company also informed customers that there will be a reduction in pricefor Unlimited Card holders.In an email sent to customers, they wrote: \"Our main priority remains the safety of our customers and staff.

Help us to fight for the freedom and equality of all Scots.\"The latest unattributed blog on the partys website statesthatboth the Labour Party and the SNP had in recent times made the independence a \"taboo subject\",And it claims that the independence supporter is \"politically homeless, without a voice and without a leader\".\"The conventional understanding of how independence would be achieved was based on the  devolution deal, where it would only happenboth Labour and the SNP endorsed it,\" it said. \"That is the basis on which Labour for Independence operates to build up support within the Labour movement until it finds its way to the top and it becomes accepted policy.\"Well, itrsquos not going to happen. The Labour party, like the SNP has been quietly taken over and placemen put in who will not frighten the horses at Westminster. Independence is never going to make it onto that conference motion. Itrsquos time for all independence supporters to face the hard truth thatwe wish to see freedom for Scotland in our letime, we need to break away from the mainstream and form a third force to push for it.\"That, in short is why Scotland needs the ISP. We got fed up wandering in the wilderness. We got fed up with the mandates and vows and the empty promises and the Bullingdon club in Westminster. The ISP picked a spot, threw up a shack and called it home. We joined them. And itrsquos home for you as well,you support self government and want to push things forward.\"It comes as a leading polling experts said that internal isions in the SNP could pose the ldquobiggest risk to the party securing Scottish independence.Strathclyde Universityrsquos Professor Sir John Curtice said lingering disagreements over what to dothe UK Government continues to reject a second referendum could prevent the party from the ldquorealisation of their ambitions.Sir John believes the the nationalist movement in Scotland being ldquoeffectively organised by one party has provided an advantage over the ldquofragmented unionist side, which he said had been a ldquofundamental weakness of the No campaign in .Support for Scottish independence has surged during lockdown and one poll earlier this month predicted SNP are heading for a landslide victory at next yearrsquos Holyrood election.The survey, by polling agency Panelbase found % of backed the country going independent, almost turning on its head the - result of rsquos referendum on the issue.The ISP blog went on: \"This hasnrsquot been easy for any of us. Many of us were involved in other parties and deeply involved at that. Itrsquos been dficult and hurtful and wersquove been accused of betrayal and political naivety. But we have persisted, because of the state our country is in.\"None of us expected to be doing this a year ago. Yet we are doing it, because right now our country is going up in flames and instead of uniting to put the fire out, we are arguing about which bucket we should use to tackle the fire. Not only that, but we are waiting for permission from those who set the fire, to allow us to put it out.\"These are extraordinary times. Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures. Political parties, political movements, wax and wane. Twelve short years ago, Labour was the power in Scotland. For now, it is the SNP. Parties change and loyalties change.\"But the impulses that initially drove those movements remain the same that everyone has dignity as a human being, that no one should be left poor or homeless or in need. After ten years of austerity where the only growth industry has been food banks, this should be burned like a brand on the heart of any decent person.\"Will you join us  Will you put aside the old politics and walk with us as we try to take our country back  Some may see it as betrayal but it is not.

According to NHS Orkney#s interim chief executive, Michael Dickson, this is because the new positive test was conducted by an industrial lab which had not been validated by the NHS.The inidual, who is not currently in Orkney — but has been in the county during the past week — has been asked to self-isolated. This person will be immediately re-tested by the nearest NHS veried lab — the Lighthouse Lab in Glasgow.  In the meantime, NHS Orkney will be tracing iniduals that the person in question has come into signicant contact with.It should be confirmed within the next three days whether this is indeed a new test-positive case — the tenth for Orkney,so.Mr Dickson said: #A number of industries use labs to undertake COVID swab tests and this labs are not validated by the NHS.#We can#t be confident that,the same test had been done in an NHS lab, it would have achieved the same result.#The interim chief executive, who is the permanent chief executive for NHS Shetland, explained that there had been a similar issue with a possible case within his home board. He added that, like in Shetland, he would be working to see whether some industries which have been testing their staff for the virus could do so through an NHS veried lab.#What we do is presume the person is positive,# Mr Dickson continued.#We kick in all the our well-rehearsed contact-tracing mechanisms and we instruct the person to self-isolate where they are.#When this happened in Shetland, the second test came back negative. It#s dficult, but we have to err by the side of caution.#Mr Dickson said that he understood that there would be an element of anxiety around this new possible case, and advised that all those who have come into signicant contact with the inidual in question will be contacted and asked to self-isolate for  days. If a contact is in a high risk category, a decision may be taken to immediately test them for coronavirus.#If you do not receive a call from our contact tracing team, then basically you#ve not been in signicant contact with this inidual,# the interim chief executive said.It is not knownthis case will be included in NHS Orkney’s positive COVID cases as the original lab is not an NHS facility.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

By Richard WilliamsJuly   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailIf you have already travelled to Spain prior to Saturday, the UK Government#s advice is that you should continue your holiday andhome as planned. However, we would encourage these holidaymakers to proactively contact their travel insurance provider to see what cover they will receive while they remain on holiday.Holidaymakers in Spain, who wish to change their travel plans andto Northern Ireland earlier than planned, should immediately speak with their airline provider, tour operator or travel agent to see what options are available.Holidaymakers who are yet to travel to Spain should think very carefully about travelling, as most travel insurance policies will now be invalid due to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’supdated advice.Since Monday, the Balearic and Canary Islands have also been added to the list of areas where all non-essential travel should be avoided, so the same applies.You are entitled to a full refundyour airline cancels your flight.However, despite the FCO’s advice, many airlines are still flying to Spain, andthis is the case you are not entitled to a refund — but most airlines are allowing passengers to rebook without a fee, or offering vouchers for future travel instead.Therefore we would encourage all passengers to contact their airline to discuss the options that are available to them.Overall, your travel rights depend on whether you have booked flights, or whether you have booked a package holiday.For package holidays, the Package Travel Regulations  entitle you to a refundthe holiday cannot go ahead as planned.Holidaymakers need to be cautious about booking future travel abroad.The FCO’s recent change in travel advice has shown that things can change rapidly.Passengers need to think what will happen to them, or their money,they cannot, or do not want to travel.Consumers requiring further help or advice can contact The Consumer Council on Freephone    or email contact@consumercouncil.org.uk.You can also visit The Consumer Council’s dedicated webpage for travel affected by COVID- at www.consumercouncil.org.uk coronavirus.Richard Williams is head of transport policy at The Consumer Council  Belfast   Related Content and Edith Mikutenaite, who live in Newtownabbey, leave Belfast International Airport after arriving from Barcelona yesterday\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   and Edith Mikutenaite, who live in Newtownabbey, leave Belfast International Airport after arriving from Barcelona yesterday\"Coronavirus PremiumPain in Spain for local travel firms sparks call for bailoutThe Chancellor has been urged to consider introducing financial support for the travel industry here after Spain was suddenly dropped off the air bridge safe list.Most ReadBelfast nightclub owner left with £ in bank account pleads for Stormont#s helpRevealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeThree dead from same family: Kilrea husband, we and brother victims of horric crash‘Pure evil and monstrous’ X Factor flop jailed for le for a series of sex attacksJim Wells defends comments labeling GAA #sectarian and republican# ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Wells, who has had the DUP party whip removed, made the comments during a debate in the Assembly. The GAA rejected his criticism.Defending the remarks on BBC Radio Ulster#s Nolan Show on Tuesday morning, Mr Wells referred to comments made by DUP MLA Edwin Poots while he was the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure in , claiming that the GAA was a cold house for the unionist community.Here we are  years later and there still has been no progress made on making the GAA more inclusive to the whole community, Mr Wells told the Nolan Show. It is .% nationalist.He added: If soccer or rugby was entirely Protestant or Catholic there would be huge questions asked about why vast amounts of public money is being poured into an organisation that has failed to attract people from the other side of the fence as it where. Similar the GAA has done nothing in my opinion to make itself more inclusive and friendly to the Protestant community.They haven#t moved on at all.Mr Wells made the remarks during a debate bout the Executive CommitteeBill on Monday. Critics of the bill say it will reduce areas in which ministers# power is constrained by the Executive as a whole.Mr Wells used the planning decision on Casement Park as an example of how a minister could go on a solo run.Mr Wells told MLAs: Say Sinn Fein decided to spend a vast amount of money, as it could, holding the Department for Communities, on making Casement Park even grander.

They have been delivering food parcels and delivering pharmaceuticals to our most vulnerable in our communities, he said.I am quite certain we were not asking people their religion or political persuasion before we were knocking on their doors. On this coming Friday, in Croke Park, we have the Muslim festival of Eid taking place. Because of restricted numbers and restricted venues, they have chosen Croke Park to hold this, so I think that shows that we are certainly not sectarian. Sinn Fein#s South Down MLA Sinead Ennis called on Mr Wells to retract his comments as the GAA could not be further from that. Following the debate, SDLP MLA Justin McNulty, a former All-Ireland winner, said there were hundreds of people in GAA clubs across Ireland who have done more to reconcile communities and bring people together than Mr Wells.It is incredibly disappointing that he continues to use isive, offensive language to label our community of volunteers who are working hard, including throughout the pandemic, to support people, he added.Read More DUP#s Gregory Campbell accused of mocking Irish language after #crass and despicable# social media postMeanwhile, the DUP have been challenged to act on comments by DUP MP Gregory Campbell mocking the Irish language.The East Londonderry MP made the remarks on his Facebook page on Sunday in relation to a BBC programme about a suspected Nazi spy who lived in Donegal during the Second World War.He said: I#m informed that BBC  NI had a programme on tonight about a suspected German spy who lived in the RoI during the war.

Throughout the crisis we have continued to draw down mortgages and are currently lending up to % loan to value.As a responsible lender we consider a range of factors to assess the affordability of the mortgage in the long-term. At this time we are not accepting mortgage applications from customers who are on furlough but we will keep this under review.Nationwide Building Society said it will consider applications from people who have been furloughed but added those on furlough are not eligible for the society#s recently launched % loan to value first-time buyer mortgages.Bank of Ireland said: We are lending to customers who are furloughed. We#ll ask customers to provide some information about the terms of the furlough during the application process.Lender AIB said: All our lending is based on the customer#s ability to repay. This is to protect the customer from undue risk. Applications are dealt with on a case by case basis.Ulster Bank said it was “strongly committed to lending to all kinds of mortgage borrowers - this includes those on furlough and those ing from furlough”.“As always, they base lending decisions on affordability and ability to repay and they take each case on an inidual basis.”A spokeswoman for Progressive Building Society said it is “a responsible lender and reviews and assesses every case on an inidual basis including the income and expenditure of all applicants”.HSBC said it will not lend to furloughed workers whoseto work date is further than three months away or there is nodate at all.Mortgage broker and advisor London  Country said: “Mortgage lenders have sought to support those on furlough through the lockdown period and in the main have continued to accept furloughed income when considering how much they can offer to borrowers. “That would of course often mean a reduced income and consequent reduction in the size of borrowing available but at least most lenders would be able to consider lending.  “As we move closer to the unwinding of the jobs retention scheme borrowers should expect to see more questions aboutto work and some lenders are now stipulating that they will want some confirmation. “Getting employer confirmation may not be possible for all at this stage but on the upside those that can, may be able to use theirto work income for the affordability assessment.  “That approach will be consistent whether for first time buyers or next time buyers as lenders will need to be able to demonstrate that the mortgage is affordable and will remain sustainable. “However the market is still light on deals for those with small deposits which is often a bigger issue for first time buyers and some of the lenders that have ed to the % LTV market will potentially set a higher expectation when it comes to credit score.”Belfast Most ReadBelfast nightclub owner left with £ in bank account pleads for Stormont#s helpRevealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeThree dead from same family: Kilrea husband, we and brother victims of horric crash‘Pure evil and monstrous’ X Factor flop jailed for le for a series of sex attacksJim Wells defends comments labeling GAA #sectarian and republican# ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The teenager#s body was discovered on August  beside a small stream about .km from the resort.Although her family believe there was a criminal element to what happened, police have said there was no sign the -year-old was abducted or raped.A preliminary post-mortem examination showed she succumbed to intestinal bleeding due to starvation and stress.An inquest into her death is due to begin on August  and last until September .Denis Barror, the Dublin-based solicitor acting for Meabh and her French father Sebastien, declined to comment on the proceedings.Ms Brennan denied defaming the couple and said she was surprised that they were taking a case. I will be defending myself. I don#t believe they have a cause of action against me, she said.Ms Brennan said that while she wrote very extreme things on the social media , she believed them to be true. Facebook declined to comment.Ms Brennan is a former partner in a Dublin law firm, and specialised in employment and equality law. She retired in  due to an illness.She confirmed her Facebook account was suspended for  days last September but was reinstated and remains active.The case is the second set of proceedings initiated by the Quoirin family since the tragedy occurred. They are also suing the owner of the resort for alleged negligence.Confirming details of that case last January, Sankara Nair, a lawyer for Nora#s parents, said the family strongly believed she was abducted as she had mental and physical disabilities and could not have wandered off on her own.The lawsuit alleges a cottage window was found ajar, with its latch broken, on the morning she disappeared.It is also claimed the resort gate was left open without any security and there was no surveillance camera except for the reception area.According to the claim, Nora had poor motor skills and needed help to walk. Although in her mid-teens, her mental age was about five or six years.Mr Sankara said the resort was not safe for Nora and that anybody could have come in and taken her. In an interview with RTE News last December, Meabh and Sebastian Quoirin said they were determined to get truth and justice.I think we will seek justice in so far as we can. We have to find peace in our own hearts, said Meabh Quoirin.We will carry Nora with us forever. She#s with us here every day. I talk to her every day. She holds my hand. We hear her.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, the Department for Communitieswill undertake a ‘full marketing’ exercise in the months ahead and said it will decide on the ‘most appropriate’ project to regenerate the site. Last February, the Trust entered a twelve-month agreement with site owner the DfC to enable the Trust to further develop the proposal of locating a new Cityside Health and Care Centre at Fort George. During that time no further marketing of Fort George took place.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry Central Library in Foyle Street is one of just five libraries from across the North which were chosen to be part of a pilot scheme to allow customers back in. Branch Library Manager, Koran Burns, said people were delighted toto the facility, which shut on March .

Unfortunately, we have had to take out a lot of seating to allow for social distancing, but this is something we will continue to look at.

We have had a steady stream of visitors at the Central Library since it reopened and people have told us they feel very safe due to all the measures we have introduced. Staff are there to greet people as they come in the door and we have provided hand sanitiser. There are also screens at the desks and lots of customer signage. Any books that are ed will be stored for  hours before they are put back on the shelves. Customers are being asked to keep a social distance and limit their time on the computers or browsing for books to half an hour. There are also self service machines for borrowing books. In addition, all surfaces in the library will be regularly cleaned. We are asking customers to help us keep the computer stations clean by providing sanitising wipes to wipe them down before and after they use them, said Mrs Craig. Staff will also be carrying out a high level of cleaning in the library. Mrs Craig said the opening hours have also been changed to allow the library to close for  hoursbefore reopening on a Tuesday morning for vulnerable people.

Customers can phone their local library during dedicated hours to request books and then arrange a suitable time for a contactless collection, explained Mrs Craig. A customer can view our online catalogue and checka particular book they are interested in is available in their local library, they will then phone and speak with a member of staff who will set it aside and arrange a day and time for them to come in and collect it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking to the County Derry Post, as part of the in-depth look at Ulster hurling, both referred to the competition being at its peak during the nineties when Down and Derry were challenging for titles. McCann, who expressed that Antrim would not have any aspirations of being part of the talked about Team Ulster concept, said the Saffrons would be mad keen for aof the Ulster senior hurling championship. The Creggan man is one of two or three to have ever played in the Ulster championship, but feels there would need to be a reward and spoke of how the automatic entry to the All-Ireland semi-finals now being a thing of the past. googletag.cmd.push “Id say we would be mad keen to get it back,” McCann said. “If there was some sort of reward for winning the Ulster championship, you would get a better buy-in from all the teams and when they removed that, it was a road to nowhere.” Down manager Sheehan had a dferent opinion on the need for qualication into the Liam McCarthy Cup to make the Ulster championshipviable. It would be a massive incentive, but felt that Derry and Down would not be at the level of Leinster or Munster and the Joe McDonagh Cup would be their level. googletag.cmd.push McCann felt that the new tiered championship has been really good for Antrim. Last years Joe McDonagh Cup threw up competitive games and their clash with Offaly was among the best games he has seen, but not enough were able to witness it.  Antrim senior hurling captain Conor McCann “It is a shame they are never on TV, the GAA never listen and never do anything about it. They show the odd game and I have no doubt the Christy Ring is the exact same. If the promotion was better, it would definitely help,” McCann stated. Sheehan said he would love to see aof the Ulster championship and its absence reflected poorly on the province. While he accepts Antrim would general win it, he points to Derry winning the last U final and beating Down in the final. “The reality is, an Ulster championship medal means something to people andAntrim felt they didnt want to partake in it, Derry, Down Armagh and the other teams would have an interest in playing in it...but clearly you want Antrim in it,” Sheehan said. The Newry Shamrocks man looked towards Derry or Down being in Division A next season and Antrims chance to be in Division , should they beat Kerry. “That a good for Ulster hurling. It is indicative of the fact there are good hurlers in the province and there are guys in the province who are passionate about it,” he added. Sheehan also mentioned the topic of dual counties trying to attract players to the hurling . “It is very hard to do that, when those lads can get provincial recognition playing in a provincial championship and get on the TV. Their chances of getting some kind of coverage is increased, yet we dont even have our own championship at any level – senior, minor or U. “I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” Sheehan adds. He also indicated how Derry and Down would love to get a crack at an Ulster title. References were made to the crowds at Slaughtneils recent games with Dunloy and Ballyhale. “We are being denied the opportunity to have a show-piece for Ulster hurling and I just think that is wrong. It is the very minimum the Ulster Council should be doing,” the Down boss pleaded. So when do you play it  “Fixtures is something you can always work your way around,” said Sheehan, who was the GPAs representative on the National Fixtures Committee setup by President John Horan last year. “Ideally, you would like to see it played in the summer. I dont know why, with the right kind of work, at the very least the first step could be taken where they could look to morph the McGurk Cup into the Ulster championship. “If we are playing in a pre-season competition, there is no reason why that cant be built up on. Either make it an Ulster championship or mirror it and give people summer hurling.” He doesnt buy into the scenario of clubs clashing with county in the summer. Sheehans solution is train with the county once a week. Give them back to their clubs but still play in the Ulster championship. “Nobody pays the players wages so no manager, club or county, should have exclusive rights to players,” Sheehan stressed. “Players want to be playing matches and managers shouldnt be stopping them from doing that.” Conor McCann agreed on a summer slot for the Ulster hurling championship, but it demanded more respect. “It should be having more of a stature, other things should be moving out of the way for it,” he stated. “We shouldnt be talking about squeezing the Ulster hurling championship in. You dont hear people talking about squeezing the Munster championship into the fixtures, do you ”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bellaghy and Loups game will be followed by the Round  clash of Glen and Magherafelt, a repeat of last seasons decider. googletag.cmd.push As an alternative to the full package, live games can be purchased inidually for a cost of pound. Our Championships in Derry are perennially among the most competitive anywhere in Ireland and our games regularly attract supporters from other counties across Ulster,” commented Derry GAA Chairman Stephen Barker. He felt it was important to maximise access to the club championship during the Covid- crisis. Social distancing will limit the attendance and other vulnerable members of the community, who may be shielding, will not be in a position to attend games. Our hurling and football championships are part of the rhythm of summer and autumn. Thanks to our new streaming service, supporters will still be able to see every important pass, block, point and goal that happens in Derry this summer. “Streaming of live matches is a hot topic at present so the uptake for the upcoming set of games will determine whether or not it has a future for our club championships,” Barker added. As a special introductory offer, a nine-month subscription will cost pound, normally pound per month.

Summer is here and the United Kingdom is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much-needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. googletag.cmd.push Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation. But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines. Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months. “They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry. “All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. “But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.” Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps. When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book. Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem. Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.  LUXURY STAY: Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey at the Merchant Hotel Relax in five-star luxury Social distancing measures aren’t the only change visitors are experiencing at Belfast’s five-star Merchant Hotel. The hotel has used lockdown time to complete its pound, investment of the Great Room Restaurant and Cocktail Bar. The management team is confident that customers will benefit from, but not be inconvenienced by, the Covid- compliant changes it has also made. The Great Room has been reimagined to create a standalone restaurant and the Cocktail Bar has also benefited from signicant refurbishment. Other venues within the Beannchor Group portfolio have also opened their doors. Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey said: “We’re aware that customers and guests may be curious about the experience that awaits them and, while there are measures in place that follow the scientic guidelines and industry best practice to ensure the safety of our staff and customers at all times, we have striven to minimise the impact to the overall experience at all our venues.” Camping perfect for keeping distance Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond. Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular. middot Wales is open for camping from  July.  Courtesy of Cool Camping Extra measures in place so you can embark on a lakeside holiday Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures. They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner. “There are a lot of positive health implications of being outside and on the water.”  LOCH LOMOND: Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened self-catering properties and cruises For more information on staying safe, please go to www.discovernorthernireland. _CoronavirusPHutm_mediumdisplayutm_sourceMediaForceutm_contentxframingdclidCOvM_IeoCFQzwQodkcEARw\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener\" --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Local playwright Brian Foster recently decided to write a poem about the city, following the positive response when he penned a poem about Creggan where he grew up. .However, he wanted to give people an opportunity to help him write the Derry poem. He started the ball rolling by putting the first line of the poem on to the Memories of Creggan Facebook. He then asked people to come up with ideas for the next line of the poem. Through this process, the poem, entitled My Derry Days, was created. googletag.cmd.push Mr Foster said he was delighted with the response to his initiative. “As far as I’m aware, this is the first time a poem has been written in this online manner by any community anywhere in Ireland. Perhaps even further afield,” he said. “The standard of the entries was so high that the hardest bit was selecting the winning line each night from so many brilliant efforts.” Read more about this story and the finished poem in todays Derry News. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Both Irish Cuip semi-finals – Coleraine vs. Ballymena and Cltonville vs. Glentoran - will be played today at Windsor Park, with the final to be played this Friday.But all such talk of red ribbons on the cup is premature for McLaughlin, who is refusing to look beyond the challenge posed by Mick McDermotts Glens today.“We havent really spoken at all about the final,” McLaughlin stated.“I do know how long its been since the club has won the cup and its crazy to think its been that long because we have had so many great sides down the years. We havent even had that conversation with the players because the sole focus is on Monday.“It will be a really tough game against a good side in Glentoran. Mick McDermott has done a really great job with them and he has them playing well, so it sets it up for a good game, an exciting game. Its a game that we feel we can win, but Im sure Glentoran will be saying the same.” googletag.cmd.push Derry interestThere is a real Derry interest in the last four of the competition this year. With Conor McDermott and Michael McCrudden hoping to help McLaughlin to the trophy this weekend, Glentorans Patrick McClean will have other ideas.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history. We will not let this happen..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"MoT centres open  ","story":"DRIVERS across the district are heading back to Downpatrickrsquos MoT centre this month.The Driver and Vehicle Agencyhas begun a phasedof MoT tests, with driving tests also set to resume.MoT tests for what are being described as ldquopriority vehicle groups began on Monday and testing for other vehicles is due to recommence in August.There are also plans to reinstate some driver testing services in July, but these will only be allowed to proceedthey can be done safely and social distancing requirements can be met.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon said ldquoofficials have been working hard to find solutions to help customers.Ms Mallon said the DVA has carried out ldquoa full review of risk assessments and developed new MoT processes that comply with all the published government public health advice and guidance.The minister continued: ldquoA number of measures have been put in place including a range of exemptions and extensions so that, as far as possible, vehicles can be kept on the road safely and most people can keep driving.ldquoCovid- has caused unprecedented dficulties for all of us and I thank our customers for their patience at this very challenging time.Ms Mallon also confirmed that new lts have been installed at  of the provincersquos test centres.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.

I fully understand, and support the need for language ersity.”Complaints have been made about the post to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards by Conradh na Gaeilge, an advocacy group for Irish language speakers, and a -year-old boy.Conradh na Gaeilge alleged the post is a breach of the House of Commons code of conduct, saying it was “offensive and insulting in nature to those who speak the Irish language”.In a complaint letter shared on Twitter, Adam Mac Giolla Easbuic, who attends an Irish Medium School in Dungiven – within Mr Campbell’s constituency – requested the commissioner investigates “racist undertones to both Germans and Irish speakers”.He wrote: “I find Mr Campbell’s comments extremely offensive and disrespectful.“It is clear that he learned nothing during the Acht na Gaeilge campaign for an Irish Language Act that me and all my friends took part in.“I don’t think his comments are suitable for an MP to make.“Thank you for taking the time to read my complaint. I hope that you will investigate this.”Disagreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein over an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland was a sticking point in political talks between the parties last year, ahead of the New Decade New Approach deal.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
