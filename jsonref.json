Jenny Stallard speaks to salon owner Melissa Timperley and pub chain boss Helen Charlesworth to find out how they’re keeping staff and customers safeMelissa Timperley is used to the demands of her clients as a salon owner. As a “treat” destination, she knows that everything – from the friendly welcome and the gown she puts around a customer’s shoulders, to the chocolate with their coffee – makes a visit to her eponymous hair salon a luxurious experience.And that isn’t changing just because of lockdown rules – in salons, restaurants, bars and shops, owners want their customers to feel special as they reopen in the “new normal”.Based in Manchester, Timperley’s three-floor salon recently had a makeover of its own, becoming a place of tape measures and screens, with every area considered for adaptation, from the reception desk to the basins, as it prepared to reopen.“I think salon owners have two really important jobs,” says Timperley. “They have, first and foremost, to keep their staff healthy and happy, and then they’ve got the job of keeping every single client healthy and happy.”Her first step was to see what other countries had been doing, in advance of any UK guidance. “The whole of lockdown has been a rollercoaster of emotions for most people, you have great days and bad days, and things get overwhelming. We researched what a lot of other countries were doing before our guidelines even came out,” says Timperley.Then, when the UK government did announce its own rules, specifically for England, it was a case of acting swiftly and safely to make some key decisions that worked for customers and staff. As the online appointment book filled up, she worked hard to make the salon accessible while still keeping that luxury feel.For Timperley, that has meant installing hand sanitiser stations and ordering new gowns. There will be branded face masks for those who want to wear them, although customers are not obliged to since staff will wear visors.There’s a huge emphasis on loyalty in the industry, where customers have been patient while they wait for news of appointments, and salon owners like Timperley want to show that’s appreciated, while also making sure her staff feel safe, too.“You’ve got to show that you’re doing the best for everybody. That means buying the best equipment, not cutting any corners,” she says. “We’ve staggered the appointments, we’re opening longer hours and we’re even opening on a Sunday to be able to service all our regular clients who’ve waited for us.”When the UK government announced that non-essential businesses in England could reopen on 4 July, many people were more than ready for a hair appointment, which shows the impact of not having these services around.Different salons needed to adapt in different ways. At Melissa Timperley, there is no “sharing” of clients, but at other salons that’s often not the case. For example, you may have visited a hairdresser and had your hair washed by one assistant, your cut done by your stylist and then the blow dry by another. Timperley’s salon has always been one-on-one with customers, which helped post-lockdown planning, as that needed to become the norm for all salons, according to UK government guidance.It’s a familiar scenario not just in salons but in pubs and restaurants across the country – wanting customers to feel valued and welcomed and staff to feel safe and appreciated, too – all while sticking to the guidelines laid out by the UK government.For Helen Charlesworth, managing director of the Stonegate pub company – which owns the Slug and Lettuce chain, among others – opening up has also been a “one day at a time” process. For the duration of lockdown, each day was one where she and the team planned for a future where they could reopen.Helping staff feel connected was a priority, she says, and a lot of time also went into ensuring the chain had a robust “closedown” manual. “We’ve never in our time had to close down an entire pub chain before. So we learned quite a lot, and we felt it would be good to document our learnings and have a precise manual. I’m glad we did as we’ve had to activate that in Leicester,” she adds, referring to the city that became subject to the UK’s first local lockdown on 30 June.The company furloughed a lot of team members, and then faced the task of ensuring their mental and physical health was kept in good shape. “We communicated with our people every day throughout the lockdown process, then once they went on to furlough we’ve had a very robust communication programme led by our CEO Simon Longbottom. He’s done twice weekly calls with the teams, video calls, kept everyone abreast of what’s going on.“We’ve had various groups raising money for charity. Lots of teams of people within Stonegate who have felt looked after and felt part of the Stonegate family have been out there raising cash for employees and families affected by Covid-19, the NHS and charities,” explains Charlesworth.Stonegate has an intranet hub where it could upload everything from key messages to quizzes and games. “Hundreds of different articles and things you can do whilst you’re off and we kept that updated,” adds Charlesworth.Keeping in touch with staff, both Charlesworth and Timperley agree, was key during lockdown so they felt valued and knew what was happening with the business.And what about the rules when the doors do open? Your haircut or that fancy G\u0026ampT will now come with a side serving of screens and socially-distanced chairs.“Customers don’t have to book a slot, but we are taking bookings in all our pubs, just so that people have got somewhere to come in and sit down and it’s easier because then we’re capturing customer data at the booking point,” says Charlesworth.“If you come to the pub and you haven’t booked, you’ll have to scan a QR code and put your details on to a website and we have to keep those details for 21 days,” she says.“The wonderful thing about hospitality, it’s pretty much a vocation rather than a job for people and it’s their way of life, and their customers end up being their friends, so it is quite sad and difficult for them to be at home and not be part of that. When they have come back it’s like walking into the unknown.”Part of the reopening has been a video filmed in one of Stonegate’s Manchester venues, showing staff how things would look and operate. “What we’ve done is we’ve tried to take away any level of anxiety,” she explains.The distancing has depended on which areas they were dealing with, she adds.“Where it’s outside we’ve tried to stick to a 2-metre rule, whereas when it’s inside we’ve tried to use screens, PPE and back-to-back tables. We’ve tried to be a bit more strategic and play around with what the layout looks like. We’ve spoken to all our authorities and they seem pretty happy with what we’ve done.”Hair salons, restaurants and pubs may be something you take for granted. Well, took for granted. Now they’re reopening, operators such as Timperley and Charlesworth feel this is their chance to showcase their new, and often improved, offerings.Timperley says: “Everything that we’ve had to do differently, we’ve done better. For example, the disposable towels are the nicest I could get, and the gowns are scented with vanilla. We’ve tried to keep the luxury touches and as soon as we can introduce more back in, even if we can do a coffee in a disposable cup, that would make it feel nicer again. But I think people will just be so grateful to have their hair done, you know ... what I think has happened is people have tried cutting their hair at home and colouring their hair at home, and they realise how talented hairdressers are!“I think the biggest challenge has been remaining positive in lockdown when everything around you is negative. For me, keeping the staff upbeat and the clients informed. Everything has been extra work.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Yet he ended up in an unmarked grave in London. Or so it has always been believed …Baking sourdough, binge-watching Normal People or Mrs America, learning origami. People have dealt with lockdown in many ways. Personally, I went looking for the bones of Hans Holbein, the German artist who died almost 500 years ago and was dumped in an unmarked grave in the City of London. Or so it has always been believed.Emptied out by coronavirus during lockdown, the City was the perfect place for socially distanced, government-mandated walks. And beneath its streets are the bodies of innumerable plague victims. One in particular haunts me. Holbein died in London, almost certainly of plague, in 1543. The long shadow of bubonic plague permeates his art, in its danse macabre of corpses and skeletons. It seemed appropriate to seek out this master of pestilence in a time of pandemic.Holbein was a Renaissance star. Born in Augsburg, southern Germany, he made a name for himself in the Swiss city of Basel before blazing his way into Britain as a guest of Thomas More, author of Utopia and chancellor to Henry VIII. Later he switched patron to Thomas Cromwell, now enjoying a place in the sun thanks to The Mirror and the Light, the last of Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall trilogy. Holbein made a small fortune painting portraits, ending up as a court artist. Henry sent him to paint Anne of Cleves, to help the monarch decide whether to make her his fourth wife. Then, at the age of 46, Holbein died in London and was buried, it seems, in an unmarked grave.Few painters have matched his eye for living people, but look harder at his work and you see startling warnings that death is ever at your shoulder. In The Ambassadors, in London’s National Gallery, two wealthy men stand in the prime of their lives, dressed in opulent furs and surrounded by symbols of science and culture, from a globe to a lute. It is all rendered in perfect, glowing detail against a sumptuous green curtain.But something cuts across the lower half of the painting and right through their covetable world: a black-and-white smear that interrupts the scene as strikingly as a pandemic. When looked at from the correct angle, the long, thin blur reveals itself to be a human skull – the inescapable presence of death.To ram the point home, Holbein created a series of woodcuts called The Dance of Death, in which the skeletal reaper interrupts people while they are in the middle of ruling, loving or ploughing. To bang in the final nail, he also painted Christ as a rotting corpse. And The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb does not even hint at resurrection – it is simply a deceased man whose face is turning grey and feet are tinged with green. When Dostoevsky saw it in Basel, he was transfixed. “Why, a man’s faith might be ruined by looking at that picture!” he has a character say in The Idiot.Having portrayed death so many times, Holbein found himself in a London struck by plague. A few weeks before he died from plague, according to his 17th-century biographer Karel van Mander, he made a will to provide for his two illegitimate children in England. The exact location of his bones is unknown, so midway through lockdown I decided to go looking back over what clues still remain.My search began at Aldgate underground station, quiet as a grave without its commuters. And it may indeed mark a mass grave: when Victorian workers were tunnelling here, it’s said they hit a wall of human bones. This was reputedly the site of the biggest burial pit during the great plague of 1665. In A Journal of the Plague Year, Daniel Defoe describes how carts dumped bodies into its “common grave of mankind”.Aldgate was where Holbein lived. He may even have drunk from the Aldgate pump, which has been a source of fresh water since the middle ages. In the early 19th century, the pump’s water started killing people. This was traced to the fact that its supply flowed under cemeteries crammed with bacteria-ridden corpses. It is another macabre detail in an area dense with reminders of urban mortality. The gate of one nearby churchyard I found, at St Olave’s, has grisly skulls carved over it. Charles Dickens nicknamed it St Ghastly Grim. There are so many skulls on churches hereabouts, actually, they started to feel like clues.Disease was rife in Holbein’s time. Average life expectancy was about 35, so he did all right to reach his 40s. To live well was to prepare for death. Jean de Dinteville, seen in The Ambassadors, wears a skull badge on his cap. Holbein showed similar acceptance as he had made his will at his Aldgate house: he wasn’t going to be surprised, like the King in The Dance of Death – interrupted as he feasts by a skeleton waiter. In this horrifying woodcut, 34 souls from all walks of life meet a grisly end.St Katharine Cree, one of the Aldgate churches with a claim on the artist, is an ancient gothic survivor, now overshadowed by the tubes and funnels of the Lloyd’s building. It made it through the great fire and the blitz and seemed a good candidate for Holbein’s resting place. But when the art-loving Earl of Arundel wanted to put up a monument to Holbein here in the 17th century, no trace of a grave could be found. The artist, it was concluded, must be in a plague pit somewhere.So people in the 17th century deduced from the very absence of a gravestone or monument that Holbein must have been one of plague’s anonymous victims. Can there be any other explanation?Perhaps he fell foul of a monster king. By 1543, Henry VIII, serial killer of wives, was not best pleased with his court artist. Sent to portray a potential fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, before Henry ever saw her, Holbein came back with such a lovely painting that Henry had musicians play to celebrate. When Anne arrived in person, he claimed to find her too ugly to sleep with. There’s no record of Holbein being punished, though. He was probably saved by the low status of artists in Tudor Britain. In Italy, they might be gods but here they were just manual workers. Holbein was underneath Henry’s radar. Doing away with him would be like having a cook killed for making a substandard pie.I found another possibility, though, under the massive girders that support Cannon Street Bridge. A piece of Britain’s past has gone missing here. In the Renaissance, this was the Steelyard, a community of German Hanseatic League merchants. Holbein made much of his money portraying them. While we treasure his pictures of the English court, his great painting of the Danzig merchant Georg Gisze, produced here, is a highlight of Berlin’s Gemäldegalerie.So here is another reason I wanted to find Holbein’s grave. The UK has left the EU and we pretend we have always been a cultural island, set in a silver sea. Holbein proves otherwise. The greatest “British” Renaissance artist was part of a lost London-German community. This may be why his grave is unknown. In Tudor Britain, foreigners were called “strangers”. Holbein’s friend More spoke out to end a murderous riot against them known as Evil May Day. Was Holbein thrown into a pit not only because he was a plague victim, but also for being a “stranger”?Holbein surely deserves a Denkmal – a place to think things over, as the German word for monument (from denken, to think) beautifully suggests. But where can you think about someone who was thrown in a mass grave? And so my family and I came to St Andrew Undershaft, Holbein’s parish church. It too survives, no longer skulking under the maypole shaft it was named after but beneath the Gherkin.Behind the church are the remnants of its old burial ground. It would be poetic if this little space in the heart of the City harboured Holbein’s grave – because it does make a pleasant spot to think. In the afternoon sunlight, something white stood out against dark soil of the small yard. It was a piece of a jaw, with holes where the teeth once were. It looked uncomfortably human. But I quickly realised, almost with relief, that it was too small. There were other bones scattered around, too. Perhaps they were part of a badly ground fertiliser pack, or relics dug up by scavenging animals. I had not found the remains of Holbein, but it did feel like a message from him. I had gone looking for one of the most assiduous painters of bones ever – and here we were, pondering bones in the plague-stopped city. Did they mark Holbein’s grave? Surely not. But they pointed me back to his art, and to what felt like a solution to this mystery.The skull, the skeletons, the dead Christ – maybe Holbein let himself be thrown in a common grave as his final artistic gesture. After all, in his will he could have left money for a funeral and tomb, as Leonardo da Vinci did in France. By not doing that, he knew he risked the common pit. If this truly was his fate, then he was boldly embracing the insight of his art. From the king to the priest, from the lawyer to the peasant, from the abbess to the artist, we all end up the same in the end: snatched out of existence like the 34 lost souls in that magnificent, haunting masterpiece, The Dance of Death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0411308a3798d42993b5f6480640b35b93691a5/0_118_3142_1886/master/3142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bfa01ac6baf86e149220ff6c12a569f","title":"next generation magnum photographers","story":"From crime-scene torsos to the tension of a chess game – this new wave of photographic talent set out their vision"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc95c063480b5c40bbedcf0c447138888d605110/226_380_3003_1803/master/3003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c8db6717f4d05be83bf0e2789d631fa","title":"new horizons the living landscapes of don mccullin in pictures","story":"From the freezing Arctic and tombs ravaged by Isis to the beauty of his Somerset home, a new exhibition shows another side to the renowned war photographer Photographs: Don McCullin, courtesy of Hauser \u0026amp Wirth"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c0e1002b370597ae0e5cdbf4a5f200ab97837b4/0_246_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0546094b143a24b32143d2d1ce8d75a","title":"covid 19 cases need to keep rising in nsw before restrictions are tightened experts say","story":"Public health experts say contact tracers and hospitals will have to be close to capacity before any potential crackdownCoronavirus cases in New South Wales will need to continue rising at their current rates until at least the middle of next week before the government will consider further tightening social restrictions, public health experts have said.They argue the state’s capacity to rapidly respond to new cases has not yet been overwhelmed.As the cluster linked to the Crossroads Hotel in Sydney’s south-west grew to 40 cases on Thursday, the NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, would not be drawn on specifics in relation to potential further restrictions.But she stressed authorities were not complacent about the challenge of “mopping up” seeding of the virus from the current clusters and people who had returned from Victoria.“I cannot stress the criticality of the current time,” Chant said when announcing contact tracers would begin re-interviewing Covid-19 positive cases who weren’t able to be linked to a source of transmission based on their first interview.“Obviously we are concerned when we find cases that can’t be linked back because it does indicate we have missed a chain.”Chant also announced that in addition to genomic testing – which allowed authorities to confirm the “patient zero” of Sydney’s latest outbreak had come from Melbourne – sewage analysis would be used to detect the virus in areas of Sydney previously thought Covid-19-free.There were 15 new cases announced in NSW on Thursday morning, 10 of which were community transmissions, with six linked to the Crossroads Hotel. At least 21 of the 40-plus cases in the cluster were hotel patrons, with onward transmission occurring at nearby gyms and at restaurants as far away as Brighton-Le-Sands, 25km east of the hotel.The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Wednesday that NSW would consider “further restrictions” but not lockdowns for “any activity which is high risk”.“The health advice tells us indoor events ... we know what is high risk,” Berejiklian said, a day after announcing marshals would enforce restrictions at all hotels and pubs in the state which would be limited to 300 patrons based on the one person per four square metre rule.Marylouise McLaws, a professor of epidemiology at the University of NSW, said the emergence of pubs and restaurants as sources of transmission in the NSW cluster demonstrated how conducive indoor environments were to spreading Covid-19.However, she believes NSW will have to record 100 community transmissions over a 14-day period – when contact tracers and hospitals are nearing their rapid-response capacity – to warrant tighter restrictions being put in place. She believes this trend will be clearer by Tuesday.McLaws said by then there would be data for two incubation periods following the first spread of the virus at the Crossroads Hotel which would show whether there was potentially a second generation.“It’s not as easy ring-fencing a hotspot or a suburb, like what was seen with the public housing outbreaks in Melbourne,” she said.“That was residential, but we’re seeing social venues, pubs and restaurants, now attracting people who live all over Sydney.”McLaws said the current limit of up to 300 people allowed in some venues was “a lot of people” given alcohol can affect their ability to adhere to distancing measures, but said noted “the numbers aren’t telling me yet it’s necessary to decrease gathering limits”.Robert Booy, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, also argued growing infections in NSW did not justify increased restrictions yet.“Having hundreds of people in pubs is literally dangerous. When people are drinking they’re likely to mingle and that’s a real concern ... but what’s really hard is to keep balance between society functioning and our health.”Booy said restrictions should not have to be tightened if indoor gathering rules – including keeping 1.5 metres between patrons – were strictly observed.However, he conceded it would take “weeks not days” to see the impact of newly tightened rules on pubs introduced this week and how people responded to news coverage of the current outbreak.“I don’t think we should be making decisions based on two or three days of experience. We have to be considering the long term.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88c948cdf0dfbed16370df2e2712a651379cb31a/0_211_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5967d5cf67183d9411f7aa768b1aecee","title":"why we drive by matthew crawford review a high speed reverse into nostalgia","story":"A macho speed merchant provides some terrific moments but fails in his general defence of cars and motorbikes against new technologiesMatthew Crawford would have huge respect for Gatsonides, while despising his invention. A speed camera brooks no argument, and Crawford loves to argue. In Why We Drive, he recalls being clocked doing 86mph on his motorbike in a 55 zone and explaining to the traffic cop how the laws of physics should trump arbitrary speed limits. He is delighted when the case reaches court and he can go full Atticus Finch. He imagines the judge’s delight at his presence: “What they rarely get in traffic court is an argument, or an attempt at rhetoric – the stuff that presumably made them want to go to law school.” He then declares, as though it was someone else’s fault: “A couple of months later, it happened again.”Why We Drive follows his bestselling Shop Class as Soulcraft (published in the UK as The Case for Working with Your Hands) and The World Beyond Your Head in making the case for freedom in a technological society. This time, he takes aim at the new digital technologies that threaten his relationship with the old technologies he loves: cars and motorbikes. The book contains some terrific moments – an explanation of how human and machine contrived to crash two Boeing 737s a description of the suck-squeeze-bang-blow four-stroke that happens a billion times in an engine’s life – but its big and important argument is muddied by the author’s prejudices.The book’s middle is like being taken for a drive by a hyperactive, unreliable uncle. You’re going a way you don’t recognise and you’ve been told not to put on your seatbelt because seatbelts are for squares. As you cling to the sides of your seat, he takes you past a stock car rally, then an off-road race course in the desert. Just as you’re approaching something familiar, there’s a handbrake turn and off you go down a detour on the Nazis, a bit on utilitarianism, then a lesson on how to drift. He rolls down the window to shout something at some “bicycle moralists”. There is a merciless digression about rebuilding a VW Beetle and some of the author’s drawings of gears. His justification for all of this is what he calls “philosophical anthropology”, but its real purpose is to tell you what he approves of – mechanics, motorsports, motorbikes, the autobahn, real men and old-fashioned women – and what he doesn’t like: bicycles, the pencil pushers at the DMV, “safetyism” and Portland, Oregon.He is selective in his nostalgia and romanticises bits of the present that other freedom-loving iniduals would object to. In his view, it’s fine to destroy speed cameras, but it’s not fine for grown-ups to ride bicycles. His description of the traffic in Rome having an “improvisation and flow that is beautiful to behold” suggests he has never tried to cross the road there. He admires London’s taxi drivers for their Knowledge and their enthusiasm for Brexit (see the subtitle, “take back control”) and mourns their slow death by GPS.We do not have to see cabbies as heroes to critique Uber’s data-hoarding gig economy. Nor do we have to admire rule-breaking in general to see that some of the devices that constrain our driving are counterproductive. The “shared space” movement in Europe has been making the case for decades that roads need more uncertainty, not more rules, in order to slow down cars. Crawford would appreciate their motto – “unsafe is safe” – but he isn’t much interested in shared space. He wants his own space. If, as he argues, “the road is a place of mutual trust”, what should we think of a motorcyclist doing 86 through a 55mph speed limit?The benefits of cars come with an extraordinary potential to do harm. We can be legitimately horrified that more than a million people a year die on the world’s roads, while being also surprised that most of us, most of the time, do not get into danger. Crawford hates what he calls the “safety industrial complex” that has taken all the joy out of driving. Here he is at odds with historians and activists such as Ralph Nader who have catalogued the US car industry’s opposition to regulations and safety innovations that aim to protect drivers from their own delusions.Cars, for Crawford, are liberty: “The gas pedal and the steering wheel are wired directly to your will, via the seat of your pants, and there is no committee involved.” But it takes a lot of staging to maintain the performance of freedom. Driving, even in rural America, requires a byzantine arrangement of infrastructures and rules, in addition to the common sense that Crawford admires. The German philosopher Max Horkheimer wrote as long ago as 1947 that “It is as if the innumerable laws, regulations and directions with which we must comply were driving the car, not we.”Many of us do not share Crawford’s need for speed. We want our cars to be safe and we are slaves to, rather than masters of, this technology. So many of our lives and places are structured around the car and we collectively find it hard to build the alternative forms of mobility that would allow us to escape traffic, pollution and danger. Are self-driving cars the answer?Crawford is understandably worried that the same tech companies that have taken over navigation, devaluing the cab drivers’ Knowledge overnight, are now coming for the rest of the world’s drivers. It’s not that simple. Having generated huge hype, self-driving evangelists are now starting to admit that their challenge is harder than they first made it seem. Teaching a computer to drive is not like teaching a computer to win at chess. However, there is a risk that, as with the car a hundred years ago, the rules of the road will eventually be changed to suit a new technology and, in doing so, will impede other ways of getting around. Freeing us from driving could require enormous digital infrastructures and monopolistic control. The people selling “autonomous vehicles” should heed, and be worried by, Crawford’s argument for autonomous people.Car culture, as with many traditions invoked by conservatives, is a relatively recent invention, propped up by powerful industrial interests. Arguments against the claims of new technologies need not be as reactionary as Crawford’s. In the space between a souped-up vintage Beetle and a speculative self-driving Uber, we can imagine a range of progressive possibilities.

Alternatives could include mobile banking hubs, cash delivery, commissioning free-to-use ATMs, and will have to be clearly outlined to customers at least three months in advance.“This would give customers time to take action in light of that information, such as changing banking provider,” the FCA said.The guidelines – which are up for consultation but could be in force by December – will ensure people can continue to withdraw and deposit cash, and make cash or cheque payments for mortgages and loans. Firms that breach the guidelines would face enforcement action, including fines.It is part of a wider effort to help preserve cash infrastructure as local branches and free-to-use cash machines disappear across the UK.

Some of those countries who were relying on trade are having to reconsider, and to rely more on their domestic market rather than exports.Secondly, Lagarde predicts a “cultural, sociological, and maybe philosophical change” from the pandemic -- with iniduals and companies both giving more value to goods made locally.Consumers will be more attentive to the origin of goods, the place of manufacturing.And corporates themselves, who had been largely dependent on far away supply chains, or very complicated and fragmented supply chains, suddenly rediscover the benefit of proximity.The rise in Covid-19 cases in the US is worrying the European Central Bank.ECB chief Christine Lagarde was just asked about the surge of infections in America in recent weeks, at her press conference in Frankfurt.She replies that “of course it is a concern” - a concern for the livelihoods of people, the lives of people.It’s something which the ECB’s governing council discussed during its meeting this week, as it assessed the macroeconomic outlook.We have taken account of the environment in which the euro are zone operatesWe have taken into account the potential risk of a second wave and a measures that could be taken as a result of that.The latest data shows that Covid-19 cases are now increasing in 41 of America’s 50 states, with nearly 3.5m people now having been infected.Worryingly, the recovery in US unemployment seems to have fizzled out.As Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal shows, the number of people losing their jobs and filing fresh welfare claims has only been falling slowly for weeks. There was virtually no improvement at all last week.That suggests alarming churn in the US economy, with swathes of workers losing their jobs each week. Before the crisis, the initial jobless claims figure was hovering in the low 200,000s. It’s now hovering around 1.3m....Economists are disappointed that so many Americans are being forced to file new claims for unemployment welfare, four months after the lockdown began.Here’s some snap reaction to the initial claims report:Newsflash: 1.3 million Americans filed new claims for unemployment support last week, as the Covid-19 pandemic forced some states to lock down again.The weekly initial jobless claims total barely fell week-on-week - dipping to 1.3m from 1.31m a week ago.This suggests little progress in healing the US labor market - with many companies continuing to lay staff off. That could be due to weak demand, or because they were forced to shut following coronavirus spikes across the country. The number of Americans filing ‘continued claims’ for jobless suppport also barely shifted, coming in at 17.338m from 17.76m a week ago.The initial jobless claims total has now exceeded one million for every week since March - something that had never happened before this year. Economists reckon the European Central Bank is slipping into ‘wait and see’ mode, while it assesses the state of the eurozone economy.The ECB also wants to see the results of tomorrow’s EU summit on the Recovery Fund. Can politicians square their differences and agree a €750bn package, or will arguments about shared debts and whether to hand out grants or loans scupper it? “As the ECB switches to the ‘wait-and-see’ mode for the rest of the summer, the focus shift towards the Recovery Fund and the long-term budget. This week’s Summit might not bring a final agreement just yet, but any progress on the most contentious issues, including governance and conditionality, would send a strong signal on the prospects for the breakthrough in the near future.” Sam Cooper, Vice President of Market Risk Solutions at Silicon Valley Bank, agrees:“The decision to leave interest rates unchanged and keep the powder dry was no surprise to FX markets. The main area of focus remains on the upcoming leaders meeting in Brussels and the form in which the blocwide support package will take, until then we can expect the euro to keep testing it’s recent upward momentum, particularly against the dollar. “Newsflash from Frankfurt: The European Central Bank has left eurozone interest rates at their current record lows.The ECB is also maintaining its current Covid-19 stimulus package, and repeated its pledge to keep buying assets until next summer: The Governing Council will continue its purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,350 billion.These purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary policy stance, thereby helping to offset the pandemic-related downward shift in the projected path of inflation. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows the Governing Council to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy.The Governing Council will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of June 2021 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. ING economist Iris Pang has hiked her growth forecasts for China, while also warning that the recovery could be bumpy.The biggest risk we see is the technology war, not just with the US but also with the rest of the world. China has put a lot of money into R\u0026ampD in advanced technology to achieve self-reliance on the most advanced semiconductor chips but it will take time to yield results. Ed Moya of OANDA thinks investors are being too pessimistic about the drop in Chinese retail sales: China’s economy is back into growth territory following steady stimulus and relatively strong success in battling COVID-19. The rebound in China however is mostly on the industrial side and not the consumer. The Chinese retail data however is not as bad it seems, as automobiles, catering, jewelry, and petroleum goods were the main categories that posted declines.Reuters is reporting that Nissan will cut its car production worldwide sharply this year, due to the pandemic.It’s another sign that the world economy is weak, with the lockdown denting demand for travel, consumers nervous about big purchases, and production lost to factory shutdowns.Here’s the story:Japan’s No. 2 automaker plans to produce around 2.6 million vehicles between April and December, down from 3.7 million during the same period last year, the sources said.Global automakers are struggling after factories were shuttered earlier this year to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Car dealerships were also closed in many countries, pummelling vehicle sales in March through May, although the fall in sales slowed in June. Nissan employs around 6,000 people at its UK factory in Sunderland, where one worker tested positive for Covid-19 this week.Here’s my colleague Richard Partington on today’s worrying UK jobs data:Paid employment in Britain has plunged by almost 650,000 employees since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March, official figures show, as growing numbers of companies cut jobs.Analysts at trading firm XM also see a V-shaped recovery in China’s GDP figures today:XM, like other economists today, blame the surprise drop in Chinese retail sales in June....But rather than be reassured by the upbeat headline numbers, investors finally seem to be touching base with reality as the warning signs that the global recovery will be a bumpy one continue to grow. Up until now, the resurgence of virus infections in several countries had failed to dent hopes of a speedy and robust recovery. But the slow pickup in domestic demand in China appears to have dealt a major blow to those expectations.Retail sales in China fell on an annual basis for the fifth straight month in June, suggesting consumers are not yet feeling confident enough to revert to their pre-pandemic spending habits.Getting back to the Chinese growth figures, economist George Magnus argues that China is enjoying a V-shaped recovery.The UK is gearing up for a record-breaking year for government debt sales.The Treasury announced this morning that the Debt Management Office will raise £385bn through sales of gilts, from April to November this year -- more than in any year before.The DMO had previously been aiming to raise £275bn in April to August, so this implies another £110bn will be raised in September to November.The higher volume of issuance seen so far this year due to COVID-19 is not expected to persist over the final four months of the year.Yesterday, chancellor Rishi Sunak warned of ‘tough choices’ to address the deficit, which is going to hit a peacetime record in 2020-21. Covid-19 has also taken a chunk out of Europe’s trade surplus.As a result, the EU recorded a €7.1bn surplus in trade in goods with the rest of the world in May 2020, compared with €18.6bn in May 2019.The EU’s trade surplus with the UK has also narrowed this year.This has shrunk the EU-UK trade balance from €55.2bn to €38.5bn.

This summer has been painful for Heineken, and the balance sheet may force some hard decisions in the future, but in the long run we think they’ll do just fine.The brands are still strong and, though it may take some time, once the pubs get back into full swing profits should pick back up.”Neil Wilson of Markets reckons geopolitical jitters are hitting stocks:US-China tensions are bubbling away – plans by the White House to impose travel restrictions on millions of Chinese Communist party members is the latest in the saga.

Although the UK government has sought to play down accusations that the decision was politically motivated, insisting it was a “technical decision”, in reality it could scarcely be more political.After repeatedly failing to convince British intelligence services that Huawei posed a national security risk, the US decided to force the UK’s hand by imposing new sanctions that cut off the company from international semiconductor supplies. This left the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre with little choice but to advise that Huawei equipment should not be used in the UK’s 5G network, souring relations between London and Beijing.Washington’s fears about Huawei are genuine. But beneath the rhetoric about national security lies a deeper concern: that China’s economic model may have the potential to rival the productive power of liberal capitalism – and threaten the technological supremacy that has long underpinned US hegemony thanks to its world-leading university, military and tech sectors.After Deng Xiaoping initiated China’s reforms and opening-up process in 1978, most western economists assumed that China would follow the path of other former communist societies: economic liberalisation would be followed by political democratisation, and China would join the club of liberal democracies. But not only has liberal democracy not arrived in the People’s Republic, the Chinese Communist party has developed a distinct economic model that has lifted nearly a billion people out of poverty and transformed China into one of the world’s largest and most dynamic economies.Officially called “socialism with Chinese characteristics”, China’s economic model combines strategic state ownership and planning with market-orientated incentives and a one-party political system. In contrast to most western economies, the commanding industrial heights of the economy are owned and controlled by a vast state holding company that reports directly to China’s state council the financial system is tightly controlled and subordinated to policy objectives and long-term planning and investment decisions are overseen by the powerful National Development and Reform Commission.Huawei has become the international poster child for the success of this model. Although not a state-owned enterprise, the company has received significant support from the Chinese state, including a $30bn line of credit from the China Development Bank. Thanks in part to this support, it has emerged as the unrivalled global leader in the development of 5G networks, and recently overtook Samsung as the world’s largest smartphone maker.Although Huawei is the first Chinese tech company to become globally dominant, it is unlikely to be the last. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, Beijing has made no secret of its ambition for China to achieve self-sufficiency in strategic technologies such as advanced information technology, robotics, aerospace, green vehicles and biotechnology. While the US was happy to encourage China’s economic development when it provided a cheap pool of labour for western supply chains, the goal of achieving technological self-sufficiency has set alarm bells ringing in Washington.The influential thinktank, the Council on Foreign Relations, has described China’s plans as a “real existential threat to US technological leadership”, while the US trade representative Robert Lighthizer acknowledged they pose “a very, very serious challenge”. Strategists fear that allowing China to continue with these plans could lead to the US losing technological supremacy in key strategic sectors such as information technology, telecommunications and artificial intelligence – along with the economic, military and geopolitical power that comes with it.For all the rhetoric about a trade war, rising tensions between the US and China have never really been about trade. From the beginning, the US has been concerned with preventing China’s rise as a rival technological power. In the case of Huawei, the Trump administration’s goal is clear: to crush one of the first Chinese tech companies to become globally competitive, and prevent it from gaining a dominant position in a key infrastructure of the future. This strategy is not without its risks, and could easily backfire. By pressuring countries not to do business with Chinese firms and cutting them off from global supply chains, Washington may end up inadvertently accelerating Beijing’s efforts to develop domestic capabilities in leading technologies, thus fuelling these tensions even further.While talk of a new “cold war” may be overblown, it’s no longer inconceivable to imagine a future where countries can use US technology or Chinese technology – but not both. In the longer term, a shift in this direction could fragment or even unwind the integration of our globalised economy.It’s tempting to view the UK’s dilemma about Huawei as an unfortunate consequence of being caught in the crossfire between two superpowers. But in many ways the UK’s predicament can be traced to its own domestic policy failures. When Huawei was founded in the late 1980s, it was the UK – not China – that was a world leader in telecommunication technology. With homegrown firms such as STC, Racal, GEC, Marconi and Ferranti, the UK was second only to the US when it came to telecoms ingenuity. But in the following decades, successive UK governments allowed leading telecoms technology companies to be taken over and sold off to overseas firms. In thrall to free-market orthodoxy, British manufacturing and industry was sacrificed in the interests of the City of London and the financial sector.While Huawei’s rise is undoubtedly a story of Chinese success, it is also a story of Anglo-American decline. The global financial crisis laid bare the underlying weaknesses of neoliberal capitalism, but without a clear alternative to take its place the response was to double down on a broken model. In the years since, stagnant wages and productivity, and spiralling inequality have fuelled a surge of political discontent on both sides of the Atlantic.If Anglo-American capitalism was already on life support, the catastrophic handling of the coronavirus crisis in the UK and the US has administered the lethal blow. Far from being viewed as successful models to emulate, the US and the UK are increasingly turning into cautionary tales to avoid.None of this is to say that China’s variant of authoritarian capitalism is a desirable alternative, or that governments should turn a blind eye to the abuses of the Chinese state. But rebuffing Chinese technology and stoking anti-China sentiment will not cure the ills of Anglo-American capitalism. The roots of these problems, and therefore their solutions, can instead be found much closer to home.• Laurie Macfarlane is economics editor at openDemocracy and a fellow at the UCL Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0650d6ee9850096d4532a886e50d7075211d15c/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=841f2e65bfdc44dc87d859116683c3fb","title":"so long sweetie what next for the air kiss","story":"Associated with Ab Fab and the front row, social distancing is putting a stop to cheek-pecking. But what will fashion be without its equivalent of the masonic handshake?Was it horror that flashed through Miuccia Prada’s eyes as I leant towards her with my lips puckered? As she stepped back and offered me her hand, with a Mona Lisa smile, it was clear I had misread the moment. Thankfully, her practised reaction was so smooth that only the two of us, and her hovering bodyguard, appeared to be aware of the micro-debacle.This is the kind of thing that happens to people like me backstage at fashion shows. People who, shall we say, aren’t exactly a big deal but have to wedge themselves among the great and the good in order to get quotes for news reports.I have almost air kissed Kanye West, Stella McCartney and Demna Gvasalia, to name just a few. I do not want to smooch famous designers who don’t have a clue who I am, I promise. But when you are captive within a scrum of abundant cheek-peckers, it is all too easy to get stuck on air kissing autopilot.I worked in the less-coiffed world of features journalism before fashion and it has taken me six years to understand the rules. I now know that true alphas tend to save face-adjacent smooches for people they know, celebrities or people in decision-making roles at luxury conglomerates. Isabella Blow, for example, claimed that fending off kisses “from all and sundry” was the reason she always wore huge hats. Stories of Anna Wintour darting out of range, leaving wannabe air-kissers stumbling, are rife and toe-curling.At the last physical London fashion week, which opened two weeks after the UK’s first coronavirus case was confirmed, it became clear how ingrained the practice is. People were air kissing while discussing increased hygiene measures and pumping gel from newly installed hand sanitiser stations. The tsunami of “mwahs” did not stop, even as the news worsened and masks were given out at Paris fashion week.“Are you still air kissing?” I asked one editor, late in February. “Absolutely not,” she said. “If I see someone looming, I tell them to back off.” I was not that brave, however. I was still air kissing, out of reflex, or politeness, despite feeling weird about it, until early March, around the same time that France and Italy banned cheek-pecking and even fashion people finally abandoned it.For the past five months the issue has been moot, with fashion occupying a strange virtual world of digital couture and Zoom webinars. This week saw the first physical shows since the pandemic began, in Milan, but they were socially distanced affairs. For the foreseeable future, a return to air kissing, as we know it, seems unlikely.This enforced pause - which comes as the fashion industry faces a raft of other significant shifts - feels like the moment to give air kissing a goodbye, or at least au revoir, analysis.Air kissing is a very strange custom, when you think about it, expressing both closeness and separation. “It is not a ‘real’ kiss,’’ says the fashion historian Tony Glenville. “It is often very fleeting, almost on the move, with the giver already checking who else is around. But people are dreadful at remembering names, so ‘Darling!’ plus a double air kiss, is useful.”“It is fashion’s equivalent of the masonic handshake,” says Love Magazine’s senior editor Pierre A M’Pelé, “a dramatised version of reality, a proof of acknowledgement and grouping.” It can be useful, he adds, for greeting in a friendly way with boundaries, but, “it can be weaponised, too. Its purposes, depending on how it is performed, can go from real fondness to total disdain.”Cheek kisses are commonplace in other touchy-feely industries, such as theatre, says the body language expert Judi James, who believes the classic fashion air kiss is different. “It is more about holding people at arm’s length. Both heads are held high. It is more about torso distance than submission.”A contact-free peck feels counter-intuitive given that human kissing “probably started via mimicry of the parent feeding the child by chewing the food in its own mouth first, like a bird”, says James. Kissing is also thought to have biological functions, such as sniffing out hormones. By removing anything animalistic, the air kiss “takes a signal of attachment and turns it on its head”.For all its peculiarities, air kissing’s influence has spread. Vogue China’s editor-in-chief, Angelica Cheung, has air kissed her way around fashion weeks for almost 20 years. “In China, and other parts of Asia, such a greeting is generally considered to be a little too informal and overly familiar,” she says. “Having said that, in fashion circles in China, air kissing has become common, but usually when there is an international element to the event.”I have always assumed fashion’s air kissing tendencies were due to its Parisian roots. That may be where it started, but the absence of lip-to-cheek contact is not very French. “There is not even a French term for ‘air kiss’,” says the fashion academic Agnès Rocamora. Instead, the anthropologist Vaughn M Bryant believes it became popular in around the 1950s. “The purpose is not to mess up a lady’s makeup,” he says. “This is especially true with models and also in Hollywood.”My sources agree that it became particularly rampant in fashion in the 1980s, which is when Chris Moore, a catwalk photographer of 60 years’ standing, thinks he noticed it. “I call it a fashion kiss,” he says. It is inherently hierarchical, he points out: “It’s a bit difficult to lean over and do a fashion kiss to someone in the second row.”For the academics Dr Joanne Entwistle and Rocamora, it is a ritual that makes power dynamics visible. In 2006, the pair attended London fashion week for a research paper observing industry customs. “It is a performance of a kiss in an industry dependent on appearances,” says Entwistle. “It’s a flamboyant signal of connection and social capital, its purpose not just for the two people kissing but for anyone who might be watching.”Unlike, say, a macho slap on the back, the air kiss is clearly the expression of a female-skewed industry. That it took off in the 80s also fits with cliched ideas about women entering the workplace and jostling for supremacy while ricocheting off one another’s shoulderpads. Certainly, the decade’s power-dressing trends – heavy makeup, giant earrings and carapace of lacquered hair – must have made lip-on-cheek contact inadvisable.If the 80s was peak air kiss, the 90s was when the practice became a cultural phenomenon, thanks to Absolutely Fabulous. The “mwah, mwah, sweetie” catchphrase mined the custom for comedy gold, our heroines delivering it through gritted-teeth to enemies, as often as they did, through a Bolly haze, to each other.Parodying the air kiss too mercilessly can feel unhelpful when it ties into outdated narratives about female rivalry in the workplace. But questioning customs is important in an industry in which most humans – disabled people, people of colour, working-class people, plus-sized people – have traditionally been excluded. Unwritten rules – weird greeting rituals a sense that everyone else is firm friends – can form another invisible barrier.Everyone I spoke to had an air kissing war story. Many in the industry told me they didn’t like the practice at all. “I think sadly something that started off as a lovely gesture of friendship has come to be parodied and associated with something vacuous and meaningless,” says Daniel Marks, the Communication Store’s chief creative officer. The PR Mandi Lennard, more of a handshake woman herself, says: “I think it’s really phoney. I’d hate someone I didn’t know well to regard me as overfamiliar.”But for all the mishaps and complaints, it took a pandemic for fashion people to stop doing it. And here’s a concerning thought: some I spoke to had seen the odd clandestine air kiss happening again, already. In fact, air kissing is not the most perilous greeting for socially distanced times. The University of Hong Kong’s Yuguo Li says, if you are at least 1.5m apart, with no contact at all, the risk is low Dr Julian Tang, a respiratory sciences professor at the University of Leicester, adds that the risks are further reduced outside. I worry that this is all the encouragement some – and then, inevitably, me – will need to start air kissing at great distance, introducing even more absurdity.In any case, its spirit lives on on social media, a business that monetises status anxiety and encourages users to make “content” out of their connections. On Instagram, you can display proximity to power by screenshotting a Zoom meeting, or perform closeness by posting an in-joke underneath a contact’s post. Or, if you don’t know them well enough for an in-joke, a handful of emojis will do. As M’Pele says: “The kissing emoji – the one without the heart – is the new air kiss.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b89e74e549764386b3a434cc2f9c143f45b061a/0_175_6049_3630/master/6049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b364878e4df7e0ce7af43d1ca2bdc9d","title":"collaborations backstage films and a pop up show paris mens digital fashion week in pictures","story":"The global pandemic saw the springsummer 2021 Paris menswear shows delayed but they still went ahead, online.

In 1933, as surrealism was considered by many artists an essential riposte to the bourgeois conformity that was enabling fascism, Buñuel boldly began work on a new film, entitled Land Without Bread – a supposed documentary about the desperately poor region of Las Hurdes in western Spain, whose wretchedness was blandly ignored by the central government.Buñuel was able to make it because his friend, the anarchist Ramón Acín, had won the lottery and offered to put up the cash – an irresistible surrealist omen. The animation shows how Buñuel (voiced by Jorge Usón) and his colleagues journeyed into Las Hurdes villages, whose rooftops looked like turtle shells, and how Buñuel himself, with the ruthlessness (or unscrupulousness) of the born artist, started faking or staging the kind of spectacular moments he needed: goats falling off cliffs, donkeys attacked by bees.Was he making a documentary with the earnest intention of helping the inhabitants? Or creating an amoral, self-serving spectacle of bizarreness, which would be of no help to the people of Las Hurdes? This is interspersed with clips from the black-and-white film itself (sound effects discreetly added), which inevitably looks fiercer, denser and punchier than the animation.This film shows Buñuel offending the villagers by dressing as a nun, but gives no sense of the pure performative strangeness that must have emboldened him to behave like this. There are dreamy-surreal memory scenes of Buñuel’s childhood and his mother. These are very Almódovar. An interesting introduction to the original film.• Buñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles is available on BFI Player."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf3966c2aef922e573aa6567d51033d00f30b49d/205_52_1549_930/master/1549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc55de2954bf29143dd286ce54050c86","title":"good manners review marco dutra juliana rojas nanny horror brazil","story":"São Paulo is transformed into a spooky fairytale landscape in this elegant, unsettling tale of a pregnant woman and her prospective employee There’s an enjoyably inscrutable performance at the heart of this Brazilian fairytale for grownups. Clara (Isabél Zuaa), an unsmiling mystery women, arrives at the luxurious São Paulo apartment of pregnant Ana (Marjorie Estiano), to be interviewed for the position of nanny. But is that really the role on offer? And is Clara an entirely honest applicant?The first third of this two-hour-plus film keeps us wondering. It’s clear that something is off between the women, but impossible to determine where the balance of power lies. Is this a Rosemary’s Baby-style horror about satanic foetus worship? A Parasite-like study of the subversive intimacy between domestic servant and employer? Or some unholy combination of the two? Then, with all the sprightly mischief of one of Ana’s country-music workout videos, the plot dances off again, in an entirely different direction.To say any more would be to ruin the unpredictable pleasures of a genuinely surprising film, but everything Good Manners does – from lesbian sex scenes to furry animatronics – it does with elegance, humour and in shades of moonlit blue. Rui Poças’s painterly cinematography turns the tower blocks of a modern city into a kind of enchanted wood, complete with its own take on the big bad wolf from the storybooks.Clara proves as hard to ruffle as she is to read, a quality that is sorely tested by the film’s events. Some may appreciate a strand of body horror that relates specifically to the female body and motherhood. More squeamish viewers can be reassured that these grisly moments are rare and interspersed with musical numbers. Also contained within the story is a heartwarming and timely tribute to care workers, both unpaid and underpaid.

The title was out of the question – there were more capable teams than us – but I knew we had a special team and the club just wanted to see improvement on the pitch.Thanks to the sale of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to Atlético Madrid a year earlier, we were able to invest in players. I’d been to Scotland to watch Mark Viduka playing for Celtic a few times and knew he would be perfect for us. He was a big, strong forward who could hold the ball up and someone we could play off, but he could also score plenty of goals. I was never involved in the financial side of things, but I told the board for the money – around £7m – he was absolutely perfect for us and they agreed. We got him and he turned out to be one of my best ever buys.Then there was Olivier Dacourt, who I’d been impressed with when he was at Everton. I thought he would be ideal for us. It was then about getting him to come to Leeds and selling him the dream of what he wanted to do. Again, we got our man – Olivier was another brilliant signing who improved the team.We’d made that poor start to the season domestically and we also had a tough draw in the Champions League qualifying round, against 1860 Munich. We weren’t playing well, but we managed to scrape through over two legs after a brilliant 1-0 away win in the second leg.We got Barcelona, Milan and Besiktas in the first group stage, and we didn’t have our players back from injury in time for the first game – a daunting trip to the Nou Camp. Anybody can go to Barcelona and get beaten, but if you go there with a young team like ours and missing six first-team players, you’re in trouble. To have any chance you need your full team out, but we didn’t have that – and it turned out we were in a lot more trouble than I’d predicted.We got absolutely hammered. We were 2-0 down inside 20 minutes and ended up losing 4-0. Some people behind the scenes were in a panic after that game, but they didn’t understand what Barcelona was or the problems we had. It was our first game as a young team going to a club like that and we did it with half a squad. For all I was gutted we’d got beaten, I knew there were reasons behind it.I knew we were a lot better than that result made out, so I knew we would improve – and we did. We went unbeaten for the remaining five games of the first group stage, beating Milan at home and getting a draw away, as well as drawing at home to Barcelona.So we qualified for the second group phase, where we were drawn against Real Madrid, Lazio and Anderlecht. Three capital cities. We went to some amazing places – Munich, Madrid, Rome, Brussels, Barcelona, Milan, Istanbul – all in one season. The great thing about that squad was that they were young and a bit naive. So they were totally fearless and really, really brave. We had some great young players. Players like Jonathan Woodgate, Harry Kewell, Alan Smith and Stephen McPhail, who could handle the pressure of playing in the biggest games.They weren’t experienced and never overanalysed things. They relished the big occasions and they would never freeze, even on the biggest stages. We would train on the pitch before an away game and you could just tell the players were inspired by playing in the biggest, most famous stadiums on the planet and what had happened at these venues. From the Bernabéu to the San Siro, they wanted to be part of the stadium’s history.We added another unbelievable young player in November, when we signed Rio Ferdinand from West Ham. We had a brilliant leader in Lucas Radebe – but he was struggling with his knee, so the club asked me for three options to recruit, all at different prices. I said Rio was the top one we could get, but I told them he would cost about £10m. I was actually quite shocked when they told me we were signing him for £18m – I might even have expressed doubts if I’d been asked about it – but they were convinced. He was already a world-class player and he proved to be an incredible signing.Real Madrid beat us at Elland Road – Raúl and Fernando Hierro got the goals – and then we went to Rome to play Sven-Göran Eriksson’s special Lazio side, who had won Serie A the year before. Viduka was as good a centre-forward as anyone in Europe that night and we got a result, winning 1-0 through an Alan Smith goal 10 minutes from time. That was a great occasion and Sven was very complimentary afterwards.We were still struggling with playing in Europe and keeping up our league form, though. We were a young group learning on the job, but we were expected to do what Manchester United and Arsenal had been doing for years. After a big European night and the travel, we were tired and often struggled to refocus. After the win in Rome, we went to Southampton on the Saturday, played really poorly and lost.We got very lucky against Anderlecht in our next European games, though. By the time we played them in back-to-back Champions League matches in February, we had the weekend in between off because we’d already been knocked out of the FA Cup. We didn’t play well in the first game at home but we dug out a win, coming from behind with two late goals. Then we had the whole weekend to prepare for the second game, with the experience and the lessons of that first game fresh in our minds.Olivier Dacourt heard that the Anderlecht coach had said we were lucky in that first game and that our players were overrated, so when he told the rest of the squad about that it was a great motivation for the return game. The players always had a great attitude, but that gave them added incentive. Our performance in Brussels was probably one of our best in my entire three years at Leeds. We won 4-1 and completely annihilated them. It all came together perfectly.Three days later, we went to Tottenham and won – and won well. That was particularly pleasing. It was always going to be a tough game. They were managed by former Leeds manager George Graham, who I was managed by at Arsenal and was assistant to at Leeds. So they – and he – really wanted to win, but we proved we were learning how to maintain our Premier League form after coming back from a European game.We were on a hell of a run, and played superbly to beat a really top-class Deportivo La Coruña in the quarter-finals. We played our best football for a full 90 minutes in the first leg, with a great atmosphere at Elland Road. We won the game 3-0, with goals from Ian Harte, Smith and Ferdinand.I knew it wasn’t over, though. Deportivo were a team that scored a lot of goals and we faced an onslaught in the away leg. We got a right lesson in that return game, but we only lost 2-0 and clung on – deservedly – to progress.We’d started off in August against 1860 Munich and nobody would have believed in May we’d be playing a semi-final against Valencia. Of course it was very disappointing when we lost to them, but I was so proud of the team. Valencia were a very, very experienced team – they’d got to the Champions League final the year before and had knocked a very good Arsenal side out in the previous round.We had played loads of games over the course of the season, but fatigue didn’t come into it. We were just beaten by the better team over two games. The players had overachieved massively, and I was lucky to have had that group. We made it so near, but just couldn’t make that final step. We finished the league season strongly but missed out on the Champions League places by a point, so we didn’t have the chance to go on another run like the 2000-01 season.It was a real pity we never won anything. A bit like Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham, with the team we had at that time, we really should have won a trophy. We’d put together a really top group of lads who wanted to play the football I asked them to play, and they were full of hunger.Even though we didn’t win anything, the Leeds supporters were always behind me. I cannot believe the way I’m treated by them, even now. They always let me know they were on my side. That run to the Champions League semi-finals built a bond between us that will always be there.• This article was published first by The Coaches’ Voice• Follow them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d941ec676bbddff966cf0b3c7a1545b2132d2f05/0_97_3276_1966/master/3276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d0d0b0467408e4708bca1189ba04200","title":"spurs and southampton in talks over hojbjerg swap deal with walker peters","story":"Tottenham are in negotiations with Southampton over a deal that would see Pierre-Emile Højbjerg move to north London and Kyle Walker-Peters make a permanent switch in the opposite direction.There is a growing confidence on all sides that the deal will happen, with José Mourinho having identified Højbjerg as the holding player he needs to rebalance Spurs’s midfield. At 24, the one-time Bayern Munich wunderkind fits Tottenham’s ideal profile for a signing. Walker-Peters has enjoyed himself since joining Southampton on loan in January – he has played regularly since the Premier League’s restart – and he is open to continuing his career at St Mary’s.The biggest hurdle to overcome concerns the valuation of the players. Southampton had put a £35m price tag on Højbjerg before lockdown but his situation has since changed. The club have stripped him of the captaincy and he has been left out of the team in recent games. With one year to run on his contract, Southampton would seek about £25m for him. Spurs rate Walker-Peters highly but Southampton will not pay a premium for a player with relatively little league experience. There is also the deflationary impact of coronavirus to consider.Mourinho is under pressure to make a success of Spurs’s record signing, Tanguy Ndombele, who joined last summer from Lyon for a little under £60m on a lucrative six-year contract. The midfielder’s value has decreased after a difficult first season but it would be hard to see Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, cutting any sort of losses on such an outlay.The discussion at Spurs has turned to how Mourinho – who has used Ndombele only sparingly – can create a platform for him to thrive. Signing Højbjerg to play a disciplined role in front of the back four with Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso, another expensive recruit, in more advanced positions in a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 has merit.Mourinho said last week that Spurs would not stand in Walker-Peters’ way should the 23-year-old wish to move on. “The general feeling is there’s a place for him here,” Mourinho said. “But if his desire is to be playing every time and leaving the club in search of happiness, I don’t think we’d stop him. He’s a player with a good value in the market but I don’t think we’d stop him doing it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd4ab8dff9187ab9737cbc5aca6836a4b70df3b2/0_63_1872_1123/master/1872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55f7e392f662190c4c868e3208744586","title":"jack charlton a giant fish and the memories that make us love sport","story":"News of the World Cup winner’s death led me down an unexpected and moving path that captured the joys of footballIt’s Saturday at 8.45am. I’m sitting three metres away from my TalkSport co-presenter, Charlie Baker, who is in turn sitting three metres away from our producer, Joe. We are trying to come up with a vaguely amusing text subject for our show that starts in 15 minutes. We settle on village cricket anecdotes – back after months, it’s a goldmine of funny stories.I tweet out a question and the answers start rolling in – a guy whose mum insisted he wear a bike helmet while fielding, a model aircraft crash-landing into the umpire’s leg and a team with five volunteer fireman who all left the field when an emergency call came in.Our guests are booked – Dean Ashton to preview Norwich v West Ham, Brian Deane on Sheffield United among others.It’s 8.47am. Tony Cascarino – host of the Weekend Sports Breakfast – pokes his head out of the studio to tell us the sad news about Jack Charlton. It won’t be announced until 9am. We have 10 minutes to cancel our plans and set up a show to pay tribute to Big Jack – one of 11 men to win the World Cup for England, and who transformed the game in Ireland.Cascarino has to go back on air, and run through a Premier League preview, despite knowing that his friend and one of the biggest influences of his career has just died. Landlines that haven’t rung for weeks ring. Has someone made an obituary? Where is it saved? Will it be ready in nine minutes? Pre-made obituaries seem slightly cold and callous. There are meetings about who might die in the next few weeks, months or years. Anyone renowned and approaching 80 has a ready-made obit on the shelf – whether in print or packaged up for TV and radio.It’s 8.51am. To my shame, there’s so much I don’t know about Jack Charlton. I knew he was part of that Leeds side – but not that he was a one-club man. I knew nothing of his short-lived stint as a miner, nor of his managerial achievements at Middlesbrough or Sheffield Wednesday.It’s 8.59am. We break the news. Meanwhile, producers have the unenviable task of trying to get in touch with potential guests. I genuinely don’t know if we have the right to be the bearers of this news. We contact Mick McCarthy. He graciously agrees to come on. It is hard to hear him tell us that our message “knocked him sideways”.Mick is on hold while Shane, an Irishman who’s called in, talks about sharing a joke with Jack on a plane. “He was a great man, I know there’ll be a lot of people in tears and in mourning – he was the best thing to happen to us.”The whole tone of the programme is set by Cascarino – who stays with us after his show has finished. He is joined by Ray Houghton and they tell some wonderful stories, touched with humour and love. Ray’s voice cracks. Suddenly it feels like we’re in a pub remembering a mate – not getting all the facts right, but it doesn’t matter.“We ended up going to Harry Ramsden’s the day before a game and doing the Harry Ramsden’s challenge,” says Cas. “It was giant fish ’n’ chips and sausage and pie – the whole team ate it and we played, was it Liechtenstein? I think it was Liechtenstein?”“No, we actually lost 3-1 to Poland the following day at Lansdowne Road,” Houghton interjects. “In Harry Ramsden’s at that time there was this massive big fish and if you finished it you got it for nothing and Gary Kelly finished the lot off – and he got absolutely mullered the next day by Toni Polster – ah that’s right it was Austria. Did he get a hat-trick?”“I can’t remember but he didn’t have to do much,” replies Cas. “We couldn’t move,” shouts Ray.It feels like the laughter echoes out of the studio. It turns out Polster got two in that 3-1 win after Cascarino and Houghton had combined to put Ireland 1-0 up early in the second half. The affection in their voices is joyous.Barry Glendenning comes on. He is genuinely moved. Those who listen to the  Football Weekly have rarely heard his emotional side – nor have those who’ve worked with him for the best part of a decade. “He wasn’t just admired. He was loved. The day we beat England in Stuttgart in 1988 is still one of the greatest days of my life. I’m kind of surprised by how affected I am.”It takes moments like this to realise what sport is really for. What the actual point is. When you step back for one moment. Amid the hours and hours of mindless transfer gossip, fake rage about VAR, and where shoulders begin and arms end. Added to real concern about where the money comes from and where it goes. And real rage about the racism and homophobia that doesn’t end.But why do any of us love sport? It’s our memories of moments, of times spent with family and friends – where we were, who we were with, what we did. It moves us and it defines so much of us – more than we probably realise.Jack Charlton moved so many in life. And even this Saturday morning, hours after he has passed away in his sleep, he is moving us again.It’s 11am. Game day begins. Football stopped for a pandemic, but it doesn’t stop for one man. I am thankful to all those people who came on, despite their sadness, to express themselves so well. I hope, in a tiny way, we did Big Jack justice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29fbe1e8ddf81ae748b68b8df055811d3152dbbf/0_206_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8db19a3b1df037a81a78c30bb1dedd4c","title":"mexico coronavirus municipalities of hope","story":"More than 300 towns free of Covid-19 were allowed to reopen in May to mitigate the pandemic’s economic cost. With cases surging, most have been forced to closeAs the coronavirus pandemic advances across Mexico, leaving thousands dead in its wake, Tepango de Rodríguez has – so far – remained untouched.The town of about 4,000 people sits high in the mountains of the Sierra Norte in Puebla state, and was quick to apply strict preventive measures, closing its food market and installing health checkpoints.“The local health councillor put in a lot of effort to remind people to stay home and use face masks,” said Ismael Domínguez Ruiz, a historian who runs a Facebook page in the town. “She was practically going door-to-door to remind people what to do.”In May, Tepango de Rodríguez was included on a list of 324 towns that the Mexican government decided were eligible to reopen early, as part of a program called “Municipalities of Hope”.The plan allowed places with no Covid-19 cases – and with no cases in surrounding areas – to start lifting restrictions, in an attempt to mitigate the shutdown’s devastating economic impact.But less than two months later, Mexico has become one of the worst-affected countries in the world, with at least 311,000 cases and 36,000 deaths. And the list of Municipalities of Hope has dwindled to a few dozen.One town – Ometepec, Guerrero, lasted less than 14 days on the list. “In just a few weeks, we went from zero to 47 confirmed cases and six dead,” said Ulíses Moreno Tavárez, who lives in the town.According to Dr Carlos Magis Rodríguez, a professor of medicine and a public health researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, a lack of serious lockdown measures doomed the strategy from the beginning. “If there were strict control of entrances and exits, a quarantine upon arrival, it could have worked,” Magis Rodríguez said. “The places this has worked are practically islands.”The shutdown of the country’s capital has further complicated matters, sending thousands of potential carriers back to rural areas. Even in remote towns where residents installed their own health checkpoints, “they block entrances to block visitors with the virus – but not to residents who returned from Mexico City,” said Magis Rodríguez.Across Latin America, poor families have faced an impossible choice – between obeying quarantine measures and starving, or venturing out to work despite the danger of infection.But unlike other leaders, Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has not introduced stimulus measures to help the most vulnerable population, instead pushing through a string of severe austerity measures – even as he emphasized the need for the economy to stay open.The president, popularly known as Amlo, has also downplayed the pandemic – claiming in April that Mexico had “tamed” the virus – and repeatedly emphasized the need for the economy to stay open, striking a notably more relaxed tone than warnings from the country’s Covid-19 tsar, Hugo López-Gatell.This week, López-Gatell expressed concerns about the virus’s resurgence in areas that had reopened too quickly – only to be contradicted by the president, who insisted that “going out to the street is necessary, if we earn our living on the street”.Mexico has one of the lowest testing rates in the world, at approximately 2.5 tests per confirmed case, compared with the US rate of 12.52, the UK’s 22.57 – and New Zealand’s rate of 359.2.Officials have admitted that lack of testing contributes to an undercounting of Covid cases and deaths, even in the country’s capital.But even as they were allowed to reopen, most of the Municipalities of Hope had not applied Covid tests.Nearly all of them were small, rural towns with limited transportation and health infrastructure, but the same factors that slowed the virus’s arrival also make it difficult to identify and treat Covid-19.Even in towns with hospitals, local health infrastructures do not guarantee a speedy testing response.“Here, they only test you if you have quite intense symptoms,” said Moreno Tavárez, who in May was tested at the local health center in Ometepec after experiencing Covid symptoms.“They take the tests from here all the way to Acapulco, and they only send you results if you are positive, leaving everyone else who is tested in suspense.”After several weeks of self-treatment, Moreno Tavárez recovered fully. He assumed he hadn’t had Covid. On 30 June he finally received a positive result.The town of Juchitán was the last in the Pacific coast state of Guerrero to maintain its status as a Municipality of Hope. In late June, cases were diagnosed in neighbouring towns – but by then life in the town had returned to normal, with open stores, schools and restaurants.“People are already careless about it,” said Edgar Liborio Huerta, who works as a construction company administrator in the town of roughly 2,000. “Very few people use face masks.”No Juchitán residents have yet been diagnosed with Covid-19 – not least because patients would have to go to a hospital either in Acapulco, about three hours away, or Ometepec, a 40-minute drive away, for testing.Nonetheless, there are rumours of covid deaths. Elizabeth Liborio Magaña, a Juchitán resident, said that a relative of her husband was one of the suspected cases. “He had asthma problems and they were acting up,” she said. “He got a fever and died of respiratory failure, but they haven’t said if it was because of covid.”To ward off their own outbreak, Juchitan’s authorities continue to take preventive measures. They cancelled the town’s patron saint festivals, usually held in July and August, which tend to attract visitors from all over the region.Meanwhile, the struggle between health and solvency continues. “We have to go back slowly to normal,” said Liborio Huerta. “It’s not because the pandemic is over, but because of the economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ecd8944d05d77e5c09b1c7e367989d257a3a7d6/0_0_4917_2949/master/4917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3728327d9a335257e899046df7077af0","title":"thank you our glorious revolution activists react as sudan ditches islamist laws","story":"After 30 years under Omar al-Bashir, the country has abolished several discriminatory policies and banned FGM – in what activists have called ‘great first steps’ towards liberalisationSudan’s transitional government has been praised for its latest reforms, which decriminalise apostasy, ban female genital mutilation (FGM) and end the requirement for women to get travel permits.The legislation makes major strides in pushing back against discrimination faced by women and minorities during the 30-year rule of Omar al-Bashir that came to an end in 2019, according to equality advocates.The anti-torture charity Redress and the Sudan-based African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies said the measures “move Sudan a step closer towards eliminating structural violence against women and minorities”.“We encourage the new government to continue making domestic law and policy reforms until systematic torture is eradicated from the country and justice and reparations are fully realised for victims,” said Charlie Loudon, Redress’s international legal adviser.Justice Minister Nasredeen Abdulbari announced last week that apostasy, which had been used against religious minorities and was punishable by death, would no longer be an offence. In addition, he said, non-Muslims will be allowed to drink alcohol in private.Abdulbari called the reforms “a big stride towards establishing one of the foundations for the victorious December revolution’s slogans, which is freedom”.Sudan’s infamous apostasy laws were highlighted by the case of Meriam Ibrahim, who was raised by a Christian mother, but sentenced to death by a Sudanese court for abandoning Islam, the faith of her father. Ibrahim was freed in 2018 after an international outcry.The reforms follow the abolition in late 2019 of the notorious Public Order Act. Article 152 of the law included the punishment of 40 lashes for women who wore trousers in public. Fagiri had previously claimed that 45,000 women were prosecuted under the Public Order Act in 2016 alone. Ola Diab, the editor of the online Sudanese cultural magazine 500 Words, said the reforms were “great first steps”.“The issue here is implementation of these laws. I think that’s where the challenge will be and where we’ll see if these laws will really bring serious change,” said Diab, noting that she expected social resistance to reforms such as the ban on FGM.She added that many other laws needed to change, including those that have seen victims of rape prosecuted on adultery charges and women in mixed-sex settings accused of prostitution.Loudon said Sudan must ensure steps are taken to enforce the legal changes.“That would be things like amending the internal policies of the relevant government agencies, whether the police, the general intelligence services or the armed forces.“The other thing that would be crucial would be training being put in place,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/144a52b7a2218ae26ef8b7a4f2b8f762bcd92aca/0_0_2517_1512/master/2517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fe8b8535b8184abcff9e2e72a2342ed","title":"coronavirus immigration pandemic new york glasgow","story":"I was used to living in a different country from my family. But the pandemic has made us realise we might not see each other for yearsI miss my mother. She lives in Glasgow, and I live in New York City. Before our respective cities got locked down, this distance was business as usual for us. With a parent from either side of the Atlantic, I’ve always had family members living in both the US and the UK. But business as usual was when borders were open. Now, like millions of other people who live in different countries from their relatives, we’re trying to cope with the knowledge that we may not see each other for years.We’ve had the privilege of seeing immigration as a force for good in our families: for opportunity, adventure, variety. But now, we’re reconsidering our choices in ways that we’ve never imagined we would.Like so many of the personal sadnesses of the pandemic, it’s hard to reflect on this without acknowledging the good fortune we have in the grand scheme of things: we’ve stayed healthy, we’re not in danger of losing our homes. Many of us who are struggling with not being able to see our families in other countries are struggling because a huge luck that we’ve long taken for granted has disappeared. When we moved, or said goodbye to our relatives as they crossed borders, we did so under the assumption that we’d always be free to travel. We know that our particular pandemic predicament is far from the worst problem. But it’s still a big problem.For people who’ve always lived near their relatives, it might seem like my family isn’t close. I have two siblings, and at one point we were all living at least 3,000 miles away from our parents. But families like ours will recognize that our inclination towards distance is a kind of closeness in itself: by going away we were being unoriginal, following in the footsteps of our parents, who themselves both were immigrants when they were young. When you grow up with people who are out of place, sometimes there’s nothing more comfortable than being somewhere you feel foreign. My siblings and I had confidence to seek adventure in far-flung destinations because we knew that our parents had flourished when they migrated – and because we knew that we could always go home.I was sad when my mother moved back to Scotland after my father died, but I understood why she chose to. I’d just returned to the US after living abroad for many years, so I could relate to feeling pulled back to the country where you were born. When my mother left, I also understood that we’d visit. She was there when my son was born 19 months ago, just as my Scottish grandmother was present for my birth in New York in the early 1980s, taking her first flight at the age of 74. When I was growing up, return visits were rarer. It was a huge, expensive undertaking to get us all across the Atlantic in that era. My parents cut corners elsewhere in our lives to make it possible: experiencing another country and culture was a gift.I was happy to believe that my son would get to experience that, too. We had it so much easier: flying was less momentous. Phone calls were no longer special treats rationed for birthdays and holidays. There was always the next visit to look forward to.Until there wasn’t. It turns out that not being able to make any plan at all is the crux of the problem. It turns out that having plans were what kept us feeling hopeful, and close, and not filled with longing and terrible thoughts about the future that can’t be said. Why, we ask on our calls, did we do this to ourselves? Of course we know that many families are separated within countries, too, but still the possibility of domestic travel seems more promising. I can picture my family driving 1,000 miles to Florida to see my father-in-law, if that’s what it takes. It’s harder to imagine a world in which it will feel safe for my mum to get on a plane, much less one where the UK is welcoming to visitors from the global leader in Covid-19 cases.We were complacent: that’s the truth. My Jewish great-grandparents, refugees who emigrated to the United States from Russia and Lithuania, didn’t have a hope of ever seeing the family members that they left behind. Their children, my American grandparents, only spoke English: what was the point of learning languages useful in places that they’d never return to? The truth is that before the pandemic there were millions of families making the same excruciating decisions as my great-grandparents. Families like mine felt sorry for them, maybe campaigned for them, or donated money to organizations to help them. But we didn’t relate: to us, immigration was about fluidity, not permanent parting.Since the lockdown began I’ve FaceTimed my mum with my son most days: the bright side of being at home means that it’s easier to find mutually agreeable times to speak than it was when I used to go to the office. Now, my son knows who Granny is: we say her name and he points to my iPhone. We talk about what he’s been learning, and we talk about the weather, and we talk about politics – which government is worse today? Which leader most stupid and careless? We talk about a future in which we’ll be together again, but we don’t really talk about dates, or seasons, or years. My mother is doing OK, under the circumstances. Under the circumstances, so are we. But we miss her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c76937dcae0f711ba47376d0d3a9f80dd4298c45/0_42_2576_1546/master/2576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ba66e6c4cd879ffc9a7e784d52dd8ca","title":"the power of touch i miss football hugs now i long for a fetid boozy embrace","story":"Hugging your fellow fans is an act of extraordinary, unlikely bonding.

Fans of the Polish club Lech Poznań introduced it to Manchester City supporters during a Europa League match in 2010. They turned their backs on the game, wrapped their arms around the shoulders of the supporters on either side of them and repeatedly jumped up and down on the spot in unison. It was a beautiful sight – random, surreal, rhythmic, funny, collective – and utterly senseless.The history of the Poznań is much debated. Some say it started in Poland in the early 60s as a protest by fans against club management others say it originated in Turkey and Greece, and was known as the Grecque. For Manchester City fans, though, it will always be known as the Poznań. After that match against Lech Poznań, we paid homage to its supporters by stealing their crazy hug-dance. We customised it by chanting “Let’s all do the Poznań” to the tune of Do the Conga.It was open to any number of meanings or none. We Poznańed in triumph after scoring, we Poznańed when we were bored, we Poznańed when we were rubbish. Turning our back on the football could be interpreted as supreme confidence (we knew we would win), despair (we knew we would lose) or indifference. Sod the footie, we were there for the craic. It was ludicrous, but it was also an act of love, trust and solidarity. A Poznań did not allow for party-poopers or mavericks (even though it was a maverick act). If one person broke the chain, the Poznań was ruined.Even pre-lockdown the football hug was in danger of disappearing. VAR (the video assistant referee) has taken the spontaneity out of football: rather than hugging when our team scored, we started checking the TV screens to see if a goal really was a goal or just another shattered hope.Meanwhile, the pandemic has robbed us of the opportunity to Poznań. Indeed, common sense may dictate that we never see it again. But football being football, and City fans being City fans, I have a sneaky feeling that when we are finally allowed back into football grounds, we may just celebrate with the most audacious, prolonged Poznań ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abd4a87765f892fc784ccf95c7cf1fddd32028c7/0_182_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78cf4eaf7ecd552d8c7ba318b627c20c","title":"rents rise in england but slide in london as covid 19 affects market","story":"Property website Rightmove said rents outside London hit record £845 a month in early JulyRents have continued to climb across England, but they are sliding in London as Airbnb owners abandon hopes of attracting holidaymakers and put their properties on the long-term rental market.The Rightmove data records asking prices for new properties to rent on its website, and is more volatile than figures from the Office for National Statistics.Rightmove director, Miles Shipside, said: “The pause in the rental market has led to some distorted figures over the past few months, especially in cities where landlords with short-term lets made the swap to instead try to find a long-term tenant.”He predicted that the legacy of coronavirus will be more tenants seeking a spare room and a garden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c7fdb070b7277ccc22eb633bb21ff3fef299e1/0_1800_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=afb06ff1dbb672715f78960920543dcf","title":"family fortunes of wealthy increase as super rich ride coronavirus storm","story":"More than three-quarters of the world’s richest people have reported an increase in their already vast family fortunes, despite the economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Research into the family offices of the super-rich found that the vast majority were able to “ride out 2020’s storm in financial markets”, while many less wealthy people have lost their jobs and seen the value of their savings and pensions collapse.Of the 121 family offices included in the survey, 93 had met or exceeded their financial targets in the year to May 2020. They achieved this despite most countries in the world suffering their worst economic contractions in decades. Some 24 of the family offices in the survey managed private fortunes of more than $3bn.Josef Stadler, head of UBS’s ultra-high net worth unit, said the world’s richest people had been able to increase their fortunes during the crisis because they had enough money to “embrace and manage risk like no other investor”.“They stick to their plans, even when market volatility makes it uncomfortable. They hold their position. They are disciplined,” Stadler said. “It is missing an opportunity that gives these clients the biggest headache, not making a short-term loss.”The rising fortunes of the super-wealthy come as separate research shows that it is the poorest people in society who are mostly likely to be losing their jobs and suffering the biggest percentage fall in income.Ana Arendar, head of inequality campaigns at Oxfam, said: “Whilst those with great wealth are able to reallocate their investments to insulate themselves from the economic impacts of Covid-19, most poor people in developing and developed countries cannot take similar action to protect their limited wealth.“Wealth inequalities were already too high before the crisis and action is needed to ensure the gap does not grow further.”Family offices – which were pioneered by the Rockerfeller family in the late 19th century to preserve their wealth for future generations – are also used by wealthy people to run homes and staff across the world and to look after private jets, super-yachts and other accoutrements.The number of super-rich people continues to grow despite the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person and the founder of Amazon, has seen his fortune swell by $75bn so far this year to a record $189bn.More than 500,000 people in the world are classed as “ultra-wealthy”, with fortunes of more than $30m (£26.5m). That means there are more ultra-wealthy people than the populations of Iceland, Malta or Belize.This week, a group of more than 80 millionaires called on governments permanently to increase taxes on them and other members of the wealthy elite to help pay for the economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e64853270418239725248e64d757ab564f4497d8/0_50_1805_1083/master/1805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=764e6f817deaebb90bc3d07aa622b7af","title":"is uk golden era relations china over podcast","story":"China and the UK have clashed in recent months over a draconian new security law in Hong Kong and the Chinese tech company Huawei. ’s Tania Branigan examines whether a much-promoted ‘golden era’ between the two countries is at an end In 2015 George Osborne, the then chancellor, promised a ‘golden decade’ for Chinese-British relations as he drummed up support for new trade opportunities and inward investment.

The report is expected to be published next Wednesday, it is understood.His comments will pitch Lewis, a long standing supporter of Brexit and the armed forces, against Boris Johnson’s advisers who wished to impose Grayling upon the committee. The committee is regularly briefed by the security services and considers some of Parliament’s most sensitive information.Lewis was expelled from the parliamentary Conservative party on Wednesday after securing the prestigious ISC chairmanship with the support of opposition members.The committee confirmed on Thursday it would publish the report into Russian interference in UK politics before the summer recess.In a statement, Lewis said the 2013 Justice and Security Act explicitly removed the right of the prime minister to choose the ISC chairman and gave it to the committee members.“It was only yesterday afternoon that I received a text asking me to confirm that I would be voting for the prime minister’s preferred candidate for the ISC chair,” he said.“I did not reply as I considered it an improper request. At no earlier stage did I give any undertaking to vote for any particular candidate,” he said.A senior government source had explained Lewis’s ejection from the party by saying he “has been told by the chief whip that it is because he worked with Labour and other opposition MPs for his own advantage”.Johnson nominated five Conservative MPs for the committee last week – giving them a majority – and Grayling was widely expected to become chair.Sources said he and the government were “surprised” by Lewis’s decision to stand.Lewis, the MP for New Forest East since 1997, has twice chaired the House of Commons’ defence select committee. He was described by the former national security adviser Peter Ricketts as someone “with much wider experience of defence and security”.In Thursday’s statement, Lewis said Johnson had no right to dictate who chairs the committee.“The 2013 Justice and Security Act explicitly removed the right of the prime minister to choose the ISC chairman and gave it to committee members. I remember this well as I served on the committee from 2010 to 2015,” he said.“There is no other Conservative MP in the House of Commons with any past experience of working on the ISC.”Lewis’s chairmanship has paved the way for the Russia report, which was sent to Downing Street in October, to finally be released.The report includes evidence from UK intelligence services concerning Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election.Following speculation the new committee chair, who was widely expected to be Grayling, could delay it further or rewrite it, a short statement from the committee said it would be released within days.A spokesperson for the ISC said: “The committee has unanimously agreed this morning that it will publish the report on Russia prepared by its predecessor before the house rises for the summer recess.”The government could seek to remove Lewis from the ISC by tabling a motion to replace him in the Commons, which MPs would have to approve.This tactic could run into trouble. Lewis has many allies on the Tory benches, including those who support increased defence spending.One senior backbench MP told the  Lewis had charm, a quality that many of Johnson’s advisers lack. “Julian Lewis knows how to work the tearoom in a way that Dominic Cummings, who has insulted most MPs at one time or another, has never quite worked out.“When he stood to become chair of the defence committee, he would produce his own handmade leaflets – including photos of himself wearing Navy uniform – and walk MPs to the voting booths with a smile and a pat on the back. People like him.”The Conservative MP Peter Bone accused Downing Street of having a “huge hissy fit” over Lewis who is “exceptionally well qualified” and will do an “excellent job”.In the Commons, Bone asked if there would be an attempt to remove the new chair.“Will the Leader of the House confirm that he will not bring forward a motion to remove (Mr Lewis) from the ISC?” Bone said.Unlike previous chairs of the committee, the former transport secretary Grayling had little experience of security matters and was dubbed “failing Grayling” for a series of policy blunders during his time in government.The former Tory cabinet minister and ex-chairman of the intelligence and security committee, Dominic Grieve, told BBC’s Newsnight: “What troubles me about this episode – quite apart from its utter absurdity, and now withdrawing the whip from Julian, who is indeed highly respected – is the mindset it gives about what on earth is going on in Downing Street.“Why did they try to manipulate this process? They shouldn’t have done.“The committee can only exist, the committee can only be respected ... if it is seen to be non-partisan and independent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae4c4d8a833b8b7a0abaaf11930e94edf6a02676/0_181_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ef2ec84b62d568ec0a0b2b85e6e3779","title":"sunaks covid 19 package recycled up to 10bn spending ifs","story":"Chancellor’s statement ‘corrosive of public trust’ for passing old funds off as newRishi Sunak has been accused of repackaging up to £10bn of previously announced government spending to form the backbone of his summer statement plan to save jobs during Covid-19.Serving the chancellor with a blunt rebuke, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said it was “corrosive to public trust” for the government to reallocate old funds and pass them off as new money.It said at least £8bn and up to a third of the £30bn coronavirus response package announced by Sunak in his summer statement last week would be funded from underspending on previously planned projects.David Phillips, an associate director at the IFS, said: “It makes scrutiny of plans more difficult and is corrosive to trust. While governments of all stripes will, of course, want to follow the adage of ‘repetition, repetition, repetition’ when it comes to highlighting the goodies they are funding, official policy documents should also be clear about when and where spending is expected to be lower than previously planned too.”The country’s leading tax and spending thinktank said the package of up to £30bn unveiled by the chancellor included £5.5bn in transport and infrastructure projects announced by Boris Johnson, that was in fact money reallocated from other schemes.The government has been clear that the infrastructure package announced in the prime minister’s “new deal” speech was from old money, representing instead the acceleration of previously planned investments.However, the IFS also said the £2bn “green homes grant” announced by Sunak to help insulate Britain’s energy-inefficient homes had been allocated from previously announced spending, and that £400m for traineeships, apprenticeships, school leavers and careers advice in England was from an existing funding pot.The IFS said the discrepancy emerged because the UK’s devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were in line to receive less money than would have been the case if the chancellor’s spending package were entirely new.It said the Scottish government would have got about about £750m via the Barnett formula – the system for allocating the share of new public spending to the devolved administrations – if the funds were new. Instead, Scotland will receive about £21m.The IFS said reductions in spending on other areas, as some previously planned projects and investments are deemed less of a priority or infeasible given the coronavirus crisis, was a reasonable way to manage the public finances. However, it warned that a lack of transparency over where spending was now expected to be lower had contributed to confusion about the scale of the fiscal support being provided.Phillips said: “A lack of illumination leaves significant scope for misunderstanding and even misrepresentation of the UK government’s plans. So, can the UK government please turn on the lights?”A Treasury spokesperson said: “This suggestion is wrong. The Treasury has approved additional activity by departments as part of the plan for jobs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f2209648c1c203d9971562c0d0c4ffa96d00294/0_228_5457_3273/master/5457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e291ca5ebedbea3aafd3638c97d886ef","title":"a post pandemic guide for retailers think of your customers as your biggest fans","story":"Lockdown has shown us that people will support the brands they want to succeed – a business expert’s advice to store ownersThe retail sector has been in flux for some time and, post coronavirus, there’s more uncertainty to come.“There is a lot of talk about ‘returning to normal’ or of the ‘new normal’, but prior to the pandemic the only normal was that everything was changing,” says business consultant Neil Gibb. The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

Not only does the jab trigger the production of antibodies – proteins that can bind to the virus, preventing it from entering cells and flagging it to immune cells – but it also seems to result in the production of “killer” T cells – immune cells that attack infected human cells.“Virtually any vaccine inevitably does this,” Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at the Imperial College London, told the . Dr Zania Stamataki, a senior lecturer in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham, said questions remained, but the findings were prompting sighs of relief among immunologists. “What we do know, is that the vaccines are able to elicit the right type of immune response. This is a very encouraging sign,” she said.The results offer further hope that the Oxford vaccine could work against Covid-19. “When immunologists study protective immunity against any pathogen, they’re actually studying many different readouts from different cell types and mediators of the immune system. It can be hard to define, of all these, which is the absolute ‘correlate of protection’ – the level your vaccine would need to attain to maximise protection,” said Altmann.“The results from Oxford yesterday add some detail to this discussion, with the good news that the two most obviously key parts of immune protection are effectively induced: antibodies that can neutralise virus entry, and T cells that can recognise and attack infected cells.”It is not the only vaccine that appears to trigger both antibody and T-cell responses: a different type of vaccine, produced by the US company Moderna and based on viral RNA, also appears to stimulate both paths.So far, that is unclear, and some scientists have been unwilling to comment on the findings on the Oxford vaccine, at least until the full study is published in the Lancet on Monday. But one thing is for sure: there is still a long way to go to show that the Oxford vaccine can guard against Covid-19, despite hopes that it could be ready by September. “The big next steps will be to head into appraisal of actual protection,” said Altmann.Stamataki agreed, noting that the two key questions were whether the immune responses generated by the various vaccines under development can protect against severe disease, and if so, for how long.One issue is that recent studies have found that antibodies in people who have had Covid-19 drop off steeply over a three-month period after infection. A key question is whether the same drop off is seen in antibodies triggered by the vaccine.Altmann said both the Moderna and Oxford vaccines triggered an immune response in a different way to natural infection, meaning this would not necessarily be expected. But even if antibodies do wane, the body might still be able to produce them much faster next time, while T cell response tends to last longer and so might offer longer-lasting protection. “The duration of antibody and T cell responses is different for every vaccine and cannot be predicted accurately,” Stamataki said. “It is also different for any natural infection, so we have to wait and see how long our volunteers carry antibodies and T cells specific for Sars-CoV-2.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a492d40bbfa7cbd79f24dc3ccd20d124a8f076/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16fc2f8e0e3130406cd8cc8929d5db88","title":"have you become unemployed due to coronavirus","story":"Following news that almost 650,000 people have left company payrolls since March, we would like to hear from those who have lost their jobs due to coronavirusThe number of people on company payrolls in the UK has dropped by almost 650,000 since March, as unemployment continues to soar due to the coronavirus pandemic.We would like to hear from people who have lost their jobs as a result of coronavirus over the last three months.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64213eecf0c7d15eb8217111d7d08bae6113f645/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ba6051a6cdd088cff23359cab35cc52","title":"safe flight spotless hotel and masks everywhere canaries reopen to tourism","story":"With their low infection rate, the islands are being used as a laboratory for safe tourism. Joining a trial flight with the UN’s World Tourism Organization, we find Fuerteventura organised, welcoming and very cleanOn Wednesday 8 July, a plane with around 180 people on board left Madrid for Gran Canaria. This was not any old charter, as its “safe flight” passengers included Zurab Pololikashvili, secretary general of the UN’s World Tourism Organization María Reyes Maroto, Spain’s minister for industry, trade, and tourism a smattering of health workers being rewarded for their services during the Covid-19 crisis, travel PR and trade professionals, and journalists.What made this flight safer than others? Although very much in the beta stage and yet to be made compulsory, it was a trial for the Digital Health Passport aka hi+card, which may become the blueprint for a global health passport. This is designed to ensure that travellers enter and leave destinations infection-free, by giving them a PCR test in advance, with the results sent to their phone. While the measurement of blood pressure and temperature was pretty straightforward, the nasal swabbing felt vaguely disconcerting, not unlike the new normality in fact.On a plane where every passenger was wearing a mask, Iwas in an aisle seat and a health worker was in the window seat: there was an empty middle seat between us. In terms of social distancing, I couldn’t imagine feeling much safer.It was much the same, at our first stop, Fuerteventura’s Morro Jable in the south of that island, which resembles an out-of-season UK resort, with bars, restaurants, and even Burger King closed. Four-star Lemon \u0026amp Soul Cactus Garden hotel had been open since 8 July and felt as eerily quiet as the unbroken 26km stretch of vanilla sand nearby. Here, and in other hotels, guests have to use the lifts inidually unless they’re sharing a room, and follow a one-way route around the restaurant to avoid unnecessary contact with fellow visitors. There is hand sanitiser everywhere. Everything seems spotlessly clean. At the pool bar I meet two of the hotel’s first returning British tourists: Coventry couple Trevor and Claire. They tell me they didn’t contemplate a staycation as they wanted “to rest and relax in better weather than the UK guarantees” after spending lockdown looking after elderly dependents. They say they have been further heartened by the warm welcome from the staff. “They were like: you’re English? No problem. We can get you a kettle.” This can-do attitude is exemplified by Noelia Delgado, the hotel’s cheery manager.Her boss at the Meeting Point Hotels group, Bernardo Losada, tells me all about the group’s partnership with hygiene labs and international standards companiesto secure a POSI (Prevention of Spread of Infection) certification for each hotel, and how there’s a daily room check assurance tag for every new guest.”Stringency is a byword on the other side of the island too, in northerly Corralejo. Nightclubs might be thought of as doomed in these times, but Ian Downs, owner of the resort’s Reflex Disco, says groups inside are limited to eight people, and adding an outside terrace has improved the user experience. “Most businesses here are following guidelines and that is having a positive impact on people seeing Corralejo as a safe destination.”The Canaries as a whole have positioned themselves as a “global laboratory for safe tourism”, the slogan Fortress Canaries reflecting the fact that this is one of Spain’s least-affected regions. There have been no coronavirus-related deaths on Fuerteventura, but lockdown was tough. Carlos Ortega, the civil servant charged with creating a new safety protocol for leisure companies, tells me: “Tourism brings €7m to the archipelago every single day, and 300,000 families on the islands depend on this industry as a source of income. The Canary Islands’ plan A is tourism.”Under his protocol, Fuerteventura has had to cut capacity on popular pirate-ship excursions and at the many aloe vera farms, whose product is used in hand sanitiser. “We will reactivate tourism as soon as possible as our high season is winter,” Ortega says.Another passenger on my “safe flight”, Suman Billa, UNWTO’s technical director, says the Canaries had contacted UNWTO for their expertise, and that lessons learned from their trial return to tourism could apply to other holiday regions. “The archipelago is a good fit as it’s a fairly controllable environment.”The Canaries have always offered sun, sand and safety. A few years ago, their serene reputation recaptured consumers disinclined to trust more volatile destinations affected by the Arab Spring. The only mild discomfort is the mask mandatory in all communal indoor and external areas where the safety distance of 1.5 metres is impossible to maintain or you are engaged in drinking or eating. But this just makes the great outdoors even more appealing, especially the golden miles of sandy beaches, which on Fuerteventura seem longer and wider than anywhere else in Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe4c177ac196e0d48d468fc616fd7c39f49fd8b/19_0_3462_2077/master/3462.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d3bb927a30416adddf615be41a38525","title":"democrats joe biden nervously optimistic blue wave","story":"Joe Biden is polling well ahead of Donald Trump, potentially putting more states in play – but complacency has been banishedLess than four months out from the November election, the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has been consistently polling ahead of Donald Trump.The president’s approval numbers remain underwater, and Democrats believe they can seriously compete in traditionally red states including Texas, as Trump faces sustained criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis linked to it, as well as the ongoing anti-racism protests against police brutality.For Democrats, these are not the only indicators that things are going well. Infighting between the progressive wing of the party and the establishment wing has been relatively minimal, as they come together to focus on Biden’s campaign to push Trump out of the White House.Some top party officials are feeling ambitious, and want to ride another potential “blue wave” to try to win races that are usually out of reach in states like Georgia and Ohio. But there’s a strain of caution running through the Democratic party as well. Things looked great for them for a while in 2016, too, but Republicans ended up with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, and the memory of that cataclysmic loss is still fresh.“I mean, we are emotionally and mentally scarred in such a way that we are not going to feel comfortable until a week after Biden is sworn in,” said the Democratic strategist Tom Bowen.In any election cycle, campaign officials use cautious phrases like “we’re not leaving anything to chance” or “campaigning like we’re 10 points down until election day” – and the 2020 presidential race is no different. But coupled with that is an argument that Trump’s case for re-election is not reaching the voters he needs to.The memo went on to tick off the problems with each of Trump’s arguments.On Tuesday, in another sign that Democrats see a rare opening to compete in what are usually Republican strongholds, the Biden campaign began airing a 60-second general election ad in Texas, fueled by a six-figure ad buy. That ad is the first in a $15m multi-state blitz in six battleground states – Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona.Meanwhile, the pro-Trump America First Action Super Pac is pouring $23m into Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and Wisconsin but not Michigan – a state that Trump needs to win re-election. Trump himself has been campaigning over the last few months in reliably red states. Private polling for Republicans also shows the president in trouble in what are usually reliably conservative states.All of which suggests Democrats have the upper hand over Republicans. But Democratic state officials and operatives expect polls to tighten and the summer high to end. In multiple interviews, these officials were hopeful but also realistic that the next few months won’t be easy.Democrats often cite 2016, where polls showed Hillary Clinton as the clear favorite to win the presidency. At that time, and again now, some Democrats also felt retaking control of the Senate was possible.“I’m not going to argue that there isn’t some anxiety there, and I think that 2016 put that in our being because we were feeling very secure that we would have a Democratic president, and things changed so rapidly,” said the Kansas Democratic party chairwoman, Vicki Hiatt.Democrats are hoping to win a US Senate seat in Kansas this cycle, which would usually be unheard of. “I think over the past three and a half years we’ve seen some very unpredictable things happen that we would never have expected. I think that is where that anxiety comes from. For me personally, I’m not going to rest until we have this thing done. I’m cautiously optimistic but I’m not taking anything for granted.”From September, Biden and Trump will face each other in three televised debates, something Republican campaign officials hope the president will be able to dominate. Democrats are also expecting some kind of “October surprise” from the Trump campaign and a barrage of warnings about Democratic control of the White House and Congress.“That tightening will happen. It’s natural. So what we need to be doing is building up our reserves now,” said the Maryland Democratic party chairwoman, Yvette Lewis. “So we can’t waste time right now worrying about the what-ifs.”The Tennessee Democratic party chairwoman, Mary Mancini, said that Republicans have not yet thrown their full offensive force against Democratic candidates this cycle.“Now what they could do and what they’re trying to do is fearmonger their way into winning,” Mancini said. “I think the most damaging and frightening thing is we have yet to see the all-out assault from the Republican party in terms of using fear to motivate voters. We’ve seen a little of it but it’s the tip of the iceberg for the Republican party.”The pandemic has also changed the reality of campaigning for office. More voters will be voting by mail rather than in person, potentially delaying the final results on election night. Trump has argued, contrary to established evidence, that voting by mail is vulnerable to fraud.“I think my greatest fear is what the Republicans do now and over the next few months to delegitimise the election,” said Aryeh Alex, the executive director of the Ohio Democrats’ state house campaign arm.Julian Mulvey, a veteran Democratic ad maker, added: “Every Democrat should be worried. Every Democrat should be nervous because it won’t be over till it’s over. But I think everyone is nervously optimistic right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3223620f04652188e308daee2d0ece145ec57faa/0_297_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b19d93a4f61d520e4d785c217c1f315d","title":"bild zeitung tabloid julian reichelt angela merkel germany","story":"The newspaper Bild has long poured vitriol on the country’s left-wingers and ‘do gooders’. But now it has a new target: the chancellor. By  Thomas Meaney‘It would be ideal if you could hit a deer,” Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Europe’s largest tabloid, Bild Zeitung, told his chauffeur. “ readers could do with a bit more colour.” We had reached escape velocity out of ice-encrusted Düsseldorf. The Mercedes S-Class locked into place like a bobsled on the Autobahn. I sat shotgun with Reichelt’s assortment of sports gear, a hockey stick between my legs. “We are lucky in our driver today,” Reichelt said, deadpan. “Last time we hit a wild boar and the boar and the car went flying.”I was travelling with Reichelt on one of his publicity tours across Germany. For the past two years, he has made an appointment once a month to commune with groups of Bild’s 1.3 million readers. “You have to feel their emotions,” he told me from the backseat. “You have to listen to their hearts.”Reichelt, who is 40, made his name as a war reporter in Syria, but today confines most of his battle courage to Twitter, where he enjoys needling the German political establishment and barging into leftwing echo chambers. In person, Reichelt exudes a twitchy exuberance, like a fighter pilot who has managed to smuggle champagne into the cockpit. His eyes restlessly gauge the world around him, clocking who he needs to avoid and who he needs to attract. Into his phone, he volleys directives to subeditors, assistants and the band of young male disciples he sends around the world to collect stories. “The leading populist in western Germany,” is how Albrecht von Lucke, editor of the prestigious left-liberal monthly Blätter, describes him.For decades, Bild was an object of scorn for any self-respecting West German of social democratic orientation. In a political culture more conformist and decorous than most of its western peers, Bild functioned like the Las Vegas strip, concentrating all of the Federal Republic’s seediness in one place. Seven days a week, Bild pumped free-market mantras, alongside ads for car tyres and chicken wings, into the stiff arteries of cold war West Germany. Bild decried long hair on men and the marriage of its top models to foreigners. It genuflected before South African apartheid, Greek dictatorship, Bavarian sedans and American Pershing missiles. Above all, Bild dedicated itself to the destruction of communist East Germany, and fought a long battle against what it viewed as enemy collaborators in the leftist student movement at home.Such was the stature of Bild in West Germany that in 1965, after the daily rose in price from 10 to 15 pfennigs, Axel Springer, who referred to Bild as his “dog on a chain”, proposed to Chancellor Ludwig Erhard that the state introduce a special 15 pfennig coin to make it easier to purchase the paper. Meanwhile, the East German Stasi was so impressed by Bild as a state propaganda tool that it crafted its own – imaginatively titled – NEUE Bild Zeitung, which was sold at the border with West Germany, where it conspicuously failed to wean class enemies off the original.Today Bild is paradoxically less influential than it was in the 60s, but more politically important. “I read it first in the morning because it is the agenda-setter,” says Josef Joffe, the publisher-editor of the liberal weekly, Die Zeit. “Politicos in Berlin probably read it first in the morning as well.” The paper enjoys a close relationship with the German political elite. The former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, was one of the best men at the wedding of former Bild editor, Kai Diekmann, and in 2008, Diekmann performed the same role for Kohl at his wedding. “Kohl rules with Bild,” the Nobel laureate Heinrich Böll wrote, and Kohl’s successor as chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, affirmed the practice: “To govern I need Bild, Bild Sunday’s edition, and the telly,” he once said.Bild’s intimate relationship with some of Germany’s most powerful figures is a vestige of its days as the country’s decisive reputation maker-and-breaker. The former defence minister, now the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has shown up at one of Reichelt’s dinner parties at the Bild offices in Berlin, and for the past few years Bild has hosted part of the annual Munich Security Conference, the equivalent of Davos for the global defence industry. Although Angela Merkel has not ingratiated herself with the Springer complex — despite receiving early political support from Bild — her husband is nevertheless paid €10,000 a year to grace the board of the nonprofit Friede Springer Foundation, named after Axel Springer’s widow.Despite its traditional proximity to power, Bild has mutated into something beyond a stalwart defender of the German status quo. Now, says Joffe, it is “an equal-opportunity anti-establishment force”. “Previous Bild editors made their alliances more based on personal feeling,” says the journalist Stefan Niggemeier, who in 2004 co-founded the BILDBlog, a website that corrects Bild’s factual errors and misrepresentations. “But Reichelt is different. He is an actually political person.”Reichelt’s agenda is marked less by novelty than by a chest-crunching resuscitation of Bild’s core commitments: pro-US, pro-Nato, pro-Israel, pro-austerity, pro-capital, anti-Russia, anti-China. According to the Bild worldview, the best way to counter the left is to portray its demands as totalitarian, and the best way to kill off the far right is to cannibalise its grievances. While Bild prints relatively little material that a supporter of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party would object to, Reichelt sees the party as a threat to his effort to remake the German political scene. “We want nothing to do with the imbeciles of the AfD,” he told me. “The way to destroy them is to make room for their voters in what used to be the political mainstream of this country.”Bild’s main attack targets remain Germany’s “Gutmenschen” – the do-gooders, vegetarians, Greens and 1968ers who are treated as parasites and irritants to Germany’s robust economy and middle class. More recently, the paper’s sights have also turned on Merkel and her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). “The paper’s constant targeting of Merkel, but also its current take on refugees and all sorts of minorities definitely reproduces rhetorical elements of the AfD,” says Fatma Aydemir, a novelist and columnist for the leftwing daily Tageszeitung, known as Taz. In the absence of serious challenges from within Merkel’s own party, or from other parties – she has been chancellor for 14 years, a tenure surpassed only by Kohl and Bismarck – Bild has attempted to make itself into that opposition. Yet any populist challenger finds itself in the hard position of convincing Germans that Merkel’s very successful form of reactive politics has run out of historical steam. “We are the voice of ordinary people,” claims Reichelt. “If we didn’t exist, they would really think the whole system is against them.”We pulled into the fire station in the proud town of Sprockhövel, about 18 miles north-east of Düsseldorf, where a few dozen people greeted us, most of them in firefighter gear. Bild beer steins, Bild lighters and other Bild paraphernalia had been laid out on the firefighters’ bar. Reichelt marched out to the garage with the fire engines, where a small table stood. He took a sip of beer, and addressed the group with aplomb.“It’s an honour to be among you because, as you know, I like to meet our readers face to face,” Reichelt said. He wanted to know why they had become firefighters. “It’s that feeling that we’re brothers,” said one of the younger firefighters. “That we have each other’s back. You don’t get that feeling elsewhere.” Yes, Reichelt agreed, courage was in short supply in Germany. Courage: that was a virtue Bild could get behind.“The only trouble we have with Bild,” said another, old fireman, “is your picture contest!”Reichelt made a show of pricking up his ears. “Oh really? Is there something we’re doing wrong? I welcome your criticism!”“It encourages people to send in the most sensational photos possible, but people block the way to fires because they’re trying to take photos for Bild!”Reichelt’s face registered the gravity of the charge. He moved like a matador, coaxing anyone else with negative things to say to hurl them at his face. “Look, that’s terrible, and we’ll have to stop that. I’ll get on that immediately,” he told the man who complained about the photo contest.After Reichelt had presided over dinner in the firefighters’ hall, we got back into the Mercedes and sped into the dark. I asked him why he goes out of his way for pow-wows with his readership. “Bild is the last national campfire experience in German life,” he told me. “It’s the last thing that Germans can come together for.” It was a curious way of viewing a newspaper that has, for decades, polarised a country otherwise committed to “consensus politics” into two camps: Bild readers and Bild haters. Yet Reichelt delivered this well-greased lump of Springer-speak with what seemed like sincerity.The experience of reading Bild is a sugar-rush of gossip, accompanied by the clanging gong of headlines. As is traditional, scandals are designated for the front page, but in Bild’s current iteration, fear-mongering appears to be privileged over celebrity soup: “Germany’s most dangerous gang leader is free again” reads a typical headline. Alongside the main stories, the front page also lists the dollar exchange rate and the price of gold, as well as the “winners” and “losers” of the day. A loser might be Prince Charles, whose charity, according to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, may have received dark money from Russians. (“Bild says: black money for blue blood!”) Or a loser might be Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, claiming that there is a “large, coordinated campaign” by the German government to fund misinformation in Russia: “Bild says: what nonsense!” Winners tend to be businessmen making big deals or celebrities being nice to children.The most reliably absurdist section of Bild typically falls on page 3 or 4, with a report from Paul Ronzheimer, Reichelt’s star protege. There one finds Ronzheimer posing in front of a Brazilian forest fire Ronzheimer posing in front of the Venezuelan opposition leader Ronzheimer posing in front of a Hong Kong street fight Ronzheimer posing in front of Syrian refugees Ronzheimer disbursing fake Drachmas to poor Greeks encouraging them to leave Europe. His stories appear as little frames of text under giant, hard-won selfies, as if to declare: Bild was here! “Ronzheimer does have a discernible function,” says von Lucke. “He makes Bild readers feel like they’re reading a paper that has incredible access, that Bild has a global presence.”As editor, Reichelt sees himself less as a news impresario than as an emotional entrepreneur. “Journalism is basically about emotions, as all of the other news outlets in this country seem to have forgotten,” he told me. Reichelt likes to point out what he sees as the shared delusions of the more “respectable” German press. “Take Merkel,” he said. “Here you have this completely mediocre mind, and the press has created this elaborate mythology around her. That she’s some sort of savage wit in private – which is not true, by the way – and that she’s fantastically clever – which is not true either. She’s just capable of identifying the direction of prevailing winds.”For Reichelt, Merkel represents the depoliticisation of German society, a process that has obscured the faultlines between conservatives and liberals. For almost two decades, at a series of decisive moments, Merkel has deftly stolen her antagonists’ platforms out from under them. In 2003, she phased in a neoliberal agenda in the CDU, but when it nearly backfired at the polls two years later, she started to introduce programmes from the Social Democrats. In the wake of the Fukushima disaster, Merkel became anti-nuclear overnight. Merkel’s response to the 1 million migrants entering Germany in the summer of 2015 has been widely interpreted as an instance of principle over pragmatism – a chancellor seizing the chance to make amends for her nation’s past – but even then, Merkel had carefully weighed German public opinion, and promptly ramped up anti-refugee legislation once the middle class’s pro-refugee enthusiasm had subsided. The leftwing sociologist Wolfgang Streeck once described Merkel as “a postmodern politician with a premodern, Machiavellian contempt for both causes and people”.This shape-shifting has made German politics a much more difficult game to play, and Reichelt sees it as his job to restore the old pre-Merkel isions. To this end, he has made Bild into a loudspeaker for some of the chancellor’s fiercest critics. In early September 2018, in the wake of violent far-right demonstrations in the Saxon city of Chemnitz, Reichelt met with Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of German intelligence, and offered him the the pulpit of Bild when Maassen wanted to contradict Merkel’s account of anti-migrant “hunts” that had allegedly taken place in Chemnitz. Maassen’s attempt to cast doubt on the chancellor’s version of events got him removed from his post, but it transformed him into one of the most vocal martyrs of the German right.Since his earliest teenage years, Reichelt dreamed of becoming the editor of Bild Zeitung. I asked him how someone like himself, born in Hamburg in 1980 – when Bild was still considered radioactive by most teachers and students across Germany – could have concocted such an ambition. “I was born into a family of journalists,” Reichelt told me. “In our household, Axel Springer was a hero, and Heinrich Böll was an enemy.” Reichelt, who perfected his English abroad at Cushing Academy, a boarding school in Massachusetts, looked up to young Bild reporters as bourgeois paladins pitted against the leftwing rabble of 1980s Hamburg, a city teeming with wealth, but also one of the hubs of the country’s anarchist left.It is hard to think of an institution more tightly bound up with the history of the Federal Republic than Bild Zeitung. The first introduction that some young Germans get to the paper today is Günter Wallraff’s withering exposé, Der Aufmacher (The Leader-writer), which continues to be taught in a few secondary schools four decades after its publication. In 1977, Wallraff went undercover in order to try to expose Bild as a giant fabrication mill. Instead he discovered an underworld of cynical publicists intent on becoming cheerleaders of the postwar German economic boom. In one scene, which describes a regular day at the Bild office, one of the Bild reporters listens to a distressed caller who has called into a fake suicide-prevention hotline that Bild has set up, and whispers to Wallraff: “He’s about to jump off the balcony any minute, he’s nearly there!”I visited Wallraff last year in his light-filled studio in the Ehrenfeld neighbourhood of Cologne. His office is full of African art, and the books of his heroes, such as Upton Sinclair. “In the 1970s and 80s, Bild was in total control of the media, and there was very little being done about it,” Wallraff told me, over a game of ping-pong in his workshop. “If you were their enemy, they made you into a terrorist.”We retreated back into Wallraff’s studio, where he had the latest copy of Bild. The headline was about Boris Johnson’s hair: “This mop now rules Britain”. “I haven’t flipped through it in a while,” Wallraff told me. “But I can see it’s taken a more civilised tone. You should have seen it in the 1970s: all of the articles in support of the dictatorship in Greece and Chile, the articles in favour of apartheid.”Wallraff remains a heroic figure for many Germans who remember Bild as an enemy of the student protesters of 1968 – whom the newspaper referred to as “rioters”, “a radical danger”, and “left-academic fascists”. One of Springer’s main targets was the Marxist thinker and activist Rudi Dutschke, who was shot in 1968 in Berlin by a rightwing fanatic inspired by the murderer of Martin Luther King Jr. A few days before the attack, Bild had referred to Dutschke as “State Enemy #1”, and it had previously run headlines such as “Stop Dutschke now!” After the shooting, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Berlin, chanting, “Bild shot as well!”. Dutschke suffered brain damage from the attack, and died years later as a result of his injuries.“West Germany in the 1960s was a completely authoritarian state,” said Gretchen Dutschke-Klotz – Dutschke’s widow, and an author of several books about 1968 – when we met in Berlin earlier this year. “Bild was the symbol of that.” Dutschke-Klotz agrees with Wallraff that Bild is a milder publication today, and that the 1968ers triumphed over it. “Society was full of old Nazis then,” she said. “It was full of people who, outside of the Weimar Republic, had barely lived in a democracy. Bild has been beaten in the cultural sphere, especially if you consider the place of women in society now, or climate politics.”But in the 60s there were others who took a different view: that what they were witnessing was the irreversible Springerisation of society. Heinrich Böll devoted not one, but three books, including one of his literary masterpieces – The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum – to denouncing Bild, which he credited not only with poisoning public life, but also with wrecking the German language itself with “primitive bon-mot-ism”. Bild, wrote Böll in 1972, was “no longer crypto-fascistic, no longer fascisoid, but naked fascism: incitement, lies, garbage”.The most visible element of West Germany’s hard left, the Red Army Faction, and its leading voice, Ulrike Meinhof, took Böll’s criticism a considerable step further. In May 1972, after calling for the expropriation of Springer, and holding public hearings against the company, the Red Army Faction bombed the Axel Springer offices in Hamburg, injuring at least 17 people. Meinhof declared the attacks were in the name of Springer’s victims: communists, Palestinians, foreign workers. “Who else were they going to attack?” Dutschke-Klotz told me. “The mayor of Berlin? He had already apologised for attacking student protesters. Bild was the obvious target.”That was almost 50 years ago. After the cold war, Bild became a celebrity rag, which former adversaries could dismiss as a more innocuous symptom of a depoliticised culture than an ideological lodestar in its own right. Kai Diekmann, who edited the paper from 2001 to 2015, neatly exhibited the contradictions of German conservatism in the Merkel era. A faithful page of Helmut Kohl, he wanted to maintain Germany’s position as the prime European reaper of globalisation – the country’s export model depends on taking advantage of a currency weakened by its fellow Eurozone members – but also attacked expressions of globalisation within Germany’s borders.In his 2007 screed, The Great Self-Deception, Diekmann railed against the usual suspects of the German right: Muslims, “multi-kulti” liberals and environmentalists. Diekmann’s idea was that the leftwards shuffle of the political consensus – exemplified in Merkel’s long-standing coalition with the Social Democrats – needed to be beaten back by an elite-led populist movement that would restore German conservatives to their former glory. The dream was to bring back good old-fashioned German values, but keep the settings of German economic dominance in place. As the political face of this movement, Diekmann favoured Merkel’s defence minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, whose impeccably aristocratic credentials and Ted-talk persona would make him the ideal patrician-tribune of Germany’s silent majority. But the dream collapsed in 2011, when Guttenberg fell into disgrace after it was discovered he had plagiarised his doctoral dissertation. Today, the man who was once due to make German conservatism great again runs an investment firm in Manhattan, and lives in Greenwich, Connecticut.Reichelt took over Bild in 2018, after his immediate predecessor, Tanit Koch, who tried to steer the paper in a more anodyne, Merkel-friendly direction, left the position. (Koch has spoken of her exit in cool terms, telling a German news website that she felt she did not have the support of the Axel Springer CEO.) Under Reichelt’s tenure, the paper quickly established itself as a battering ram against Merkel. Bild once again plays the game of guiding and reflecting public opinion on a host of questions. Among its enthusiasms are German cars and the arms industry. “At last! The Leopard-2 tank in Idlib and possibly soon in the fight against Assad’s Russian tanks (T-55, T-62, T-72 and T-90),” tweeted Bild’s political editor about recent events in Syria. “As always, it takes a Turk to use a German tank for what it was built for.”There are a few non-populist positions Reichelt takes that have the appearance of principle. “He has staked out anti-Putin, pro-Nato, pro-Israel positions well beyond the standard German line,” says Niggemeier. But the majority of the paper’s content is an ever-shifting attempt to harness popular discontent rather than indoctrinate readers in any specific programme. Reichelt himself has, for instance, repeatedly come to Merkel’s defence on her decision not to close the border to Syrian refugees in 2015, describing it as an ethical “no-brainer”, but the paper goes to great lengths to associate migrants with crime, and to demand deportations. On the environment, one day Bild might be lamenting Merkel’s call to shutter coal factories by 2038 (“The coal deadline is going to cost us!” ran a headline about the prospective job losses.) But another day you might read that “Our government officials are destroying the environment!” atop an article detailing the 200,000 yearly flights German officials take between ministries in Berlin and Bonn. Like Merkel herself, Reichelt is an arch-opportunist, congenitally averse to letting crises go to waste.Several German journalists I spoke to attributed Reichelt’s heightened focus on Bild’s politics to a desperate attempt to counteract falling readership numbers. One of Reichelt’s heroes, he told me, is Franz-Josef Strauss, a legendary conservative postwar politician, who was famous for his political mantra: “Never allow a party right of the Christian Social Union”. Bild’s competitors on its right today come from Breitbart-esque news blogs such as Politically Incorrect. Bild seems to have done its best to outflank these outlets by covering the same kinds of stories as them, often in much the same tone. In more than one case, these articles have been false. In 2017, the paper ran a story about a mob of Arab men assaulting women in a Frankfurt restaurant, which police subsequently confirmed never happened. On the international front, Bild echoes the calls of prominent German centrist liberals who believe Germany must assume a leading role in world affairs. “You have this ongoing performance whereby they call for Germany to be in the middle of the action, but have no sense of responsibility for what that would entail,” says Blätter editor Albrecht von Lucke. “As soon as you have German troops deployed anywhere, even on the most humanitarian mission imaginable, who will be the first to cry out about it when the first guys fall in the war? Who will demand they come home and that it’s all been a mistake? Bild. You can count on that.” It is the same mentality that led one Bavarian AfD politician earlier this year to tweet against the banning of a beer festival because of Covid-19 – only to go on to sue the city of Rosenheim for the rise in cases after the beer festival did take place.The coronavirus pandemic initially caught Bild – and the German right – off guard. After the government’s strong response to the crisis, Merkel seemed immune to criticism. Bild turned its focus to China. In April, Reichelt published a public letter demanding €149bn in reparations from Beijing for the economic impact of Covid-19. “You shut down every newspaper and website that is critical of your rule,” Reichelt wrote in the letter, “but not the stalls where bat soup is sold.” The stunt made headlines around the world, and predictably enraged the Chinese embassy in Berlin. (A more expansive version of Bild’s letter by Springer’s CEO, calling for the decoupling of western economies from China, appeared in Springer’s respectable daily, Die Welt.) It’s this willingness to play fast and loose with geopolitics, now in a populist vein, that makes Bild, according to von Lucke, “much more dangerous than it ever was before”. (Not that Bild neglected the domestic front. “Despite corona restrictions, 300 people gather at mosque for prayer”, read one headline in April. “Churches closed for fear of Ramadan-chaos,” ran another.)When public impatience with closed schools and shops began to mount in late May, Bild, having failed to gain traction with its usual scapegoats, changed tack. Its new target was Germany’s leading virologist, Christian Drosten, who had become an unexpected celebrity thanks to his measured media interviews and his advisory role to Merkel’s government. On 25 May, one of Bild’s reporters sent him an email, claiming that other experts had serious criticisms of his latest study on Covid-19. The reporter demanded that Drosten respond within an hour. Instead, Drosten published the email on Twitter and said there that he had “better things to do”. The subsequent article, which tried to blow up minor statistical disagreements into a public assault on Drosten’s reputation, backfired drastically. The German mediasphere rallied to his defense: #Ichhabebessereszutun (#betterthingstodo) became a hashtag. Georg Streiter, a former deputy government spokesperson who also used to work at Bild and still praises the paper, called it a baseless smear campaign, and put the blame squarely on Reichelt. “It’s like dog owners,” he said. “The problem is usually at the top of the leash.”“We’re read by more German professors than any other publication,” Reichelt told me when I visited his office in the Axel Springer building in Berlin last year. “We’re read by the businessmen and the workers – and if some read us for ironic reasons, well, that’s fine, too.”The Springer building is a giant glass structure that towers over nearby restaurants and embassies. (A new Springer building, designed by Rem Koolhaas, which resembles a damaged glass cube, has been recently erected across the road.) Outside is a statue of a vaguely leprous-looking Axel Springer. A few streets over, extending more than five storeys up the side of the headquarters of Taz, the leftwing daily, stands another piece of Bild lore: a giant high-relief sculpture of Kai Diekmann’s penis. This ostentatious invasion of the former Bild editor’s privacy, unveiled in 2009, sprouted out of a long conflict that had begun seven years earlier, when Diekmann sued Taz for publishing a satirical article claiming he had undergone penis enhancement surgery in Miami. (At the time the judge ruled that, as the nation’s leading purveyor and profiteer of gossip, Diekmann must learn to live with this jab at this dignity.)With its smartly dressed assistants and ample supply of alcohol, Bild’s headquarters in Berlin succeeds in transmitting a throwback aura. “In case there’s any doubt that I’m a real tabloid editor,” Reichelt said, flashing me his lighter with a naked woman on it, as he lit up a Gauloises Blue in his office. The room was strewn with Americana: a Kennedy photograph, a Reagan biography. On top of a pile of books lay a child’s car seat, next to a contemporary military-grade helmet that Reichelt wore when he covered the Syrian war for Springer. On the floor was a copy of the Financial Times. (“It repays the attention you give it every morning,” he told me. “It’s such a great product.”) I asked him why, in the past couple of years, Bild has reduced the number of naked women in the paper. “It wasn’t for any politically correct reason,” said Reichelt. “It’s just that when so much of your staff is female, and they’re all very professional, it just gets slightly awkward having to rank naked women with them day in and day out.”For the daily editorial meeting, we entered a conference room, where about 12 staffers were seated around a long table, overlooking the Berlin skyline. “What have we got?” Reichelt asked. An image of Ursula von der Leyen was displayed on a big screen. “Can we give her a bit more brightness in her face?” asked one of the women at the table. “She looks a bit lugubrious.” “There we go, there we go – more gravitas now,” said another woman.“What’s going on in that?” Reichelt said, looking at a photo of a musician wearing lederhosen and a high-and-tight haircut. Reichelt was munching on chocolate now. I had been told that Bild editorial meetings could be rough going, but this one was running smoothly.“That’s the folk singer Andreas Gabalier,” said another man at the table. “He going to be awarded the Karl Valentin prize in Munich, but apparently he’s some kind of rightwing hardliner.”“What’s he doing in the photo?” Reichelt asked.“Apparently he’s contorted his body into the form of a swastika,” the man replied.“I don’t quite see it,” Reichelt said.“Couldn’t it just be a walk-like-an-Egyptian dance move there?”“Yes, it’s all a bit unclear.”“All right, we’ll just say that some people interpret it as a swastika.”“Anything on the crime front?” Reichelt asked.“We’ve got a paedophile paediatrician who sexually abused young boys for 15 years.”“What was the ruling on this guy?” Reichelt asked.“Judge has put him away for ever.”“Nice. Great judge. Can I see a photo of him?” A photo of a grey-haired man named Roland Christiani flashed up on the screen. “What a great face! He looks like a professor,” Reichelt said. “Let’s give him a bump in the headline.”“How about ‘Judge locks paediatrician away for ever’?”“I like it!” said Reichelt.“Can I get a show of hands of how many of you are for the proposed speed limit?” Reichelt asked his lieutenants. Merkel’s government was threatening to impose a speed limit on German cars. A few hands went up. “God, it’s just like the country at large – we’re completely ided on this,” Reichelt said. “Why are you against it?” He trained his eyes on an editor.“People just drive too fast. I’m tired of being scared on the autobahn when a car comes by doing 200kmh.”“The trouble is that if you lower the speed limit I can’t make it to Hamburg in two hours any more,” another editor said.“You drive to Hamburg in two hours? That’s insane: maybe there should be a limit,” Reichelt joked.The trouble with the speed limit, Reichelt later told me in private, was that it interfered with the fundamental German ideal of freedom, which is that, within the rules, you can do what you want. “There are too many Germans now waking up to find that if they eat meat and love their car, they’re suddenly Nazis,” Reichelt said. “And that’s exactly how the German left speaks. They speak of their fellow citizens as criminals, as people committing crimes against future generations, and they even want to see if they can perhaps introduce punishments – to formally make this into a crime. But what about all those people who aren’t waiting for the delivery of their new Tesla?” Next year will almost certainly be Merkel’s last as chancellor. She has already relinquished her position as the secretary of the CDU. When it came to the struggle to determine her successor last year – specifically, who would fill the role of secretary – Reichelt personally favoured the millionaire businessman Friedrich Merz over Merkel’s chosen successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. But Reichelt hastened to point out that his favourites don’t get special treatment in Bild. “Did I want Merz to replace Merkel? Probably. Did we hesitate to destroy him? No. Bild ran the interview that fatally damaged his campaign when he claimed he was a millionaire but still middle-class. The power to destroy is Bild’s most valuable weapon, and I would not sacrifice it for anything – not even my own political preferences.” It was a nice line, but Reichelt’s resort to journalistic principle seemed a convenient way to gloss an interview that had, quite unexpectedly, taken on a life of its own.With Merkel’s departure on the horizon, the fight is already brewing at the political centre, as German regional leaders try to outbid each other with the comprehensiveness of their coronavirus crackdowns in a headlong appeal to the aged voters who still determine German politics. In the face of this political future, Reichelt is sanguine. “Trump has shown that anything can happen – that’s just a fact,” he told me. “There is no reason that the future has to be dictated by Green parties and child protesters.”But there seems little chance that Bild will be able to retrieve any viable vintage of German conservative leadership from the cellar. “We have to hope that the radicalisation of Bild, like the rise of autocrats around the world, represents the last gasp of patriarchal thinking,” says Tania Martini, a media critic for Taz. As Bild’s sputtering failure to derail Merkel and her scientists during the pandemic showed, the German public is largely unwilling at present to erge from what it takes to be the steady course. Threats to Bild’s position as Merkel’s leading critic are closer to home: the most scathing recent critique of Merkel’s government has come from outside any established political platform, in the form of a blue-haired, 27-year-old internet influencer who castigated the German political establishment for its record on climate change, welfare, and migration in a 55-minute, copiously annotated YouTube video, which has been viewed more than 17m times.The last time I saw Reichelt in his office, last summer, he wanted to talk about his preferred enemies. “There is Putin,” he told me. “He wants to weaken our German institutions and interfere with our elections. You know why? Because he knows he lives in a piece of shit country – that he has made his country into shit – and so he wants other countries to come down to his level so that his disastrous record can be less easily seen.”Before he could get any further in his diatribe, a Bild reporter lunged into the office. “Piëch is dead,” he announced. The family owner of Porsche, Ferdinand Piëch, had apparently died.“In a pizzeria,” said the reporter. “It seems it was a heart attack.”“Can we get confirmation?” He suggested giving Gerhard Schröder a call.“Sure, we’ll get confirmation.”Piëch had not died in a pizzeria after all, we learned a few moments later, somewhat to Reichelt’s annoyance. But then he quickly picked back up the thread. “Then we have the spineless left at home, that just wants to let Putin and Assad run roughshod over the whole liberal western order. They want to bring the German car industry to a screeching halt, freeze rents in Berlin, starve the economy and keep Germany from doing anything in the world. I remember meeting with some people here in the defence ministry when I got back from covering the war in Syria. Let’s build a no-fly zone in northern Syria, I said. Let’s go do it alone if we have to. But no one in Germany with power knows how to use it – or even wants to use it.”“What about Bild?” I asked.“With Bild,” Reichelt smiled, “it’s the other way around.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25c79106f1b268eba9afffd3035c1dfbf29eca92/0_69_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8ea96a24a6ba9e6e2294c85aee9f4d7","title":"black lives matter sculpture of jen reid removed colston  bristol","story":"The sculpture of protester has been taken to a museum for artist Marc Quinn to collect, says Bristol city councilThe sculpture of a Black Lives Matter protester that replaced a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol has been removed just 24 hours after it went up.Contractors were pictured using ropes and a crane to secure the statue of Jen Reid, who had been photographed standing on the plinth with a raised fist on the day the figure of Colston was removed, at about 5.20am on Thursday morning.A witness said that the workmen carefully secured the strap before moving the Marc Quinn sculpture, with one saying “don’t break her dress”. It was then lifted into a recycling and skip hire lorry and driven away.A Bristol city council spokeswoman said: “This morning we removed the sculpture. It will be held at our museum for the artist to collect or donate to our collection.”BBC Bristol reported that Quinn would be charged with the cost of the removal and that the council said it had received complaints of fly-tipping.Reid and Quinn have said that any proceeds from the sale of the work will go to two charities chosen by Reid that are devoted to improving the teaching of black history in British schools.The black resin and steel statue, entitled A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020, was put up without the council’s knowledge shortly before 5am on Wednesday by a team under the direction of Quinn. He had said it was not intended to be in place permanently.Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, told BBC Radio 5 Live that the city was going through an “incredibly delicate time”.“This is not about taking down a statue of Jen, who is a very impressive woman,” Rees said.“This is about taking down a statue of a London-based artist who came and put it up without permission.”Rees said when he spoke to Quinn, the artist was unaware that after the toppling of the Colston statue the grave of Scipio Africanus - a memorial to an enslaved African man – had been vandalised. A message left in chalk near the site read: “Put Colston’s statue back or things will really heat up.”“If you’re going to do something, you need to do it with awareness and a full knowledge of the context in which you’re doing it,” Rees said.The statue of Colston had stood for more than a century, prompting some social media users to say that the council should have allowed the statue of Reid to remain in place for longer before bringing it down.Tim Burns, a charity worker, said: “Some days I wake up a feel proud to live in Bristol. Other days I feel like we missed the point? The Jen Reid statue didn’t need to be permanent but after procrastinating for years over whether to take down Colston removing this after 24 hours feels unnecessary.”The author Bernardine Evaristo tweeted: “Now it has to find a public spot. If Bristol doesn’t have the guts, I nominate Brixton.”Police said on Thursday that no offence had been committed and the statue’s future was a matter for the council. Most passersby in Bristol appeared to approve of the addition to the plinth, with many taking selfies raising a fist in front of it.There was some tension last night when a group arrived to say the statue should come down, prompting others on the scene to take a knee.Before the statue came down, Reid and Quinn both said that they viewed its future as being a matter for others to decide. “Whether it’s there for a day or a week or a month, it’s been there,” Reid said.Quinn said that “once you make an artwork, you have no control over it any more”.• This article was amended on 16 July 2020 to correct a statement about damage to the grave of Scipio Africanus and to correct a misspelling of Bernardine Evaristo’s first name."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f18fde270d2974279aa347d8d27f3cc0e62ded6d/73_138_872_523/master/872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b666b2b45dc051c9ed3ad4e85ff5b09","title":"dutch city ends ties with polish twin declared gay free zone nieuwegein pulawy","story":"Nieuwegein council votes to end links to Puławy, which has vowed to discourage tolerance A Dutch city has severed its longstanding ties with its twin in Poland after the Polish municipality established itself as an official “gay-free zone”.The city council of Nieuwegein, south of Utrecht, voted almost unanimously to end its friendship with Puławy in eastern Poland.The municipality 80 miles from Warsaw is one of 100 that have vowed to discourage tolerance and avoid providing financial assistance to NGOs working to promote equal rights.“LGBT-free zones”, backed by resolutions voted on by local councillors, are said by equality campaigners to cover about a third of Poland.Following the decision by councillors in Nieuwegein to vote by 26-1 to terminate the relationship, stickers with a rainbow flag were placed on one of the city’s entrance signs to cover up its Polish counterpart’s name.“Setting the gay-free zones is a serious business and our council has issued a very clear statement that this is not acceptable,” said the Dutch city’s alderman, Marieke Schouten. “We are a rainbow city. And we are both part of Europe, in which we believe that whoever you are, regardless of your orientation, you can be there in public space. It does not include a gay-free zone.”The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, who secured a new term last weekend, vowed during his election campaign to “defend children from LGBT ideology”. The pledge proved popular among his conservative base and the Catholic church.In a survey conducted last year, when asked to name the biggest threat to Poland the most popular answer among men under 40 was “the LGBT movement and gender ideology”.Duda, who is allied with the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) , also vowed to oppose gay marriage or adoption by gay couples, which he described as part of “a foreign ideology”.The mayor of Nieuwegein, Frans Backhuijs, had expressed his concerns about developments in a letter to Puławy in March but did not receive a response.Bożena Krygier, the president of Puławy city council, told the Dutch broadcaster RTL Nederland: “Poland is Poland with its own identity, its own history and its own ideas. This is why we believe that partner municipalities should not interfere with our resolutions.”Relations between the two cities had already been in the deep freeze since 2015 after more than 21 years of official twinning.The motion backed by the councillors this week formally proposed to “unfriend” the two municipalities and terminate all contacts.“We therefore hope that the people concerned, who belong to the LGBTI community in Poland, feel supported by us,” Schouten said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e814766b60ff64f8ee51b9af28f9f297fbaf671/143_465_3113_1868/master/3113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a646e2c4cb5c3d3454a84a0889c6bbf6","title":"uk government orders halt randox covid 19 tests over safety issues","story":"Care homes and members of public told to immediately stop using kits produced by firmCare homes and members of the public have been instructed by the government to immediately stop using coronavirus testing kits produced by a healthcare firm after safety problems were discovered.Randox was awarded a £133m contract in March to produce the testing kits for England, Wales and Northern Ireland without any other firms being given the opportunity to bid for the work.Under the contract, the kits are sent to the public and places such as care homes and then delivered back to Randox to check swabs to see if iniduals have the virus.In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said it had been “notified that some test kits produced by Randox laboratories may not meet our required safety standards for coronavirus testing”.The DHSC did not explain the nature of the problem. It added: “As a precautionary measure and while we investigate further, NHS test and trace are requesting that all settings pause the use of Randox test kits with immediate effect and until further notice. The risk to safety is low and test results from Randox kits are not affected.”The department said its instruction only “applies to unused Randox test kits, which are clearly marked with that name. Used Randox test kits can still be collected for processing as normal.”In a statement, Randox said: “As an immediate precautionary measure we have temporarily suspended distribution of home sample collection kits using one particular batchsupplier of swabs.

But now another legal challenge has been declared in an attempt to prevent the commission from declaring Granger’s defeat.On Tuesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said it was time for Granger to step aside, announcing travel bans “against those undermining democracy in the country, or complicit in doing so”. He said the country was on “a non-democratic trajectory”.Pompeo’s move has been endorsed by the US Senate foreign relations committee. Canada also said it would use all the tools at its disposal to demand a swift and transparent conclusion to the election process.Two UK Foreign Office ministers, Tariq Ahmad and Liz Sugg, have made successive calls for Granger to accept the result.The Foreign Office has been taking a gradual approach, hoping for reconciliation between Granger’s political coalition, the APNU+AFC, and the rival PPPC, believing the president would eventually stand down if he ran out of viable options in his attempt to hold on to power.Aspects of Guyanese politics are ided on ethnic lines, making the transition more fraught.In December, ExxonMobil began producing crude off the country’s shore. Oil is expected to transform the economy of the poor country, which has a population of 800,000, and there are fears the discovery could prompt Granger to use the military to stay in power.The country’s two main ethnic groups have grown suspicious that the other is seeking control of oil revenues.Ralph Gonsalves, the prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines and chair of the regional Caricom political grouping, said: “A rogue clique within Guyana cannot be allowed to disrespect or disregard, with impunity, the clear, unambiguous ruling of the CCJ. The time for decisive action is shortly upon us”.The Organisation of American States has also issued a statement accusing Lowenfield of acting in bad faith.“The only democratic solution for Guyana at this time is respect for the results of the national recount,” the OAS said. “No other figures – neither those prepared prior to the recount, nor those recently invalidated by the Caribbean court of justice, nor any others that may be unilaterally devised by the chief elections officer – can have any place in the final determination of results. A new electoral process is also an unacceptable solution.”In a sign of the tensions a fire suspected as arson gutted the Guyana election headquarters on Tuesday night.Jan Mangal, a former adviser to the president, said it was vital the international community did not just issue a slap on the wrist or else ballot rigging would become entrenched.He said he was concerned the Granger government was pressing ahead and signing rushed and unscrutinised infrastructure contracts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31e56080b9df59a04cb288b28a387f67ee15dd14/0_0_4560_3040/master/4560.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6525699a9f03a66fc3c69adae907d926 660w","title":"coronavirus live news fauci says us must stop nonsense south africa cases top 300000","story":"Israel reports new daily record of cases 125 million in India under new lockdown Beijing Winter Olympics under threatThe news that there may be a delay in re-opening pubs in Ireland has been described as a “hammer blow” by the Licensed Vintners Association, which represents pub owners, who said the future of 7,000 pubs and 50,000 jobs hung in the balance.Ireland has paused its phased easing of lockdown and extended rules on face coverings amid a surge in Covid-19 cases. Leo Varadkar, the tánaiste (deputy prime minister), told parliament today that pubs, nightclubs and other venues will open no sooner than 10 August, and possibly later.They were due to reopen on 20 July as part of the fourth phase of the lifting of lockdown but on Wednesday the government announced a pause, citing a sharp rise in the R number to between 1.2 and 1.8. Northern Ireland has recorded a slight rise to between 0.5 and 1.But Danny Healy-Rae, an independent TD (MP) with a constituency in county Kerry, challenged the logic of differentiating between pubs that served food. “Tis fairly foolish to think that the virus can know whether you’re eating with your pint or not.”His brother Danny, also an independent TD for Kerry, said publicans were being treated unfairly and were extremely angry at the “crazy decision” to delay reopening.The study was based on the death certificates of 4,942 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 and carried out until 25 May, by which time 31,573 people were officially reported to have died of the disease.Almost 35,000 people have died of coronavirus in Italy. Health minister, Roberto Speranza, banned air, road and rail travel from Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo on Thursday as the country tries to limit new outbreaks mostly triggered by imported infections.The move follows last week’s ban on travel from 13 countries considered high-risk, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Kuwait and Bahrain. Italy reported 162 new infections on Wednesday, up by 48 from the previous day.The air will be freshly piped, the rooms deep cleaned and handshakes banned. As European Union leaders gather for their first physical meeting in Brussels on Friday to thrash out a coronavirus recovery plan, no effort has been spared to avoid a local outbreak of the disease.The two-day meeting, thought to be the largest gathering of world leaders since the start of the pandemic, will be the first featuring all 27 heads of state and government since February, when an attempt to agree the EU’s €1tn seven-year budget collapsed in acrimony.On Friday and Saturday they will return to the same task, as well as seeking to hammer out a €750bn (£689bn) recovery plan to help cope with the biggest economic shock forecast in EU history.But any pre-summit bonhomie smoothing the way to a deal will be limited by social distancing. Leaders are being asked to wear masks on arrival and avoid shaking hands – advice that appears to preclude the air kissing and backslapping that usually accompany the opening of summit talks.Gathering in the Europa headquarters of the European council, nicknamed the “Space Egg”, leaders will meet in a fifth floor room designed to seat 330 people. This will ensure social distancing for 30 leaders (27 national ones plus three from the EU institutions), plus three or four top EU officials.Health authorities have ordered the culling of all 93,000 mink at a farm in eastern Spain to prevent human contagion after discovering most of the animals there had been infected with the coronavirus.The farm in the village of La Puebla de Valverde in the region of Aragon, 200km (125 miles) east of Madrid, came to the attention of the authorities after the wife of one of its workers tested positive in May.Joaquín Olona, the head of the Aragon agriculture department, said on Thursday that seven farm workers had subsequently tested positive, including the woman’s husband.Benjamin Netanyahu has been accused of attempting to deflect public anger over his handling of Israel’s pandemic and an ongoing corruption trial, by proposing a cash handout to all Israelis regardless of their income.The Israeli prime minister presented the 6bn shekel (£1.4bn) package on Wednesday night, with payments of up to £175 for iniduals. This payments will rise to nearly £700 for families, arguing it would boost spending and “get the economy moving faster”.The plan, which needs cabinet approval, was swiftly rejected on Thursday by senior officials, including government ministers, who said the money should instead be targeted at the poorest citizens.The Bank of Israel governor, Amir Yaron, told a local radio station there were “more effective ways” to encourage consumer spending. The foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, from the former opposition Blue and White party, said the money should instead go “to those who are hurting and not to those who don’t need it”.

More than 125 million people in India were put under a new lockdown after the country registered more than 600 deaths in a single day.The lockdown was imposed on impoverished Bihar state, neighbouring Nepal. “We have not faced such a situation in my life before. It is really a horrible experience,” housewife Radhika Singh, told AFP in Bihar, where all schools, clubs, temples and non-essential businesses were ordered closed.Russian state-sponsored hackers are targeting UK, US and Canadian organisations involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine development, according to British security officials.The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre said drug companies and research groups were being targeted by a group known as APT29, which it said was “almost certainly” part of the Kremlin’s intelligence services.British officials would not say if any of the attacks had been successful in their goal of stealing medical secrets. They stressed, however, that none of the vaccine research had been compromised as a result.It is rare for the UK to explicitly state it believes another country is behind a coordinated campaign of cyber-attacks but British officials indicated it shared its assessment with the United States and Canada, both of whom are expected to release their own updates shortly.Read the full storyWith their low infection rate, the Canary Islands are being used as a laboratory for safe tourism.

Today marks the anniversary of Bernadette’s visions and the discovery of allegedly healing spring waters. It led the church to build a cathedral at the site near the Pyrenees in southern France. The shrine was closed on 17 March for the first time in its history due to the pandemic. Today’s celebrations include masses, processions and prayers, in addition to priests and guests speaking about how Lourdes has affected their lives. It’s being called Lourdes United, and is being broadcast all day until 10pm.Lourdes attracts around 3 million pilgrims a year, the second most popular place in France after Paris, and the region’s tourism has badly suffered during the coronavirus crisis.Hi. This is Caroline Davies taking over the blog for a short while. The German abattoir hit by a coronavirus outbreak that led to a second lockdown for the surrounding region reopened its slaughterhouse on Thursday, though the impact of new hygiene measures on the plant’s capacity is unclear.Authorities on Wednesday said the Toennies slaughterhouse in Rheda-Wiedenbrueck could resume operations after it bolstered health and safety procedures. The meat processing and packing plant remains closed but is due to be inspected on Thursday.The site, which is particularly important for the German pig farming sector, closed in mid-June after about 1,500 workers tested positive for Covid-19.The first phase of human trials of a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by researchers at the University of Oxford suggests it triggers two types of immune response, unnamed sources working on the vaccine have reportedly said.The jab triggers the production of antibodies – proteins that can bind to the virus, preventing it from entering cells and flagging it to immune cells – and causes the production of “killer” T cells – immune cells that attack infected human cells.’s Nicola Davis has been examining what we have learned from phase one of the trial.A partnership to help Unicef secure vital Covid-19 medical products for low- and middle-income countries has been announced by MedAccess, a UK-based social finance company.The guarantee of up to $50m is aimed at enabling the United Nations body to engage in high-volume purchasing orders with manufacturers, and respond to demand for medical supplies and diagnostic tests at affordable prices.In Ireland, the deputy prime minister has been defending the government’s decision to delay the opening of pubs that do not serve food.Leo Varadkar, who holds the role of Tanaiste, told member’s of Ireland’s parliament that pubs could open with strict social distancing but that prospect becomes increasingly difficult when alcohol is solely involved.“Even when it is in restaurants, when people are consuming alcohol it’s very hard to maintain social distancing,” he said.Varadkar added that, at present, there was no guarantee that pubs would be able to open on August 10 and that the government would be watching very closely to see if infection rates increased.Covid-19 continues to impact on the world of sport. The cricketer Jofra Archer has been dropped from England’s second Test against the West Indies and severely reprimanded after breaching biosecure protocols by stopping off at his flat during the journey.England’s players travelled on Monday in separate cars following their four-wicket defeat at Hampshire’s Ageas Bowl and were told there must be no breaks in the 230-mile journey bar the use of a designated biosecure county ground for lunch, and pre-approved petrol stations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6139900078d54d5c65c817b25f0a486afae18fc/356_0_2294_1378/master/2294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b5c5d4cfe594def22c47a90bccd54f4","title":"coronavirus uk 649000 people lose jobs during lockdown live updates","story":"Chief scientific adviser gives evidence to science and technology committee Scotland records first Covid-related death in eight daysVallance told the committee that SAGE advised the government to impose lockdown measures “as soon as possible” on the 16 or 18 March. He said this happened as soon as data showed further restrictions were needed. “Looking back, you can see the data may have preceded that but the data was not available before that.” Scientists realised in mid-March that “we were further ahead in the epidemic than had been thought”.Back to the Science and Technology committee, where chief scientific adviser has said the coronavirus lockdown “carries risks” to the public’s mental and physical health. He told the committee it was “crucially important” that the indirect impact of the measures on people’s health were fully understood. “I think the chief medical officer has been pretty clear about this, and that is the way this should be looked at... overall excess deaths,” said Vallance. “If you look at overall excess deaths then you’re looking at the integrated effect of the virus itself with all the other reasons people may have suffered as a result of this.“We do need to understand the impact of that and it’s very clear that lockdown itself carries risks, and those risks are to both physical health and mental health.”Half a million fewer affordable houses will be built over the next five years unless there is a step change in supply, a commission has found. In a report published today, the Affordable Housing Commission calls for a sustained ‘counter-cyclical’ social housing programme, with funding targeted at social rented properties for low income households – many of whom, the report found, are essential workers stuck in the more costly private rented sector.The report, ‘Making housing affordable after Covid-19’ found that with government backing, a boosted social housing sector can also help improve housing conditions, reduce carbon emissions and combat poverty.The Commission proposes a 12-point social housing-led recovery plan, which includes measures to: return housing grants to the previous levels which helped rescue the housing market after the global financial crisis, a new ‘Housing Conversion Fund’ for social landlords to buy unsold homes and other properties, reforms to the Right to Buy and Permitted Development Rights, caps on rent rises, strengthening the safety net for renters, and extending Help to Buy to existing properties for those on the margins of home ownership.Lord Richard Best, chair of the Affordable Housing Commission, said. “As people face reduced incomes and potential unemployment, the need for truly affordable social rented homes becomes even greater.”Darren Baxter, policy \u0026amp partnerships manager at the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation said: “High housing costs were a key driver of poverty in the UK before the pandemic and now with unemployment rising, many people risk being pulled into hardship and even homelessness if they can no longer afford to meet their housing costs. “To prevent this, the government must strengthen the safety net for renters, so that our social security system can provide a lifeline for the thousands at risk of unemployment when the furlough scheme draws to a close. And as the task of rebuilding our economy begins, investment at scale in social and affordable housing must be a priority.”For the full report see: www.affordablehousingcommission.orgA further 19 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed hospital deaths to 29,144.NHS England said the patients were aged between 52 and 91 and all had underlying conditions. Another 10 deaths were reported with no positive coronavirus test result.Vallance has been asked if the government was right to wait until a study that showed care home staff were at increased risk of catching the virus, and could pass it on to residents while showing no symptoms, was published earlier this month before they rolled out regular testing for care home staff and residents.Vallance emphasised that Sage members are not policy-makers, but provide advice to the government. He added that Sage was giving the government advice on protecting care homes from coronavirus outbreaks “in February”, but cannot remember if it advised the government that staff and residents should be routinely tested.Asked his views on the UK’s response to the coronavirus pandemic not being “the most admired in the world”, Vallance said: “It’s clear that the outcome has not been good in the UK, I think you can be absolutely clear about that.”He stressed that adequate “data systems” needed to be in place so that authorities had the necessary information to deal with emergencies such as the pandemic. “It would have been absolutely preferable to have had much greater testing capacity earlier on, but it’s not just testing, it’s basic information flows around patients in hospital, rates of admission, rates of movement,” he said.Sir Patrick Vallance has just been asked if there were any instances in which the government had gone against scientific advice on Covid-19.“In general, what I can be absolutely clear about is that those making policy decisions have heard and understood the scientific advice,” Vallance said.“Clearly as the pandemic progresses and indeed as we get into release measures from lockdown there are many other considerations that need to be taken into account as well as the science.”“What we’re doing is laying out the scientific reasons behind options from which people can choose and overlaying that with economic and other considerations is the job of government.”The science and technology committee is taking evidence in the House of Commons as part of its UK science, research and technology capability and influence in global disease outbreaks inquiry. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, will both appear as witnesses on the latest developments in the scientific evidence on Covid-19, as well as the government’s response to the crisis.

Contact tracing will not sufficiently reduce transmission of Covid-19 if a person is not tested within three days of developing symptoms, a new study claims.Researchers said the R value, which is the number of people a single infected person will go on to infect, can be reduced from 1.2 to 0.8 through contact tracing in the “most optimistic scenario”.Prof Mirjam Kretzschmar, one of the lead authors of the study, from the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, said: “This study reinforces findings from other modelling studies, showing that contact tracing can be an effective intervention to prevent spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but only if the proportion of contacts traced is high and the process is fast.”The Welsh chief medical officer, Frank Atherton, has said a spike in deaths in Ceredigion in mid Wales at the start of 2020 will be investigated but he believes it unlikely it is due to Covid-19.Speaking at the Welsh government’s daily press conference, Atherton said: “There are fluctuations and statistical changes that happen, and it may be a part of that,” he said.“I’ve heard questions about: ‘Could there have been coronavirus earlier than Christmas?’, for example. I think that’s extremely unlikely, that coronavirus was in Ceredigion before it was in Wuhan.”He said it was “unlikely to be a coronavirus effect” but that the director of public health in the county “will be looking at that with her colleagues in the health board and across the local authority”Atherton said he would not describe himself as a sceptic on the benefits of face coverings. But he said that if too much focus was put on masks it was possible to lose sight of “bigger things” such as social distancing and good hygiene.Three-layer face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July – but the country is not ordering people to wear them in shops."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"National Economic and Social Council sets out actions needed for sustainable recoveryAnalysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"A beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creatures"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Government has delayed the next reopening phase from the Covid-19 lockdown, postponing the reopening of remaining pubs and resumption of larger gatherings of people amid concerns over rising coronavirus infections.Plans to allow pubs that do not serve food and nightclubs to recommence business from July 20th has been postponed until August 10th after the State’s health officials raised concerns about an increase in Covid-19 infections as restrictions have been relaxed. Proposals to permit larger gatherings of 100 people indoors, up from 50, and 500 people outdoors, up from 200, will also not proceed as earlier planned.And, in a further precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the disease, the Government has extended the mandatory wearing of face coverings to shops, shopping centres and retail workers where there is no protective screen or a two-metre distance between them and their customers.The rise in the number of infections from “unrestricted house parties” has led the Government to recommend social visits to other people’s homes be limited to 10 visitors from no more than four households.The advice against unnecessary travel overseas has been extended but the Government still plans to publish a “green list” of countries with similar levels of infection rates that people can travel to, though it is maintaining advice against non-essential foreign travel. Reproduction numberTaoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government was not proceeding with the fourth reopening phase as the reproduction number of the virus, a key metric tracked to assess the rate of infection, had risen above one, meaning it was spreading in the community.Mr Martin said the virus had not changed and “remains as indiscriminate in its cruelty as it has since it arrived, and it remains as relentless as ever in its effort to find new hosts”.Getting the “R number” back below one would give the Government the best possible chance to reopen schools in late August and to resume essential healthcare, he said. The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) was “worried about the trajectory” of the virus, Mr Martin said, and if it continued to spread at the current rate, it could jeopardise plans to reopen schools. The Taoiseach also said there needed to be “better follow-up” to ensure visitors arriving into the country were complying with the 14-day self-isolating period. He promised an increased presence of compliance staff and communications at ports and airports and more extensive tracing.The State’s acting chief medical officer, Dr Ronan Glynn, said the 14-day incidence rate of the disease had risen from a low of 2.5 cases per 100,000 people to 3.9 cases per 100,000 on Wednesday.“This virus is extremely infectious. It wants to spread but it wants people to come in contact with each other to do so,” he said. Dr Glynn said the R number was between 1.2 and 1.8, which means that for every five infected people, the disease will spread to between six and nine other people. He said there had been large clusters linked to private homes, in some cases infecting 40-50 people.The pause in lifting of restrictions marks the first time public officials have delayed reopening since the country first started to emerge from lockdown in May.Covid-19 figuresThe NPHET reported another two coronavirus-related deaths and 14 new confirmed cases, bringing to 145 cases over the past seven days. And the number of clusters – defined as two cases or more – in private homes increased by 96 in the week to last Sunday, according to figures from the State’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. Representatives of the pub trade reacted angrily to the Government’s decision describing the delay in the reopening of about 3,500 pubs as a “hammer blow” to the industry.Padraig Cribben, chief executive of the Vintners’ Federation of Ireland, said rural family-run pubs would bear the brunt of the decision. And Donall O’Keeffe, chief executive of the Licensed Vintners Association, said it was a “crushing blow” for pubs which will be unable to trade for 40 per cent of the year.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Makers of No Stone Unturned had been arrested for alleged theft of police documentsMiche\u0026aacutel Martin makes his first visit to Northern Ireland since his appointment4,900 proposed redundancies in North during coronavirus periodLeo Varadkar said re-opening depends on Covid-19 numbers as he faced angry TDsArchaeologists hope to have uncovered residences of early Ulster Kings in Co ArmaghVictim suffered neck and facial injuries from incident at Limerick house party in JuneVaradkar and Harris sound cautious note over unwinding of measuresCelebration for 500 people had been planned before Covid-19 restrictions extendedIncreasing proportion of these contacts are not coming forward for testing, briefing is toldDetective says he can connect accused with firearm through DNA evidenceNational Economic and Social Council sets out actions needed for sustainable recoveryFace coverings to become mandatory in shops and shopping centresQuantum computers could perform billions of times faster than current supercomputerThose who have recovered from coronavirus \u0026lsquounlikely\u0026rsquo to see impact on premiums or coverSwan owner Ronan Lynch brands decision to push back opening three weeks \u0026lsquoa disgrace\u0026rsquoFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader will seek to promote \u0026lsquopractical\u0026rsquo co-operation during delayed visitSector now \u0026lsquooverlooked\u0026rsquo as driving lessons brought foward in reopening planProcess to deal with claims cannot be established until new members chosenF\u0026aacuteilte Ireland director does not want tourists at his hotel who have not quarantinedStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4306141.1594903621!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus unwinding of latest stage of roadmap could be pushed back further","story":"Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told the Dáil pubs may remain closed beyond August 10th, the new date for the easing of the Covid-19 restrictions.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Harris: We can’t presume that Covid-19 is gone because it’s not. Photograph: Alan Betson  The The final phase of the Government’s roadmap to unlock the Irish economy from coronavirus restrictions may be pushed out beyond August 10th, senior ministers have warned.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told the Dáil pubs may remain closed beyond August 10th, the new date for the easing of the Covid-19 restrictions.Mr Varadkar said that pubs, nightclubs and other venues will open “no sooner than 10th August. We are not saying they will open on 10th August.”He stressed that it depends “on how the virus behaves” and the numbers of coronavirus cases which were rising, he told the Dáil as he faced angry rural TDs who condemned the decision announced on Wednesday.Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris also admitted earlier that phase four of the Government’s roadmap to reopen the country could be pushed back further if there is an increase in Covid-19 cases.The Government delayed the next reopening phase from the Covid-19 lockdown on Wednesday, postponing the reopening of remaining pubs and resumption of larger gatherings of people until August 10th.Mr Harris said this could be further postponed if cases continue to rise but added “I would hope that not to be the case.”“We can’t presume that Covid-19 is gone because it’s not,” Mr Harris said. The Minister also said the decision not to proceed with the next stage “increases the ability” to ensure children return to education in late August and early September.“I think it would have been a grossly irresponsible thing to ignore public health advice, to move forward with phase four in spite of the public health advice, knowing that we have a huge body of work to do as a country to get our kids back to school and indeed get our learners and students back into third level as well,” he told reporters on Thursday morning.Mr Harris said a “huge body of work” is being led by the Minister for Education Norma Foley to make sure schools can reopen at the end of next month. He said his department is finalising a framework for universities and colleges to reopen.The Minister echoed Mr Varadkar’s comments on Wednesday that the recent rise in Covid-19 cases in Ireland “is not a second wave”.“The Tánaiste is right, there isn’t an indication that there is a second wave here currently, but there are enough warning signs for us to press pause, try and bank the progress that we have made, and I suppose reignite the conversation with each other about the measures we need to take in terms of social distancing, hand washing, cough etiquette and keeping close contacts as minimum as we can,” Mr Harris said.“As of now the indicative date is August 10th but we’ve always been very honest with people. These are indicative dates and they entirely depend on the behaviour of the virus but we are not powerless in that regard,” he said.Mr Harris was speaking at the launch of the National Further Education and Training Strategy at Richmond Barracks in Dublin.Mr Harris said everybody wants to protect their own health and the health of students and staff but “equally we need to get people back to education”.“We can’t live in a country where we’ve nearly opened up everything else except our education sector. I think that would reflect very badly on our values as a country that values education and sees that the benefit of education runs far beyond just academic benefits too,” he said.The Minister also said the country is “absolutely open” to international students this coming semester. Mr Harris said he has heard from some universities that there are international students who would be willing to come to Ireland in September and quarantine for the recommended two-week period.Second waveEarlier Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it could “materially add to the possibility of a second wave” of the coronavirus of pubs reopened now.The Government would be prioritising the reopening of schools and healthcare facilities, the minister told Morning Ireland.The Government has delayed the next reopening phase from the Covid-19 lockdown, postponing the reopening of remaining pubs and resumption of larger gatherings of people amid concerns over rising coronavirus infections.Plans to allow pubs that do not serve food and nightclubs to recommence business from July 20th has been postponed until August 10th after the State’s health officials raised concerns about an increase in Covid-19 infections as restrictions have been relaxed.Proposals to permit larger gatherings of 100 people indoors, up from 50, and 500 people outdoors, up from 200, will also not proceed as earlier planned.Mr Donnelly also emphasised the need to get the R number down to below one. At present it is between 1.2 and 1.8, if that rate were to continue within three weeks the rate would be up to 150 cases per day, he warned.Mr Donnelly defended the Government’s decision, saying international evidence shows Covid-19 cases increase when pubs reopen. He said “nobody wants these restrictions in place”.He added that he hoped there would be no need for enforcement of wearing face covering in shops.The Minister said that the Government is taking Nphet advice to limit gatherings in homes to no more than 10 visitors.“It’s not 10 people, so if there’s five of you living in the house then you can be up to 15. Nphet have said for no more than four additional households which means essentially whoever lives in the house plus up to 10 people.”He said health are worried about clusters of cases.“What you can have is one person who is infected, but they are asymptomatic, they don’t know they are, they go to a house party, everyone’s talking loudly, there’s plenty of droplets going out into the air, you can end up with 20 to 30 people walking out of that house infected.”Mr Donnelly said the Government did not make the decision lightly.“But the public health advice is if we were to open now it could materially add to the possibility of a second wave and that’s just a risk we can take.”The lifting of the remaining restrictions would depend on the R rating he said. “It’s not one number, it’s not one fact, it’s in the round, where are we going, are we moving away from a second wave or are we moving towards a second wave.”Hospitality industryThe Government’s decision disappointed members of the hospitality industry.The president of the Irish Hotels Federation Elaina Fitzgerald Kane said “hitting the pause button” on the relaxation of Covid-19 regulations will put thousands of jobs at risk at a time when hotel room occupancy is only 30 per cent.The pause will also have an impact on people who had planned gatherings in hotels and wedding venues, she said.Around 18,000 couples this year will have their wedding day plans impacted by Covid-19 with many already changing their arrangements two to three times, she added.However, Infectious diseases consultant Corrina Sadlier has said the Government’s decision to pause the relaxing of the lockdown was the right thing to do.She said she understood this would cause extreme difficulties for the sectors affected, but “nothing about Covid-19 has been easy for anyone”.If the pause had not been implemented the country had been heading towards a second wave, she warned.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305477.1594843367!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"delayed reopening a kick in the teeth say devastated publicans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRonan Lynch, owner of The Swan on Aungier Street, Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe delay in allowing pubs to reopen has been described as “devastating” by a third-generation Dublin publican who said everything was already in place for a planned reopening next Monday.The Swan, on the corner of Aungier Street and York Street in Dublin 2, is one of a handful of Victorian pubs left in the city. Its owner, Ronan Lynch, said the decision was “a disgrace”.He pointed out that he had a range of health-and-safety measures planned including social distancing and hand sanitisation stations and strict guidelines for staff to follow.He accused the Government of failing to even discuss any details of the measures already taken and those which were still required with the industry.“This is absolutely devastating,” he said. “We have been closed for 18 weeks and were the first and hardest hit sector . We all have financial commitments and things are just going to get harder and harder. It is so frustrating because we have not had any communication from Government as to what more we need to do.”He said the successful reopening at the end of June of pubs that serve food had given the sector great confidence that the remaining pubs would be facilitated from Monday, which made the news even harder to swallow.“There has been no dialogue from Government, it has been appalling, and we will end up being closed for 40 per cent of the year. We missed St Patrick’s Day, the end of the football and rugby season, all other sports and the tourist season, and on top of all that we have Brexit coming down the tracks.”He said what made it harder to understand was that publicans were already accustomed to managing customers better than most other sectors and knew how to control their space in a responsible fashion.‘Devastation’His views were echoed by others in the pub trade.“It is just devastation for us, the work we have put in to be ready for Monday for them to simply say we can’t reopen for another three weeks,” said Paul Moynihan of Moynihan’s Bar in Donard, Co Wicklow. “And it will be devastating for our customers too.”He pointed out that house parties and other social gatherings would continue where there would be few guidelines followed, “and yet we are the ones being kicked in the teeth”.“I can’t fathom it. Even on a personal level I was really looking forward to seeing our customers again, and we would have been well able to control it, but nobody appears to be listening to us.”Walsh’s pub in Stoneybatter has reconfigured its operation so it can reopen as planned on Monday.“The delay is simply not fair on so many pubs,” owner Anthony Malone said. “We were concerned this might happen and have been planning to offer food, and that is what we will do.

Actual excavation at the site would require significant funding, according to the academics.Dr John O’Keeffe, principal inspector of historic monuments in the Department for Communities, said the department was pleased to facilitate the survey work at Navan Fort. The fort is owned by the department and is one of 190 state care monuments in Northern Ireland managed by the department.Queen’s academics said the current work has shone new light on the monument, and for years to come will inform further research as they “explore what Navan Fort meant to our forebears and how they used the site”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4306217.1594909142!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"psni apologises to journalists trevor birney and barry mccaffrey","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBarry McCaffrey (left) and Trevor Birney outside Belfast High Court. File photograph: Liam McBurneyPA Wire Northern Ireland’s police chief has made an unreserved apology to two journalists arrested over material that appeared in a documentary on a Troubles massacre.Simon Byrne wrote to Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey to apologise after the Court of Appeal quashed a search warrant used to raid their homes and offices in August 2018.Mr McCaffrey and Mr Birney were arrested over the alleged theft of a police watchdog document that appeared in their film No Stone Unturned on a notorious loyalist massacre in Loughinisland during the Troubles.Six men were shot dead while watching football in a pub in the Co Down village in the summer of 1994.The investigation into the documentary makers was later dropped.As the investigation had involved a Police Ombudsman document, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had asked Durham Constabulary to direct the raids in August 2018, to avoid a conflict of interest.Mr Byrne, who sent separate letters to the men on Thursday, acknowledged that Durham Constabulary was acting on the PSNI’s behalf.In the letter to Mr Birney, he wrote: “I am writing to you on behalf of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to place on record my unreserved apology to you and your family for the distress and upset caused by the execution of search warrants at your home and business premises on August 31st, 2018.“Whilst the searches were planned and conducted at the direction of officers from Durham Constabulary, those officers were acting on behalf of the Police Service of Northern Ireland in an external capacity and I fully accept the ruling of the Lord Chief Justices that the search warrants were unlawful.“I can assure you that the Police Service of Northern Ireland will be reviewing all of the findings of the judgment to ensure that all appropriate learning is taken.“I have already notified your legal representatives that I am keen to resolve all outstanding matters through a process of mediation in order to bring this matter to a conclusion.”Last year judges ruled search warrants used by police had been “inappropriate”.This resulted in the criminal probe into the journalists being discontinued.Last Friday, a panel of judges sitting in the Court of Appeal ruled the conduct of the hearing to obtain the search warrant fell “woefully short” of the standard required to ensure that the hearing was fair.The lord chief justice Sir Declan Morgan told the court that the journalists had at all times acted as investigative reporters adhering to their professional code.“We see no overriding requirement in the public interest which could have justified an interference with the protection of journalistic sources in this case,” he said.Mr McCaffrey welcomed the apology.“I welcome this unreserved apology from Mr Byrne on behalf of the PSNI.“It’s unfortunate that it has taken the PSNI 685 days to do the right thing and finally apologise since they raided our homes at 7am on August 31st 2018.“The chief constable says the PSNI will look at what lessons need to be learned. I sincerely hope it does. I think it’s obvious that this was a lesson on how not to do policing in a democratic society. This was a deliberate and direct attack on press freedom.“On the morning of our arrest, the police publicly accused us of having put people’s lives at risk. This was an outrageous slur on our personal and professional reputations. The lord chief justice Sir Declan Morgan made it clear in his judgment that this was completely untrue and without foundation.“We have had to live for the last two years with that highly damaging slur hanging over our heads. Who in the PSNI is going to be held to account?“The court found that there was indeed unlawful and illegal actions in this case, but it wasn’t by Trevor Birney or myself. It was by the PSNI and Durham Constabulary.”Mr McCaffrey said senior police officers involved in the operation would not be held to account.“Who is going to be held to account for the hundreds of thousands of pounds that was wasted in this case? Where is the accountability?” he asked.Outstanding issuesMr Birney’s solicitor Niall Murphy said there remained serious outstanding issues to address, including the PSNI retention of data seized.“Mr Birney welcomes this morning’s unreserved apology,” he said.“He is, however, conscious that actions speak louder than words and look forward to the words being met with decisive reparative action in the upcoming mediation between the parties, a matter which the Chief Constable personally referenced in the apology.“There remains serious issues to be addressed in relation to the PSNI’s illegal retention of massive swathes of Mr Birney’s data, his unlawful arrest, wrongful detention and the impact it has had on his business.“He is determined that the PSNI and Durham officers who instigated and overseen his unlawful arrest and detention are held to account.“In meantime, he looks forward positively to the mediation to hopefully conclude this sorry episode in the days ahead.”Mr McCaffrey added: “Unfortunately, even though the court found that the PSNI unlawfully obtained our personal data, they still refuse to delete the confidential material belonging to us which they still retain.“They say they want to hold on to this material, even though it was obtained illegally, for 10 years. Why is that?“This isn’t North Korea, this is supposed to be the north of Ireland 2020.“What rights and protections does an inidual have if the PSNI is allowed to retain unlawfully obtained material for a decade?“While I welcome the chief constable’s apology, I feel this sorry chapter in bad policing cannot be properly resolved until this issue of data protection is dealt with fully.“The police had a job to do, to catch the Loughinisland killers, today I hope they now finally get around to doing this.”\u0026nbsp- PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305505.1594846205!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barry cowen sacking could cause major fianna f%C3%A1il rift tds say","story":"Minister for Agriculture Barry Cowen has been sacked by Taoiseach Micheál Martin who told the Dáil that the Offaly TD would no longer serve in Cabinet arising from continuing controversy over his drink-driving conviction.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe dismissal of Barry Cowen as Minister for Agriculture by Taoiseach Micheál Martin has the potential to cause a serious rift in the parliamentary party, its TDs have said.In the Dáil on Wednesday Mr Martin strongly stood over his decision to sack Mr Cowen on Tuesday night after the latter refused to make a further statement on the drink-driving ban he received in 2016.But in a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the Taoiseach and his decision to sack him, Mr Cowen told Fianna Fáil activists in his constituency that the party was “definitely bigger” than Mr Martin.“FF is bigger than me. It’s definitely bigger than M Martin. I have apologised for my actions. I made a stupid mistake but I did not do what they have accused me of,” he texted.The Taoiseach also told the Dáil he had “never sought in any shape or form to undermine . . . the accuracy or credibility of any Garda statement on the file”.That put his position on the Garda Pulse report of the incident directly at odds with that of Mr Cowen. The Offaly TD has strongly refuted a statement in the report that he tried to evade a Garda checkpoint.The  understands the Garda Pulse record is brief and says Mr Cowen turned his car off the road ahead of gardaí up ahead.It suggests that when the gardaí went to check where his car had gone, they engaged him in conversation and detected the drink-driving offence.No vettingGardaí have also said they process requests for access to personal data without preferential treatment and do not carry out ministerial vetting.Fianna Fáil TDs contacted yesterday said as many as a third of the party’s members would be sceptical of, or openly opposed to, Mr Martin’s leadership. One said a substantial minority believed the coalition with Fine Gael could lead to the ruination of the party.Another TD said: “Those outside the fold believe Micheál is a spent docket. The only question is: will there be a challenge to him sooner rather than later?”In a move widely expected, deputy leader Dara Calleary was appointed new Minister for Agriculture. Dublin West TD Jack Chambers has been named as Mr Calleary’s successor as chief whip with responsibility for the Gaeltacht. In a tweet he promised to work hard to improve his Irish.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe There is an apocryphal rule often attributed to Tony Blair’s former spokesman Alastair Campbell that if a politician continues to be mired in controversy a fortnight after the story first breaks then he or she will have to walk the plank.The saga that concluded with the demise of Barry Cowen’s short-lived ministerial career did not last quite so long - 12 days. However, it did follow an arc very similar to that of previous minsters who were sacked, or forced to resign, such as Alan Shatter and Frances Fitzgerald.Friday, July 3rd:Rumours have been circulating for some days about a drinking ban that Cowen had in the past. Both Cowen’s office and that of Taoiseach Micheál Martin are contacted by the Irish Independent with records purporting to show that Cowen was given a three-month ban for drink-driving in 2016 and also received a €200 fine. It is the first that Martin has known of the offence.Saturday, July 4th:The report is published. It also emerges that Cowen (49) was driving on a provisional licence and had been for some years. He issues a statement saying he is “profoundly sorry”. He also lets it be known he now has a full driving licence but does not disclose when he made the test.Sunday, July 5th:The situation has now become a crisis for Fianna Fáil. The party has earlier had to contend with internal ructions over ministerial appointments. Cowen, in the first of a series of apologies, is a guest on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics.He makes a candid apology. “The fact of the matter was it was a terribly stupid, stupid, mistake on my part,” he says. “It is something that I am very regretful for.”He admits that he had driven unaccompanied on occasions when on a learner permit and says, in hindsight, maybe he should have informed Micheál Martin at the time.Paul Murphy, the Rise TD, says it is “bizarre” that anybody who is close to 50 did not have a full licence.Further stories emerge about a speeding ticket and another minor road traffic infractions, seemingly gleaned from a Garda Pulse report.Monday, July 6th:Amid persistent demands from the Opposition for more clarity, it emerges that Cowen has contacted the Ceann Comhairle asking to make a personal statement on the matter in the Dáil. It is agreed he will speak the following day.Micheál Martin seems reassured by Cowen’s apology and explanation for not contacting him earlier. “He was deeply ashamed of it and embarrassed that the incident occurred in 2016,” he says.Tuesday July 7th:Cowen makes a personal statement in the Dáil at 9pm. He again apologises about his “stupid mistake”.He explains for the first time the details of his drink-driving arrest. It happened on the day of the All Ireland football final. He was stopped in Co Kildare as he was returning to Co Offaly with a friend.“Before the match I consumed two drinks and following the game had a light meal before driving home to Offaly. On the way to drop my friend home I was stopped by gardaí and asked to participate in a Breathalyser test. I did so, and both this test and a subsequent test at a local Garda station confirmed that I was over the legal alcohol limit.”While he was on a provisional licence at the time, he says “I subsequently secured and now hold a full clean driving licence.“Before reform it was not uncommon for people of all ages and experience to be on a provisional licence.”He also says he has spoken to a number of road safety campaigners earlier that day including Susan Gray of Parc. He says he had apologised to them.But Gray later criticises Cowen, saying he failed to address various aspects of his driving licence. She and others call for him to specify how many learner permits he held, and if he displayed “L” or “N” plates on his car.Sunday, July 12th:The controversy seems to have receded a bit. However, The Sunday Times now reports details of the Garda record of the September 2016 incident which alleges the Offaly TD was pursed by gardaí after doing a U-turn before a Garda checkpoint.Cowen begins a robust defence. He claims the Garda record is “incorrect” and says the fact that gardaí leaked a Pulse record was an act of criminality.He states that he had never evaded or avoided a Garda checkpoint. “I did not evade or attempt to evade a garda. Such an act would constitute a serious criminal offence,” he says.It was, arguably, a more serious offence than the drink-driving ban. Under Section 109 of the Road Traffic Act failure to stop a vehicle when required by a Garda is a criminal offence, punishable by fine, andor imprisonment.The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (Gsoc) is asked by the Garda to investigate the circumstances in which the confidential Garda Pulse record of the incident was leaked to the media.Other details are now emerging. It is clear that copies of the Garda Pulse record had been leaked to reporters at least ten days before then. And the record contained the allegation that Cowen had tried to avoid the checkpoint.This allegation of evasion had been put to Cowen and to Fianna Fáil as early as July 3rd, nine days beforehand. However, Cowen had denied it very strenuously. It had not appeared in earlier media reports and Cowen himself had made no reference to it.The previous week Martin had briefed Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Green leader Eamon Ryan on the incident but had made no mention of the alleged evasion of the checkpoint. Varadkar had said he did not want any more surprises.Monday, July 13th:Perhaps the day that sealed Barry Cowen’s fate. Asked for comment by RTÉ’s Midlands Correspondent Ciarán Mulooly, Cowen says that under legal advice he was not making any further comment until such time as Gsoc issued its report.Varadkar is interviewed on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. He refers to his comments from the previous week where he wanted no more surprises and then refers to the new revelations. However, the thrust of his interview is calibrated. He does not call for a head and seems to accept that perhaps allowing the Gsoc investigation to follow its course might be the preferable option.Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin, speaking on Newstalk, says Cowen needs to clarify matters further.That is the theme being pursued by the Opposition parties who are asking Cowen to make a new statement and also to answer questions in the Dáil. Sinn Féin’s Louise O’Reilly says the fact there was a dispute between his account and that of the Garda record showed the need for him to answer questions in the Dáil.\u0026nbsp“He has said he wants to draw a line under it, the Taoiseach says he wants to draw a line under it. Clearly a line has not been drawn under it. We are still talking about it now ten days after it was first revealed.”The previous week, Cowen had requested and received the Pulse report of the incident from the Garda. He and Martin have a lengthy conversation on Monday night about the record. Martin asks to see it.As questions are raised about the source of the leaks, the Meath East TD Thomas Byrne rejects suggestions that he had tipped off the media about Cowen’s run-in with the Garda.“There’s a civil matter in relation to this. It does not involve me. I’m on good terms with Barry Cowen,” he tells LMFM in an interview.Tuesday July 14th:Micheál Martin and Cowen meet to further discuss the matter. Cowen shows Martin the Pulse report, which suggests a more benign interpretation of events than had been portrayed by the media.Martin lets Cowen know that in his view a “comprehensive statement was required” and that he as Minister and an office holder was obliged to come before the House to explain himself.“In my view, the issue could only be resolved with the political route.”Martin tells Cowen it does not have to be on Tuesday, or even Wednesday but at some stage a comprehensive statement is required.At around 11.30am, Martin meets Varadkar and Ryan and tells them that Cowen has said he will make no further statement and he has had asked him to reflect on his position. Both said they agreed with his position and would support what decision he would make.Sources in both parties insist that neither forced the issue in any way or “sought a head on a plate”.“I thought when the Taoiseach went in at 2pm he was actually going to announce that Cowen was gone,” said one.In the event, Martin gave a partial defence of Cowen under questioning in the Dáil from Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald. Again he referred to some ambiguity in the Pulse record.“I saw the document myself this morning and having seen it, I can say that it is not quite as it has been portrayed. \u0026nbspNonetheless, the document is there.”In those sentences, he was outlining the problem (the Pulse document existed and needed to be explained) and the possible solution for Cowen (a more benign reading of it).But it needed Cowen to agree to make a fresh statement before the Dáil and answer questions.Shortly after Leaders’ Questions Martin went to the canteen in Leinster House and spoke casually to journalists. He pointed out that the statement made no explicit reference to a “U-turn”. It seemed to suggest that he was still holding out hope Cowen would change his mind.The relatively spirited defence of Cowen, plus the refusal to allow a statement, suggested that the Government was holding a line and was now prepared to weather out the controversy. Those with experience of previous occasions when office holders were sacked or resigned were familiar with the temporal arc. The controversy would reach a point where the pressure was so unbearable and the clamour so frenzied that the Minister was holding on by a thread. One more sliver of trouble would be enough to topple him or her.As one former Fine Gael minister said on Tuesday: “It had not reached that point. It was much too early. Nobody had any expectation that he was about to get sacked.”And that’s why it took so many by surprise. Just before 9pm, Martin went to the Dáil to announce he had sacked Cowen over his refusal to make a further statement. He said there were questions that needed clarification and it was not tenable for other Ministers to provide a proxy for Cowen by trying to answer them.So what happened in the intervening seven hours? Well, it seemed that well before 2pm, Martin had already made up his mind that Cowen had to go if he refused to make a second statement.His defence of him in the Dáil was affording the Offaly TD a final chance to address the issues. Later that afternoon he formally asked Cowen to reconsider. Cowen refused. He then asked him to resign. He refused. The plank was now readied.Within half an hour of the bombshell, Cowen responded with a lengthy statement on Twitter, with a direct cut at Martin for sacking him only seven hours after backing him.“Ten days ago and this afternoon the Taoiseach believed my failure of 2016 didn’t warrant my removal from office but he now appears to have changed his mind based on a Pulse report I gave him this morning.“Unfortunately the decision of the Taoiseach to remove me from office, when he supported me this afternoon in the Dáil, has undermined and potentially prejudiced my entitlement to fair process,” he said.Publicly, Fianna Fáil TDs strongly backed the Taoiseach’s decision, praising him for being decisive. They also expressed personal sympathy for Cowen, who is popular and respected by his colleagues.Wednesday July 15th:Martin’s disposition was matter-of-fact and unruffled during Leaders Questions in the Dáil’s temporary home of the National Convention Centre. He refuted Mary Lou McDonald’s claim that he (Martin) challenged the Garda report, arguing that he had never done that, and that was why he expected Cowen to make a clarification.Cowen arrives at the centre and goes into the chamber. He is seen talking to John McGuinness and, later, to Eamon O Cuív. They may be chance encounters but they underline the potential split within the party. Backbench TDs in the canteen are bemused - they refer to it as the worst possible start in Government.Nobody quibbles when Dara Calleary is announced as the new Minister.Martin continues to face questions about the matter from Opposition TDs. However, as the day continues, it is the Apple judgement that begins to dominate the agenda. A potential crisis has been allayed for now."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Two other teenagers who ate meat from same infected animal being treated with antibioticsAlmost 4cm-long nematode roundworm is thought to have come from raw fishThousands displaced after heavy rains trigger flash floodingMove after Japan\u0026rsquos capital records highest daily cases \u0026ndash 224 \u0026ndash since pandemic beganInfluential sister of Kim Jong-un says meeting makes no sense without reward for PyongyangMayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Cases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4302587.1594542601!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk government announces 700m for britain eu border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.

However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4306070.1594892986!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us is sliding into conflict with china with eerily little debate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Donald Trump and his China counterpart Xi Jinping at a business leaders’ event in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in November, 2017. Photograph: Nicolas AsfouriAFP via Getty ImagesFerocious partisanship has its uses. If nothing else, a ided nation can console itself that no government idea goes unexamined and unopposed. Scrutiny can be all the more exacting for being born of tribal malice rather than Socratic truth-seeking. The US is riven – it has managed to politicise the workaday face-mask – but it avoids the equal and opposite danger of unreflective consensus.Except, that is, on the most momentous policy of the century. To be in Washington is to sense a nation sliding into open-ended conflict against China with eerily little debate. Politicians who can be counted on to dispute the colour of the sky or the sum of two plus two are of a piece on the necessity of a superpower duel. In the Rambo trailers that pass for his campaign ads, Joe Biden faults President Donald Trump’s China line only for its softness.Nor is the Democratic candidate for the White House a rare belligerent in his party. Chuck Schumer, who leads it in the Senate, has urged the president to “hang tough” on tariffs for “strength is the only way to win with China”. He was not pressed to say what in the historic record justifies this coffee-mug banality, or against which nation he would ever counsel weakness. No, that would require debate. Neither in Washington nor in the corporate sector is there much to be found, at least on the record. Academics have been more forthcoming with their qualms, but not in great number or to great effect.The result is that un-American thing, consensus, and it concerns not just the future but increasingly the past. Everyone now “knows” that pre-Trump Washington was a place of Whiggish credulity, forever betting on material enrichment to make of China a vast Japan or South Korea: a democracy, a friend. In this account, its admittance to the World Trade Organisation was the inadvertent crowning of a rival by American enablers.Leave aside the slander against presidents from George HW Bush (who defied Beijing to arm Taiwan) to Barack Obama (who put tariffs on Chinese tyres). Leave aside the idea that America’s only options are liberal naïvéte and a second cold war. As in the 1940s, when the US was said to have “lost” China to communism, the premise here is that Earth’s most populous country, and oldest living civilisation, rises and falls in response to US policy. That it has agency of its own, that its post-1978 reforms were going to restore its stature anyway is, in Washington, a more exotic suggestion than it should be.Minority reportsNone of this is a plea for (how easily the Soviet-era patter returns) detente. It might be that a US-China struggle is not just defensible, but ordained. We know the international-relations theory by now. A surging power, an established one a one-party state, a democracy: the raw materials for conflict are there. But it is possible to believe all this and still feel unnerved by the lack of public deliberation and prominent dissenters. Even at the dawn of the cold war, there was Senator Robert Taft to argue against Nato. There was diplomat George Kennan, the 20th century’s most unwittingly important man, who viewed “containment” as a bellicose misreading of his advice. And these minority reports were filed in a much more deferential America than today’s.The absence of such voices now is disconcerting. For it means that policy is not being refined and stress-tested through argument. It is no longer clear, for instance, if US grievances stop at China’s trade practices or reach into its domestic treatment of its own people. Mikes Pence and Pompeo, the vice-president and secretary of state, flag the second more often than Trump does. Democrats mention it more than Republicans. This mission creep, if it is afoot, rather matters. An economic rivalry would be fraught enough. One that pits governing philosophies against each other is much harder to finesse.Another implication of the consensus is that dissent is becoming a political no-no. There is a dark past to contend with here. It is forgotten that McCarthyism’s breakthrough had little to do with Russia. It was that alleged loss of China. American diplomats were hounded by their own lawmakers (the right mastered cancel culture first). When President Harry Truman cashiered general Douglas MacArthur, who itched to strike China, not everyone sided with civilian over military power.Washington now is nowhere near that level of frenzy. Even by the standards of an election year, though, the reluctance to say anything construable as “soft” is impossible to miss. America’s ultimate advantage is the raucousness of its public discourse. On the China question, it is troublingly civilised. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Read more about the Donald Trump administrationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"amber heard regularly violent johnny depp says head security","story":" Johnny Depp’s former fiancee Winona Ryder and his ex-wife Vanessa Paradis have both described him as a kind and loving man who had never been violent towards them.In witness statements released by the High Court as part of a libel case by Mr Depp against the Sun newspaper and its publisher, the two A-list stars said they did not recognise the picture of him painted by his former wife Amber Heard as a violent drug and drink-fuelled abuser.Ms Ryder, 48, who recently starred in Stranger Things and who had a relationship with Mr Depp in the 1990s, stated: The idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved. I cannot wrap my head around these accusations. He was never, never violent towards me. He was never, never abusive at all towards me. He has never been violent or abusive towards anybody I have seen.”Ms Paradis, who was married to Mr Depp and had two children with him before he left her for Ms Heard, said:  “This is nothing like the true Johnny I have known, and from my personal experience of many years, I can say he was never violent or abusive to me.”She added: “I have seen that these outrageous statements have been really distressing, and also caused damage to his career because unfortunately people have gone on believing these false facts. This is so upsetting as he has helped so many persons in his personal and professional life, with kindness and generosity.”In an unusual move the two women will not be called as witnesses in the high profile case, meaning the pair will not be cross-examined over their support of Mr Depp case against The Sun’s description of him as a “wife beater”.The dramatic release of the witness statements came on the eight day of the actor’s case against The Sun’s publisher, News Group Newspapers (NGN), and its executive editor Dan Wootton over an article from April 2018 alleging he was violent towards Ms Heard, 34, during and even before their marriage.Both Ms Ryder and Ms Paradis had been due to appear via video link in order to answer questions about their evidence.However Mr Depp’s lawyers said there was no need to call them since the case did not rest on whether the actor was violent to other women but only against Ms Heard.NGN’s barrister, Sasha Wass QC, said she would have wished to question Ms Ryder and Ms Paradis under oath had they been called to give evidence.She told the court: “They are character witnesses for Mr Depp and we would wish to cross examine them.”Mr Justice Nicol ruled that because selected extracts from both Ms Ryder and Ms Paradis’s statements had been read in open court at a preliminary hearing in the case, they could be made public.In her statement Ms Ryder says:  “I understand that it is very important that I speak from my own experience, as I obviously was not there during his marriage to Amber, but, from my experience, which was so wildly different, I was absolutely shocked, confused and upset when I heard the accusations against him.” “I truly and honestly only know him as a really good man - an incredibly loving, extremely caring guy who was so very protective of me and the people that he loves, and I felt so very, very safe with him. “I do not want to call anyone a liar but from my experience of Johnny, it is impossible to believe that such horrific allegations are true. I find it extremely upsetting knowing him as I do.”Ms Paradis, who was married to Mr Depp between 1998 and 2012, states: “ I have known Johnny for more than 25 years. We’ve been partners for 14 years and we raised our two children together. Through all these years I’ve known Johnny to be a kind, attentive, generous, and non-violent person and father. “On movie sets the actors, directors and entire crews adore him because he is humble and respectful to everyone, as well as being one of the best actors we’ve seen.”The court had previously heard Mr Depp had a Winona Forever tattoo when the pair were together, which he later changed to Wino Forever and which Ms Heard is alleged to have mocked in light of him failing to give up drink and drugs.One of worst of the 14 incidents of violence alleged by Ms Heard was a three-day ordeal of physical and verbal abuse inflicted on her by Mr Depp while he was high on drink and drugs during the filming of Pirates of the Caribbean in Australia.The actor allegedly smashed Amber Heard’s head against a fridge twice, slapped her and threatened to stub a cigarette out on his own face, during a sustained period of violence in March 2015. The actor’s drug and drink fuelled rage allegedly culminated in him smashing up the rented house he was sharing with Ms Heard, destroying furniture, smashing a window and painting graffiti on walls and mirrors.It is claimed his rage was such that he cut his finger off while destroying the house and wrote some of the graffiti in his own blood.Mr Depp denies ever being violent with Ms Heard and claims that she severed his finger by throwing a bottle of vodka at him.Johnny Depp\u0027s head of security for 14 years has claimed that Amber Heard was violent to the Hollywood star on multiple occasions and that his security team would have to protect him from her abusive behaviour.Sean Bett told a libel hearing at the High Court that Ms Heard\u0027s abuse of her husband became a recurring cycle during their relationship.He told the court in a witness statement: Throughout the course of Mr Depp and Ms Heard\u0027 s relationship, Ms Heard was verbally and physically abusive towards Mr Depp. On many occasions, I witnessed her shout at Mr Depp. I was also told by Mr Depp on multiple occasions that Ms Heard had physically abused him.Mr Bett added: A very common occurrence throughout the relationship would be that Mr Depp would have me, and other members of his security team, take him away from Ms Heard, due to her behavior. He would then stay somewhere else. This happened on so many occasions that it is not possible for me to remember them all in detail. However, I would describe it as a recurring cycle that Ms Heard would abuse Mr Depp, who would then remove himself from the situation.Mr Depp denies ever hitting Ms Heard or being abusive towards her.Appearing in support of the actor Mr Bett, a former officer at Los Angeles County Sheriff\u0027s Department, said problems would frequently arise from Ms Heard\u0027s habit of drinking large quantities of red wine.He said: Ms Heard often behaved in this way when she had been drinking. I learnt quickly to recognize the signs, so that we were able to leave the situation before it escalated further. I also knew that she could be violent towards Mr Depp, so it was important that he did not remain in a situation with Ms Heard when she was in this kind of abusive mood.Mr Bett, who admitted in court that he found Ms Heard to be perfectly polite when he was on his own with her without Mr Depp, said he had never seen the actor physically abusing his wife or anyone else.He said: “I have never seen Mr Depp being violent to anyone including Ms Heard during the long period I have been working for him. In addition, I have observed Ms Heard throwing bottles, glasses and other objects at Mr Depp while being verbally abusive towards him. As a rule, during these episodes Mr Depp remains fairly passive and either tries to calm Ms Heard down or remove himself from the situation.Mr Bett told the court he took a number of photographs of injuries to Mr Depp which he claims were caused by Ms Heard, including one showing a red mark to his cheek taken in March 2015, and another showing a scratch and reddening around his nose, taken in December 2015.He said the photograph was taken after “Mr Depp said Ms Heard slapped him in the face”.Mr Bett told the court that following the couple’s arguments he would sometimes be asked by Mr Depp to drive Ms Heard home to the Eastern Columbia Buildings from his Sweetzer Avenue property in Los Angeles, to make sure she got home safely.The bodyguard said: During these times she would be crying, saying how much she loved Mr Depp and she\u0027s tired of the arguing, and I would tell her, \u0027well this has to stop between you two\u0027.He told the court that he did not see any marks or bruises on her during these journeys.Sasha Wass QC, NGN\u0027s barrister, suggested Mr Bett was lying about the lack of visible injuries on Ms Heard\u0027s face. She had visible reddening, she said.Mr Bett responded: You can call me a liar 100 times. I\u0027m not, I\u0027m telling the truth.The actor\u0027s legal team decided on Thursday they would not need to call actresses Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis.Mr Depp’s former partners were due to give evidence over a video link but his barrister David Sherborne said there was no need to call them since the defendants’ case is that the actor was violent to Ms Heard and not other women.He told the court: There is no need to reschedule those witnesses, much as it would have been a pleasure to have them here.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"danish ice cream maker drops eskimo name avoiding offending","story":"A Danish ice-cream company has said it will rename one of its classic varieties due to the potential for the name “Eskimo” to cause offense to the native people of Greenland.After initial reluctance to change the name of its vanilla and chocolate offering, “a process of dialogue and reflection made it clear to us that people feel the name Eskimo reminds them of a past of degradation and unfair treatment,” Hansen’s ice cream maker said in a statement.The company remarked that the name Eskimo had been used throughout its 100-year history, but that a recent debate about unfair treatment of indigenous people had prompted a change of heart.Eskimo is popularly used in Denmark as a name for vanilla ice cream coated in chocolate. Another ice cream company, Premier, has resisted pressure to change the name of its “Giant Eskimo” variety.Meanwhile a chocolatier in the town of Fredriksberg has refused to alter its menu after finding itself at  the centre of a social media storm for selling waffles covered in “Eskimo” ice cream.Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, one of two MPs for Greenland in the Danish parliament, welcomed Hansen’s name change. Eskimo has a pejorative meaning for many Greenlanders. So I think it is only natural to show this level of respect for us, she said.While the exact origin of the word Eskimo remains unclear, a reason commonly given for its offensiveness - that it means “eater of raw meat” - is now largely discredited.More likely, it comes from the French esquimaux, meaning one who nets snowshoes. Many of the indigenous people of the Arctic region of North America prefer the word Inuit, meaning “people”. Others, particularly natives of Alaska, continue to refer to themselves as Eskimos, as Inuit has no meaning in their language. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal navy submarine stena ferry came within 100m colliding","story":"The third near miss in four years between a Royal Navy submarine and a civilian vessel has sparked “significant concern” from investigators.A report into the incident between a submerged submarine and a Stena ferry, says that without the “great presence of mind” of a crew member on the civilian craft, there was a significant chance of a collision.The near miss, on November 6, 2018, occurred in the busy waterway between Belfast and Cairnryan.The Officer of the Watch on the Stena Superfast VII was forced to take action to avoid collision with the submerged submarine that had been spotted at close range ahead of the ferry.As the ferry turned hard to port the submarine maintained its course and passed across the Stena Superfast VII’s bows. It was photographed close to the starboard side of the ferry.The report says the two vessels could have been within 100m of each other as the ferry, which had 282 passengers and crew on board, took the avoiding action.Although aware of the ferry, the submarine’s control room team had overestimated the civilian craft’s range and underestimated its speed. The report by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said the submarine’s commanding officer and its officer of the watch made safety-critical decisions that\u2028”might have appeared rational to them at the time” but were actually based on inaccurate information. The report cited two previous collisions between Royal Navy submarines and surface vessels in recent years. In all three incidents key decisions on board the submarines were made based on “an insufficient appreciation of the location of surface ships in the vicinity” the report said. The Stena Superfast VII ferry was just over 200m long and weighed 30,285 tons. Given a closing speed of around 27 knots between the two vessels there was every chance that the ferry would have suffered significant underwater damage had a collision occurred.It is not known if the Royal Navy vessel was an Astute or Trafalgar Class hunter killer boat, or one of the four Vanguard Class nuclear-armed deterrent submarines. There were no nuclear safety issues during the near miss.The report said there is no expectation that the bridge team of a merchant ship should be able to detect or avoid a submerged submarine. The investigation board said it was “extremely fortunate” that Stena Superfast VII’s lookout spotted the submarine’s periscope.The  understands the Royal Navy has accepted in full the recommendations of the report. A thorough safety investigation in 2018 identified the necessary actions to prevent a re-occurrence and these have now been enacted by the Navy and explained to the MAIB. Administrative action was taken against at least one member of the submarine’s crew rather than disciplinary proceedings. The MoD said it would be “inappropriate to comment any further on inidual cases”.The incident is the third in four years involving Royal Navy submarines and civilian vessels.On 15 April 15, 2015, a submarine was deep in the Irish Sea when it snagged the fishing vessel Karen’s trawl wires. Karen was dragged backwards at about seven knots and partially submerged before the trawl wires snapped.On 20 July 20, 2016 the Royal Navy attack submarine, HMS Ambush, collided with the merchant vessel Andreas near Gibraltar.HMS Ambush was at periscope depth and conducting tactical training exercises at the time. A subsequent investigation found the crew were not maintaining a continuous all-round look to reduce the risk of detection in a simulated threat environment. The report stated the key common factor between the latest incident and two previous collisions involving submerged Royal Navy submarines was the absence of a sufficiently accurate plot of surface shipping, a critical factor to ensure sound decision-making.A Royal Navy Spokesperson said: “Ensuring safety at sea is a top priority for the Royal Navy, which is why we welcome this report and have already taken action to tighten our training and procedures.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/28/18/credit.jpg","title":"uk unemployment rate payroll latest coronavirus","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Hours worked fall at record rate while job vacancies disappear as nation prepares for unemployment to hit 4 million this yearThe number of paid employees in the UK fell by 649,000 between March and June, while job vacancies disappeared, official figures show.  Early estimates showed there were 1.9 per cent less people on employers\u0027 payrolls in June compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said. Unemployment fell 17,000 between March and May to 1.35 million, leaving the official rate unchanged at 3.9 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, experts warned that the jobs figures masked the true scale of the crisis. The number of hours worked dropped at the fastest pace on record, suggesting that the headline unemployment is an underestimate.Average weekly hours worked per person fell to a record low of 26.6 between March and May, down by 5.5 hours on the same period a year ago. Weekly data show that hours worked began to recover in May, with self-employed people seeing a significant rise in work.Can we trust the predictions for Britain’s economy?Job vacancies fell to 333,000 between April and June - almost two-thirds lower than in the same period last year and the lowest level since the ONS began collecting comparable data in 2001.The claimant count, which includes people on universal credit or jobseeker\u0027s allowance, more than doubled between March and May to 1.4 million, before levelling off in June.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said: As the pandemic took hold, the labour market weakened markedly, but that rate of decline slowed into June, though this is before recent reports of job losses.There are now almost two-thirds of a million fewer employees on the payroll than before the lockdown, according to the latest tax data.The Labour Force Survey is showing only a small fall in employment, but shows a large number of people who report working no hours and getting no pay.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The number of people temporarily away from work dropped from a peak of  8.8 million in April to 6.3 million by the end of May.That figure is likely to have continued to rise as non-essential retailers, pubs and restaurants - all big employers - began to re-open in June.However, almost a third of businesses plan to cut staff in the next three months, according to a survey this week by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) found.Government plans to slow the expected surge in joblessness have attracted criticism, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies labelling them badly timed and poorly targeted.Last week Rishi Sunak announced subsidies for restaurant meals, a VAT cut for hospitality firms and a £1,000 bonus for each furloughed employee brought back into work and kept on until January.The chancellor conceded on Wednesday that much of the furlough bonus was dead weight, meaning it would be wasted on paying employers for workers they had intended to keep on anyway.John Phillips, GMB acting general secretary, said: “Without further Government action, the risk is the cuts to jobs and wages so far will just be the tip of an iceberg that crushes livelihoods and crashes our economy.  “The response from this recession cannot be like the last if we are to recover.  “This country cannot endure another decade of weak growth and cuts to services - we need a Government prepared to make bold investment in jobs, skills and industries.“Business Secretary Alok Sharma said many people are facing a very, very difficult time, following the publication of the latest unemployment figures.I think the best thing we can do is continue to open up the economy in a phased manner, a cautious manner, and get businesses up and running again, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.Mims Davies, the minister for employment, said: “We know that people are worried about their livelihoods which is why we\u0027ve put in place a Plan For Jobs.”A crucial part of that is doubling the number of frontline work coaches so that every jobseeker gets support to find work as well as launching the Kickstart scheme to create hundreds of thousands of new, fully subsidised jobs for young people across the country.“Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley says he is “upset, annoyed and baffled” by the decision to replace him as the broadcaster’s senior football commentator.The channel announced on Tuesday that Sam Matterface will step up to replace Tyldesley as their chief commentator, and that although the veteran broadcaster would remain a part of their football plans, he would no longer be the first choice for their England games and coverage of World Cup and European Championship fixtures.The 65-year-old first worked with ITV early in his broadcast career before switching to the BBC in the early 1990s, but retired in 1996 before going on to become their main voice on football, having covered some of the defining European and international moments in the sport’s recent history.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut having first been told of the decision three weeks ago, Tydlesley addressed the decision for the first time in an emotional video on social media, in which he said that he has struggled to understand the reasons for the decision given that he has not been told any.“If you haven’t seen the announcement I am being replaced as ITV’s senior football commentator,” Tyldesley said in a video posted to his Twitter page.Clive Tyldesley replaced as ITV’s chief commentator after 22 yearsTyldesley calls for commentary training after study finds racial biasClive Tyldesley on racism, Twitter vultures and finding the right word“Quite a few people have been in touch with me asking me to react, to comment. I’m not sure that would be a very good idea at the moment.“I was told about three weeks ago so I have had some time to get my head around the decision, but I haven’t got my head around it. To be clear, this is ITV’s decision, not mine, and I’m upset, annoyed, baffled.”The announcement came three days after what should have been the Euro 2020 final, which Tyldesley would almost certainly have commentated on, and he confirmed that there are no plans for retirement or complications with ill health on his side that have have played a factor in the move.“I would have been interested with commentating the Euro 2020 final for them less than 48 horus ago but now I won’t be commentating on any of the big England games in the coming year and I’m going to miss them. I love this job, and it’s gone,” he added.“Why? I don’t know. I do not know exactly why this decision has been taken. Already I’ve had the producer of a broadcaster that I am working on asking me if I have got any health issues. No, I have got no health issues. Asking me if it is something that I have done. No, there’s nothing.“I gather that one or two sites are reporting that I’ve been sacked, well I guess I have from one job but I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m the same broadcaster, the same person that I’ve always been. Like me or hate me and you’re entitled to do either. Like everybody else in football I am a matter of opinion and I totally get that, and I totally respect ITV’s right to change their opinion of me. ITV have been really good for me and yes I’ll carry on as their No 2 commentator.“But let me make it quite clear: I have not stepped down. I have been moved, moved aside. I’ve not even thought about winding down towards retirement or anything like that.”ITV have not given their reasons for demoting Tyldesley for Matterface, with director of ITV Sport Niall Sloane only saying “on behalf of ITV Sport, I would like to thank Clive for his superb work leading our commentary on some of the biggest occasions in world football throughout his outstanding career with us.”Sloane added that ITV are “very glad he will continue with is and look forward to working with him on many more occasions in the future”, but while Tyldesley was keen to stress that he remains in a privileged position given the number of people currently without employment, the pain of losing his his role hurts nonetheless.“Now listen, there are thousands of people in this country facing up to job losses and disappointment that is far more serious than this,” he said. “I am a lucky boy, I love my work and I’ve got plenty on, so I’m not making a statement or anything like that.

The anomalous figures from South America may be due to the pandemic\u0027s effect on already volatile economies, according to Invezz’s David Merry.“The impact that Covid-19 has had on the industry is huge, the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.Many countries such as Russia and China are down as much as half when compared to last year. However, Covid-19 has also further exacerbated existing geopolitical issues within South America, and this may well have caused an interesting spike in bitcoin trading activity.This trend is only further likely to continue, with many Latin American countries such as Venezuela, now adopting cryptocurrency to help alleviate the issues of hyperinflation.Venezuela actually saw a slight drop in bitcoin trading, however its already high volumes means it is now second only to Russia in terms of trading volume.The country\u0027s economy has been in free-fall for several years, made worse by crippling economic sanctions imposed by the UK and US.Bitcoin overtakes gold to become the best performing asset of 2020Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate hit 10 million per cent in 2019, prompting many people to turn to cryptocurrencies as a more stable medium of exchange.Since 1 June, 2020, an estimated 20,000 shops and businesses in the country now accept payments via bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, has admitted the UK has not had a good outcome from the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking to MPs on the Commons science and technology committee Sir Patrick said: “It’s clear the outcome in the UK has not been good. I think we can be absolutely clear about that.”He had previously said 20,000 deaths would be a “good result” in the pandemic, but the latest death rates show the UK has seen more than 50,000 deaths linked to coronavirus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir Patrick, chair of the government\u0027s scientific advisory committee, SAGE, also told MPs that the lack of data and flows of information could have been better and that was an important lesson, not just for pandemics but any emergency.Asked for his reflections on the management of the outbreak Sir Patrick also questioned the structure and the way that SAGE operates. It\u0027s never been set up to work for 47 meetings, he said.We\u0027re meeting twice a week for most of this, and we need to think about how to make that work. It\u0027s largely volunteer academics who\u0027ve helped out. They\u0027ve gone over and above to put their advice into the system and to help in all sorts of ways, I think we need to think about the resilience of that system.A third area he said was the presence of science knowledge across government departments stressing SAGE was only an advisory body.He said: The science system across government and across agencies needs to be robust. Sage is not the science system, it is a science advisory body. Science within Public Health England needs to be in the right place, science in departments needs to be in the right place. There needs to be enough in order to be able to take the science advice.Sir Patrick defended SAGE in relation to care homes telling MPs the issues in care homes were mentioned as early as February in SAGE minutes and many times since.He said SAGE did not have policymakers in its grasp and that it did not make decisions on operational issues.On the threat of the virus to children Sir Patrick said severe disease was extremely rare in children and that they may be infected less by the virus.He added: If you look at countries that have re-opened schools, they are seldom the cause of the outbreak.Science and Technology Committee\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers are said to believe they have made a breakthrough after discovering the jab could provide “double protection” against the virus. Leicester’s mayor has urged the government to lift the local lockdown in 90 per cent of the city, warning a further two-week extension would leave residents “very angry indeed”.

In the world the epidemic is in its hardest phase.

Speaking about the book, which will be published by HarperCollins on 15 October, Morgan said: “The biggest threat to our freedom in the 21st century isn’t coronavirus but hysterically woke liberals trying to kill democracy by suppressing free speech.“This is my clarion call, as a liberal myself, for them to stop screaming, shaming and cancelling everyone they disagree with, and start being part of the solution to global disharmony and ision – not the problem.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe presenter and journalist is known for his antipathy to “woke liberals”. In January, he tweeted: “’Woke’ means being constantly, self-righteously certain that your ultra-liberal, virtue-signalling opinion is not only always right but anyone who disagrees is an idiot. You know the type...”During a 2019 interview with American commentator Ben Shapiro, Morgan said: “This snowflake culture that we now operate in, the victimhood culture, the everyone has to think in a certain way, behave a certain way...

This can reach temperatures of more than a million degrees Celsius.This is 300 times greater than the surface of the star, which is a comparatively chilly 5500 degrees Celsius.Despite decades of study, the mechanisms that heat this outermost layer are still not fully understood, but such discoveries are vital in the study of solar physics.It’s possible these nanoflares could be the key to unlocking this mystery.NASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decade“It’s obviously way too early to tell but we hope that by connecting these observations with measurements from our other instruments that ‘feel’ the solar wind as it passes the spacecraft, we will eventually be able to answer some of these mysteries,” Yannis Zouganelis, Solar Orbiter Deputy Project Scientist at ESA, said in a statement.“We are all really excited about these first images – but this is just the beginning,” adds Daniel Müller, ESA’s Solar Orbiter Project Scientist.“Solar Orbiter has started a grand tour of the inner Solar System, and will get much closer to the Sun within less than two years. Ultimately, it will get as close as 42 million km, which is almost a quarter of the distance from Sun to Earth.”The temperatures of these campfires will be tracked using a tool called the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE), which takes images using ultraviolet light.“Spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the diagnostic of fundamental processes in hot plasmas. Each spectral line gives us a piece of the puzzle – combining information from all lines reveals the amazing complexity of the atmosphere,” said Dr Andrzej Fludra, the SPICE Instrument Consortium lead.The Solar Orbiter has ten sensors: six which monitor the Sun and its surroundings, and four to monitor the environment around the ship itself.This includes the Orbiter’s Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA), which measures heavy charged atoms of carbon, oxygen, silicon, and iron in the solar winds from the Sun’s inner heliosphere. By comparing the data between the sensors, scientists will also be able to better understand how solar winds are generated. Solar winds are charged particles sent from the Sun which can affect the entire solar system.“Already our data are revealing shockwaves, coronal mass ejections, phenomena called ‘switchbacks’ and fine-scale waves in the magnetic field that we are only able to see thanks to the extreme sensitivity of our instrument” said Professor Tim Horbury from Imperial College London.Nasa delays trip to Mars after rocket problemNASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decadeNasa asks for ideas for toilets for astronauts to use on the MoonNasa plans to fly a helicopter on MarsOn occasion, the Sun pushes out a great number of particles into space. These are called “coronal mass ejections” and, when they hit the Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause a huge surge of electrical current.On Earth, these events can disrupt and damage satellites, affecting people’s mobile phones, GPS signals, and electricity networks.The largest one to hit the Earth happened in 1859 and caused telegraph wires to alight. If the same event happened today, it could potentially cause continent-wide blackouts and severely damage the electrical grid.Such damage could take months or years to repair, at a cost of up to £300 billion to the UK economy.The Solar Orbiter itself was part of a combined effort from Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, as well as Nasa from the United States.It was built by Airbus Defence and Space in the UK, and launched from Nasa’s Cape Canaveral site in Florida on 10 February.The Solar Orbiter will eventually get closer to the Sun than the planet Mercury, the closest planet in the solar system to the SunGravitational forces from Venus and Earth will be used to direct the craft. By November 2021, it is expected to be in operational orbit.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For a town already caught in a slow and painful state of decline, the coronavirus pandemic has brought Blackburn to its knees. Decades of de-industrialisation and growing economic deprivation have left the area struggling to find its purpose – while larger, more prosperous neighbours have reinvented themselves – but the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 could prove to be the final straw.“We’ve been here for 32 long years,” said Maria Elder, the owner of Sudell Sandwiches, a small cafe in the town centre. “Lots of loyal customers over the years. We’d serve students from the college too. We even had a contract with the police to feed the officers when the football was on. That’s all gone, for now at least. We’re barely coping.”The worry for Ms Elder and other independent businesses is what a second lockdown would mean for the town. After a recent surge in cases Blackburn finds itself walking a dangerous line. The region’s seven-day rate currently stands at 47 infections per 100,000 people and is expected to rise in the coming days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAuthorities have already tightened restrictions this week, urging residents to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings, but the plunge back into full lockdown would likely drive many companies to the point of no return.“I think it’d shut us down,” said Ms Elder. “People are extremely scared and worried, because there’s a lot of places that only opened on Monday – beauticians, hairdressers. And it’s still very quiet.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“We’ve been here a long time, we’re an established business, but it has seriously impacted us, it really has. I’ve had to lay off one girl as a result.”Asad Jalil, who has run a dry cleaning shop in the town centre since 1989, said a second lockdown would push his business “over the edge”.“If there’s another lockdown for two or three weeks, it’s going to make it worse. People are already scared. There’s not enough money for going out, buying new stuff, people are making do with what they’ve got. “I can’t see my business returning. I doubt I’ll be here next year. Many of my usual customers are at home, working in their pyjamas. They don’t need to go into the office anymore. They don’t need to get their suits cleaned. I only came back yesterday but I don’t think it’s going to pick up again.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although trade has been good for Anna Green and Emily Yates since they reopened their salon earlier this month, they are one of the few to have come through this period of turbulence.“In this building alone, there’s one room empty next door and upstairs there’s six empty,” Ms Green said. “They’ve had to fold. It’s not the most affluent of areas. A lot of people have packed up and gone.”The pandemic has only added to Blackburn\u0027s problems. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly one-third since 2010, losing out on tens of millions of pounds, while the region has one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the country.Some buildings in the town centre have stood empty for 10 years or more. Unwilling to take a risk on Blackburn and its struggling economy, business has been turning elsewhere in the northwest.“Blackburn was a booming town,” said Mr Jalil, the dry cleaner owner. “People used to flock here from all around, but now they don’t even bother. They either go into Bolton or Preston. There’s no footfall in Blackburn anymore.”Deprivation is also a serious and growing issue. Last year, the charity End Child Poverty revealed that half of all children in Blackburn lived in poverty, with this rate up to two-thirds in the ward of Bastwell.Nonetheless, stoicism is much in evidence. Residents are aware that everyone has a role to play in getting through the pandemic.Blackburn holds its breath after recent spike in Covid-19 cases“Everyone is putting on face masks, all our customers are taking it on board,” said Marcus Gannon, director of Hobkirk sewing machines, which can trace its history in the town back to 1903. “No one has got anything against it. They all appreciate it. And in a way, it gives customers who want to come in here the confidence to do so. People are just getting on with it.”Ms Elder, the cafe owner, echoed these sentiments, saying that “the majority of people are now wearing masks” and abiding by the rules – at least in public. “Everyone is taking it seriously,” she said. “I think the new restrictions are a good thing but we’ll have to see how it goes.”The council has also been working hard with small businesses to ensure they can operate under the current system. “I know some of our officers have been out and helped put the new guidance in place,” said Saima Afzal, a councillor. “Everyone has been really proactive. I think we’ve got a really resilient community in Blackburn so they are carrying on.”“My company has been here for 100 odd years,” said Mr Gannon. “I want it to be here another 100 years. We can’t give in.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on the health of the nation’s relationships, according to research which suggests bonds between couples, friends and colleagues have all been strained by the UK’s lockdown.One-fifth of people feel friendships with others outside of their household suffered in the last four months as social distancing kept people apart, UCL’s Covid-19 social study found.But the lockdown seems also to have impacted on those who live together, with 20 per cent of respondents saying friendships with their housemates were now worse. Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Labour has accused the government of handing out lucrative Covid-19 contracts to Conservative friends and warned that equipment has not been delivered.Ministers were urged to explain how deals worth “more than £830m have been awarded to at least 12 different companies” for personal protective equipment (PPE) – which has “never materialised”.In the Commons, Labour also demanded answers over a contract handed – “without any public tender process” – to Public First, a company run by a former aide to Michael Gove and associate of Dominic Cummings.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt was “owned by friends of the prime minister’s most senior adviser”, Helen Hayes, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said – and “justified as part of the coronavirus response but appears to relate to Brexit”.“The flexibility required by extraordinary circumstances is no excuse for reducing transparency or abandoning any attempt at due diligence,” Ms Hayes protested.PM\u0027s \u0027incompetence\u0027 to blame for intelligence committee humiliationPenny Mordaunt, a Cabinet Office minister, did not deny that PPE had not been delivered, but insisted every MP knew a senior employee at Public First – who was a “former much-loved deputy speaker” of the Commons.“If the honourable lady has serious concerns about these contracts, other than insinuations, there are very clear process to go through, and I would urge her to do so,” she said.The row comes as the government faces a court case over the awarding of emergency contracts, outside of normal rules, alleging breaches of procurement law and apparent bias to longstanding associates.It has been launched by the Good Law Project, which instigated important legal, and is crowdfunding for resources.Created with Sketch.Care home hit by coronavirus: A rare glimpse of life inside Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeControversy surrounds a £32m contract handed to a pest control company called PestFix to source surgical gowns, although it has listed net assets of only £18,000.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.The team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Early estimates showed there were 1.9 per cent less people on employers\u0027 payrolls in June compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said. Unemployment fell 17,000 between March and May to 1.35 million, leaving the official rate unchanged at 3.9 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, experts warned that the jobs figures masked the true scale of the crisis. The number of hours worked dropped at the fastest pace on record, suggesting that the headline unemployment is an underestimate.Average weekly hours worked per person fell to a record low of 26.6 between March and May, down by 5.5 hours on the same period a year ago. Weekly data show that hours worked began to recover in May, with self-employed people seeing a significant rise in work.Can we trust the predictions for Britain’s economy?Job vacancies fell to 333,000 between April and June - almost two-thirds lower than in the same period last year and the lowest level since the ONS began collecting comparable data in 2001.The claimant count, which includes people on universal credit or jobseeker\u0027s allowance, more than doubled between March and May to 1.4 million, before levelling off in June.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said: As the pandemic took hold, the labour market weakened markedly, but that rate of decline slowed into June, though this is before recent reports of job losses.There are now almost two-thirds of a million fewer employees on the payroll than before the lockdown, according to the latest tax data.The Labour Force Survey is showing only a small fall in employment, but shows a large number of people who report working no hours and getting no pay.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The number of people temporarily away from work dropped from a peak of  8.8 million in April to 6.3 million by the end of May.That figure is likely to have continued to rise as non-essential retailers, pubs and restaurants - all big employers - began to re-open in June.However, almost a third of businesses plan to cut staff in the next three months, according to a survey this week by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) found.Government plans to slow the expected surge in joblessness have attracted criticism, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies labelling them badly timed and poorly targeted.Last week Rishi Sunak announced subsidies for restaurant meals, a VAT cut for hospitality firms and a £1,000 bonus for each furloughed employee brought back into work and kept on until January.The chancellor conceded on Wednesday that much of the furlough bonus was dead weight, meaning it would be wasted on paying employers for workers they had intended to keep on anyway.John Phillips, GMB acting general secretary, said: “Without further Government action, the risk is the cuts to jobs and wages so far will just be the tip of an iceberg that crushes livelihoods and crashes our economy.  “The response from this recession cannot be like the last if we are to recover.  “This country cannot endure another decade of weak growth and cuts to services - we need a Government prepared to make bold investment in jobs, skills and industries.“Business Secretary Alok Sharma said many people are facing a very, very difficult time, following the publication of the latest unemployment figures.I think the best thing we can do is continue to open up the economy in a phased manner, a cautious manner, and get businesses up and running again, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.Mims Davies, the minister for employment, said: “We know that people are worried about their livelihoods which is why we\u0027ve put in place a Plan For Jobs.”A crucial part of that is doubling the number of frontline work coaches so that every jobseeker gets support to find work as well as launching the Kickstart scheme to create hundreds of thousands of new, fully subsidised jobs for young people across the country.“Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You are a clever girl, Sue.”It’s a little bit patronising, admittedly and he’d be hauled through every kangaroo court in the country for saying that out loud now.But I’ll take Jim’s innocent version of television before I take ’s joyless, humourless woke wasteland all day long, thanks very much. It’s a happier place.INCIDENTALLY, Loose Women, Janet Street- Porter: “If I was an animal I’d be a terrapin.”What’s technically known as horse-s***.MEANWHILE, on episode three of Celebrity Snoop Dogs, a pug called Colin is snfing around a weight-training room as Channel ’s Kevin McCloud builds to the big reveal.“More eye-catching, though, is that plaque behind the microphone. Could it belong to ­someone who’s good at making people laugh “It’s Russell Kane!” No, it couldn’t.HOW television works .Someone a BBC continuity announcer described as “the wonderful Maxine Peake” starred in last week’s Talking Heads, a fortnight after sharing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about George Floyd’s death, with The Independent.Miriam Margolyes s to the Beeb shortly, with her Almost Australian travelogue, despite telling Channel ’s Last Leg she wanted the Prime Minister to die of coronavirus.But actor Laurence Fox is unemployable and considered a public pariah, by the industry, because he told Question Time that Britain was “the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe”.One rule for one, quite another for Corbynistas.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Asteroid  Audrey is named after which actress ”Marina: “Kim Basinger.”Tenable, Warwick Davis: “Name the ten largest countries in South America.” Devon: “Hungary.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  -year-old Judit Polgar became the youngest ­international grandmaster of which board game ”Helena: “Monopoly.”Ben Shephard: “Mayo is the Spanish word for which month of the year ”Rick: “March.”GOOD Morning Britain, Monday, Piers: “What about this  At my local Italian ­restaurant, on Saturday, after all this showing-each- other-more-kindness talk, there were  no-shows.”Then Piers turned up. Problem solved. So what about it HAVING failed to conquer Hollywood or overthrow international capitalism Russell Brand took on a slightly more manageable project, last week.A cameo in Neighbours where he literally bumped into Toadie, eating a muffin, at the Harold Bishop cafe.“You’re Russell Brand! What are you doing here in Erinsborough ”“Well, you know,” said Brand, “Get Him To The Greek, The Trews, socialism, Ed Miliband. It all went horribly wrong.“So it was either this or a Postcode Lottery advert, with Jeff Brazier.”Actually, he said no such thing.He made a funny, self-mocking speech about the irony of mobile phones being “emblems of interconnectivity, yet we’re more atomised, adrt and lost than ever before”, then went to order a coffee.And I’ve got no hesitation in saying, I think it’s his finest ever work.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has no place anywhere. It is often a breach of human rights. It is often illegal.So it is understandable that many of us are questioning why this is happening – and, by extension, what our role is in this.Has our desire for cheap and cheerful fashion created this sickening practice  Are we somehow to blame for insisting we will only pay as little as possible for everything Should we — as some smarmy “influencers” suggest — be boycotting anyone who sells cheap clothes The simple answer is: NoOf course, in an ideal world, we’d all be buying top quality, ethically sourced garments that last a letime.But that’s just not going to happen. Most people just can’t afford to. And we like to keep up with trends while at the same time paying the bills. There is nothing wrong with that.Our love of fashion keeps the economy going.Fashion is the UK’s largest creative industry. It provides jobs for almost as many people as the financial sector and is one of the most female-dominated industries in the world.Around , people work in the UK fashion industry and approximately  per cent of garment workers are women.Livelihoods are at stakewe decide to boycott fashion brands because of their bad practices.The answer is for fast fashion firms like Boohoo and Quiz to do the work and get their houses in order. This is on them.And big firms like Boohoo — a business worth £.billion — are not without means. They have the resources to make changes.They need to perform due diligence on who is making their clothes — they must forensically examine the whole supply chain, from contractors to sub-contractors and anyone  who has a hand in how this stuff comes to market.Decent wages must be the norm. They must be transparent and tell us, the consumer, what they know.This is not rocket science. It is already happening.The Fashion Transparency Index  ranks  of the biggest global fashion brands according to how much information they provide about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices and social and environmental impact.Retailers are scored on their transparency across five key areas: Policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues.HM, one of the largest fashion retailers in the world, is currently top of The Fashion Transparency Index.Stung by allegations that its clothes had been made by child labour in Myanmar — with some paid as little as p an hour — it last year built a new tracking system so consumers can find out where each garment is made.Marks  Spencer also scored highly. It introduced an ethical trading programme including audits of its supply chain in the Nineties.Eleven more brands in the Fashion Index revealed details of their processing facilities — where finishing, dyeing and laundering take place — in  compared to .And ten brands disclosed their raw material suppliers in , compared with just one in .Of course this isn’t just a fast fashion problem. It is industry-wide.What customers need from all brands is transparency, as this leads to accountability and ultimately change.Soyou do want to spend your hard-earned cash on fast fashion, only shop at places where you know they are doing their bit to ensure things are more ethically sourced.AS much as I love new clothes, fast fashion has had its day.Two brands have recently been at the centre of allegations that garments are being made or packed in dire working conditions in Leicester.Boohoo has paid a heavy price for these claims, with more than a billion pounds wiped off the value of its shares.Today, it suffered another big fall after a leading investor sold out on ethical grounds.And rival Quiz was sucked into the growing storm. It has suspended a supplier after claims that a factory in Leicester offered a worker just £ an hour to make its clothes.Quiz admitted that the situation, which it is investigating, is “unacceptable”.As online retailers specialising in casualwear, these companies were riding high after lockdown boosted sales. Following these allegations, the tide is turning against them.It comes after lockdown prompted many of us to reassess our lives, with the desire to be greener high on the agenda.A recent survey showed that more women were willing to make do and mend. That can’t be a bad thing.A common reason that clothes are sent to landfill is a missing button, which is simply appalling.Before buying a new dress or jacket, I now ask myself, ‘Am I going to wear this item for years ’Fashion is a global industry worth more than £trillion a year. It will clean itself up where necessary and adapt.Boohoo and Quiz have been swt to terminate relationships with rogue suppliers. Elsewhere, there is much talk of “respons-ible” and “sustainable” fashion.Don’t be surprisedthe fast fashion pack gives itself a long overdue makeover. Hopefully it will be more than the latest fad.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scotland’s government has had to be propped up every step of the way by Westminster.Sturgeon is a good TV performer, I’ll give her that.She’s adored by the international media in the same way New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern is. But the facts on the ground do not match the rhetoric.Anda right-wing politician was suggesting the introduction of a border blocking free movement by citizens of the UK we would never hear the end of it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, whatever the cost becomes, it is less than the cost of the threat to our national security and is a price we must pay. We were warned repeatedly by all of our allies about involving Huawei in our communications network.In recent years, I have heard first-hand from each of our intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called “Five Eyes” network . All of these countries, our closest allies, have been deeply worried by Britain’s decision. All have warned that this country — and our relationships with our allies — would be compromisedwe allowed Huawei such access. We would have been vulnerable, they warned.Bizarrely, Theresa May ignored this advice, then Boris Johnson’s government originally went further down this terrible road.This, despite the fact that other companies — including US firms — could have provided just the same technology, without the same security risks.And, key sources tell me, all for the same price. Still the Government snubbed our allies, alarmed our friends, and stuck to their decision.Privately it was briefed out that our own security services were confident of their ability to get backdoor access to see what Huawei would be doing and to control any covert activity. But all of this seemed a ridiculously high-risk venture. And for what exactly  Fortunately, that bizarre decision got reversed yesterday.Several factors have contributed to it. The first is an obvious change in relations towards China that is going on around the world. Covid- has played a part. China — unwittingly or carelessly — gave the world a virus which has all but halted our economies.The CCP’s lies and cover-ups during this devastating period have meant that all of us have been confined to our houses for months — and not just those who have contracted the coronavirus that came from Wuhan.In the months and years ahead, all of us will be poorer because of the CCP’s lies. The state has disappeared its own scientists. It allowed travel even after it knew what it was dealing with. It lied about the nature of the virus.And other members of the Five Eyes network have suggested that the evidence points clearly to the virus having been created in a Chinese laboratory.President Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have rightly made an issue of this. Both have been warning for years about the instability of China as a partner. As recent events in Hong Kong should remind us, China is a one-party, totalitarian state. It rules by dictatorship and terror. Of course, it is also highly technologically skilled and financially ever more dominant.The CCP seeks to make China the world’s leading power. Washington is — rightly — determined to stop that. And this country —we value freedom and the rule of law, as we always have — should seek to stop that too.This means, among much , denying China and Chinese state companies from extending their grip in countries like ours.For years, Chinese companies have stolen information, ripped off s, and otherwise acted completely unlawfully. They have engaged in espionage and information theft on an industrial scale.Some people might look at yesterday’s decision and think it a small, technical matter. It isn’t.Not only is it a decision with far-reaching consequences for this country’s security. It is also a signal of which side this country will be on in one of the most important tussles of our day.Everywhere China seeks to extend its power is an area where freedom recedes.Yesterday was a bad day for Huawei, a good day for Britain and a great day for freedom.Q: WHAT is the new ruling on Huawei A: From the end of this year, telecoms firms will not be able to buy any new Huawei hardware, such as antennas, to put into their G networks. By the end of , all Huawei equipment must be stripped out of the UK’s G networks.Q: Why is G important A: It will be ten times faster than G and allow more complicated technology, such as driverless cars, to operate.Q: What is Huawei currently used for A: The firm is the leading provider of technology needed to operate wireless networks that provide the G signal on our mobile phones. They were going to be used for “non-core” equipment in the G network. Instead European firms Nokia or Erion are likely to provide the hardware.Q: Can I still use my Huawei mobile phone A: Yes. There is no plan to ban its handsets.Q: Will the ban affect my phone signal A: Some telecom firms have warned that stripping out all Huawei hardware too quickly could result in a temporary loss of signal in some places, but other experts say this concern has been exaggerated.Q: Does this affect full fibre broadband connections A: Not at the moment. The Government’s security advisers have only recommended “transitioning away” from Huawei when it comes to fibre networks.Q: Will I have to replace a Huawei router in my home A: The router is not part of the G infrastructure and won’t be affected.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some , households had their benefits cut by the cruel policy in the three years since it launched in . Overall those households contain , children. More than half the householdsare in work - and % of them are single parents, annual official statistics show today. The damning figures come after years of pleas by MPs, charities and academics to axe the austerity cut. Launched by ex-Chancellor George Osborne, the limit bars parents from claiming Child Tax Credits or Universal Credit for third or subsequent children born after  April .Ministers had planned to extend the cut, worth up to £, per child, to children born before  as well but decided not to after an outcry. Despite the climbdown, todayaposs figures show the vast scale of the policy in only three years. There are exemptions for some children, such as adopted kids or those born of rape. But this rape clause prompted fury among campaigners - as women affected must declare their attack in a submission to the DWP. The new figures show the aposrape clauseapos was invoked  times in the first three years of the policy. SNP MP Alison Thewliss, who has campaigned against the aposrape clauseapos, said the figures were devastating.  She added: Approaching one million children are now suffering financial hardship, the majority of them in families where their parents are working. “This is a horric legacy for any government. It’s time for Boris Johnson to wake up to this reality, signal a change of direction on welfare and scrap this pernicious Tory policy. “Most shocking of all,  women have been forced to go through the process of claiming for an exception due to a non-consensual conception. Every single one of these women has been put in a position where they’ve had to fill in a form to prove their child was conceived as a result of rape or coercion, just to make ends meet. Labouraposs Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: These figures show just how many families the two child limit is pushing into further hardship at a dficult time. No-one could have been expected to foresee a crisis like Covid- when making decisions about the size of their family. Itaposs unfair to punish them for that now. The two child limit is effectively an -year sanction on those decisions and is a major driver of child poverty.

Errol Grahamaposs daughter-in-law has been granted a two-day judicial review hearing to argue the governmentaposs protection for vulnerable benefit claimants was unlawful. In an important test case, Alison Turner will also ask judges to declare the Work and Pensions Secretary, Therese Coffey, breached the law by failing to properly review its policies after Errolaposs death. If she wins the judicial review, it could have profound implications for the future of Department for Work and Pensions benefit policy for the most vulnerable. A DWP spokesman said: “It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time.” Errol Graham weighed less than five stone when bailfs found his body in June  - eight months after his ESA disabled benefit was stopped for missing an appointment. The -year-old, who had severe mental health dficulties, had just a couple of five-year-old tins of fish in his cupboard. Mr Grahamaposs death was referred to a Serious Case Panel. But its membership is secret and the DWP has refused to sayMs Turner will be allowed to see the findings. Ms Turner said in a statement: “Errol had a long history of serious mental illness which left him severely incapacitated. When the circumstances of his death came to light we had hoped and from what the DWP stated at the inquest, we had expected that the department would review their safeguarding policies and involve us in that review. “But, incredibly, that has not happened.We deserve answers and those answers need to be public for the sake of other families - and other vulnerable benefits claimants who suffer similar mental health dficulties. “No one  should be put at risk in the same way Errol was because adequate safeguarding measures are not in place.” Mr Grahamaposs death sparked fresh calls for an independent inquiry into benefit claimantsapos deaths. The spiral towards losing his benefits began on  August , when he failed to attend a fit-for-work test for his ESA.

We should also move as quickly as possible. The PM said that the case for both Houses staying in place should be considered but that other locations should be in the mix. He stated: However, the review should also consider a possible location outside London. The Government is considering establishing a Government hub in York and it would therefore make sense to consider this as a potential location. The comments came after a new consultation process was launched last month which considered whether MPs and peers would need to vacate the historic building as work is carried out. In the letter to people involved in the review, the PM said: We should also move as quickly as possible, both because of the risks associated with the current state of the building and the need to provide certainty on the way forward and thereby minimise disruption to our business. Before Parliament voted in  to approve the renewal works, which will entail decanting the whole building for at least six years, MPs had pushed rival plans that would have seen only a partial vacating required. This would have forced builders to work around the Commons schedule.The idea has since gained traction again following the coronavirus outbreak.A recent report by the National Audit Officestated that the £ billion cost previously reported for the project was likely to be a median figure, with the final outlay on the Unesco World Heritage Site expected to be higher. Initial estimates put the final bill as high as £ billion, with the builders expected to be in until the s. The body said that a team will assess whether a recommendation made in a report four years ago that all MPs and Lords should leave the Palace of Westminster while the work was carried out is still the best and most cost-effective option.

Bradley Green, , had got aposhammeredapos with pals after blagging free drinks throughout the night at a club. But when he and his friends all woke with hangovers, Bradleyaposs mate, who only wants to be called Lee, couldnapost manage to get to his first-year seminar at University of Nottingham. So Bradley, then a music production student, donned his mateaposs clothes and sneaked past security to attend the law lecture. Bradley, who has just graduated from Leeds Beckett University more than  miles away, said: I met my mates back in Nottingham, my hometown, during some time off. I took them to a club in Nottingham where staff know me so we were given free drinks the whole night. We were absolutely hammering the drink. We got very, very drunk. I was convincing my mates to stay out but Lee said aposI have uni tomorrow. I canapost.apos But I said aposforget uni, bro. Iaposll just got for you. I do it all the time at my uni.apos So I did. We slept at his and then I borrowed clothes and went to the lecture as him. Bradley, who is now a music producer and nightclub promoter, managed to get past security back in February and found the lecture theatre.The urban artist, from Nottingham and who uses Instagram handle SundayMidweekOfficial, added: I looked like I fitted in as I had my hood up and head down. I was making funny comments though to people next to me.I know nothing about law. I have been watching Suits recently so am interested but I got there, the guy was telling stories about law and I didnapost know much about it. Iaposm also dyslexic so taking notes just wasnapost an option really. It was so dferent to my university.  But the graduate, hungover himself after downing  Jägermeister shots and other booze, said he enjoyed the experience. He added: You just have to push through the hangover. It was a good laugh. I liked seeing how dferent the unis were. Where my mate was staying, they were selling fruit and vegetables actually in the halls.  I didnapost eat any fruit and vegetables during my whole time at uni so it was so dferent. At the uni, they were selling gourmet burgers and pizzas in the cafeteria. At my uni, we basically just had a fake KFC.

The -year-old, who is part of Britain’s biggest family the Radfords, is expecting her first baby who she is calling Ophelia in September.Sharing the adorable picture on Instagram, Millie wrote: “ weeks until we get to meet Baby I can’t wait to meet you.”Excited grandma-to-be Sue Radford replied saying: “Counting down the weeks till we get to hold you Ophelia we love you so much already.” Millie is preparing for her daughteraposs arrival with a stunning nursery decorated in animal prints, adorable personalised blankets and a stylish white crib where Ophelia will sleep. Generous super-mum Sue reduced the teen to tears when she treated her to a haul of baby items including a brand new pram. But with restrictions in place due the lockdown, Millieaposs pregnancy hasn’t been what she expected. Sharing a pic of her baby bump at  weeks she confessed: “I’m gutted I haven’t had the chance to enjoy this pregnancy like I wanted to because of lockdown. No baby shopping, no listening to babyaposs heartbeat, no sharing this experience with my friends or family.  When Millie announced she was expecting she said she as worried as Sue was  week pregnant with her nd birthday with husband Noel. She said: “My parents have always seen me as the ‘good girl’. They are not strict but I knew that telling them would make it real. “Thankfully, they weren’t disappointed. They were excited.” Sue went on to give birth to Heidie in April which means the tot will become an auntie at the young age of just five months when Ophelia arrives.  Heidie joins her siblings Chris, , Sophie, , Chloe, , Jack, , Daniel, , Luke, , Katie, , James, , Ellie, , Aimee, , Josh, , Max, , Tillie, nine, Oscar, eight, Casper, seven, Hallie, four, Phoebe, three, Archie, two, Bonnie, one and Millie.

The Cambridge kids looked adorable in their little outfits as they were ushered into the church by their mum the Duchess of Cambridge. Unlike Kateaposs wedding to Prince William, the celebration was a private affair but well-wishers and members of the press were outside the church to see Pippa and her husband-to-be James Matthews arrive. While most people loved the excitement of the almost-royal wedding, the big day was a bit too much for some of the younger guests and little George got a tad upset. The Queenaposs great-grandson, usually the master of the polite smile and wave, broke down in tears after the ceremony at St Markaposs Church in Englefield, Berkshire, in . The poor little prince had already had enough as he left the church and was pictured pulling a face as he led the rest of the children scattering confetti in front of Pippa and her new husband. As they made their way over to the cars waiting to whisk them off to the reception, Kate turned to her son and gave him a stern telling off. It included the famous aposthataposs enough nowapos finger point, a universal hand gesture recognised by stressed mothers everywhere, and left George in tears.  According to the Daily Mail, he was in trouble after Kate spotted him purposely stepping on the train of Pippaaposs white lace Giles Deacon wedding dress. The little prince spotted Charlotte doing it, so decided to have a go himself. Oh dear... And the prince wasnapost the only page boy acting up, as one appeared to stick out his tongue and pull a dubious finger gesture - right under Kateaposs nose.  The bridesmaids on the big day were Countess Philippa Hoyos, Lily French, Avia Horner and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, with Casimir Tatos, Edward Sebire, William Ward and Prince George acting as page boys. But allaposs well that ends well, as the young Prince soon appeared to forget his tantrum, and resume smiling sweetly and waving to the media as the cars drove the wedding party to the reception at the Middletonsapos family home. To the princeaposs credit, he played his role perfectly as he arrived at the ceremony, looking angelic as he prepared to walk down the aisle. Adorably dressed in a white shirt, green trousers and long white socks, big brother George even appeared to help his sister Charlotte carry her flower arrangement. But just before the ceremony got started, the Duchess was spotted shushing the children as they got a little too caught up in the buzz of the day. While this upset was short and sweet, itaposs not the first time heaposs had a wobble in public. Back in , he almost lost his cool at his sisteraposs christening, before a quick pep talk from his dad perked him right back up again. After the ceremony, the newly married couple took a short drive to Pippaaposs parentsapos home in the nearby village of Bucklebury, where staff were waiting to dispense champagne and canapes to the happy revellers. The evening do at the marquee at the Middleton family home was for adults only, with a five-course meal, drinks and dancing until the small hours.  Guests included royals Kate, William, Harry and Princess Beatrice, plus celebs including Made in Cha star Spencer Matthews - the groomaposs brother - and tennis ace Roger Federer.Keen not to steal the show from her younger sister, the Duchess wore an understated but very elegant outfit by Alexander McQueen, who designed her wedding dress back in ."},{"url":null,"title":"single mum left sleeping floor","story":"NewsSingle mum left sleeping on floor after paying £ for broken bed on FacebookSophie Adamson said she bought the bed from a page on Facebook, but after collecting it, she found it all broken when she tried to put it up and the page has since blocked herShareCommentsByNathan StandleyJamie Hawkins:,  JUL NewsSophie said the £ bed was badly damaged when she collected it \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Parts of the UK should see more regular highs of C throughout end of July, according to the latest long-range weather maps.UK forecasts show the country will see some balmy temperatures towards the end of the month, with highs of C possible in some areas, reports the Express. It comes after a wet start to July following the hottest day of the year during the June  heatwave when temperatures hit .C at Heathrow in London. On Sunday the temperatures are expected to dip slightly, and WXCHARTS weather maps indicate the start of next week will not be quite so hot. But later in July things get better as the mercury is forecast to rise once again, with many parts of the country expected to see temperatures above C. According to WXCHARTS maps, which use data from MetDesk, the temperatures should noticeably start to rise from Thursday, July . On this date much of central, eastern and southern England are forecast to see maximum temperatures above C. The highest temperature of C is forecast for the south-east of England.  However weather maps for Friday, July  show the heat spreading a bit further northwards, with parts of northern England also expected to see maximum temperatures hovering around  to C. By the weekend, Netweather maps show maximum temperatures of C could hit the south-east of England on Saturday, July . Across the south-east and south of England, maximum temperatures are forecast to be in the range of C to C. A similar picture is also forecast for parts of northern, eastern and central England. Scotland is predicted to see widespread temperatures within the high teen’s range, with some areas getting heat as high as C.  Northern Ireland is also likely to see temperatures above C on this date, as are many parts of Wales. In their long-range weather forecast for Monday, July  until Wednesday, July , the Met Office is predicting “dry weather and sunny spells” around the time of the weekend of July  to  for some regions. However northern and northwestern parts of the UK will also see some rain spells and some strong winds at times. The Met Office states: “Most areas will be mostly dry into the middle of next week, beyond which it is likely that the settled conditions will continue for many central and southern areas, bringing dry weather and sunny spells here. “Northern and northwestern parts will probably turn increasingly unsettled with spells of rain accompanied by stronger winds at times.  “Later in the period there is a chance that the unsettled conditions across the north may sp widely across the rest of the UK. “Temperatures near or slightly above average but perhaps warm or at times very warm in the south.” As July turns to August, the Met Office are predicting many parts of the UK “are likely to see periods of drier and settled weather”. The south is expected to see the best of the warm weather at the start of August.  And although there will be some sunny spells, there are also expected to be some spells of wet weather, largely across the north and west of the UK.Previous Met Office forecasts had suggested Brits could see Mediterranean highs as early as this Saturday, July .But the latest predictions show slightly lower temperatures - with hopes of previous highs of C fading due to winds and patchy rain in some parts.

The attack was captured on CCTV and Hughes even took a photo of Mr Nath, lying on the ground and covered in his own blood, before leaving the scene. At a sentencing hearing at Basildon Crown Court on Tuesday, prosecuting barrister Cyrus Shroff told the court that rather than walking away, Albrektaite, who was  at the time, and Hughes, , started to kick him repeatedly in the head.

He told Judge Lodge about domestic trouble in her le since she was young, however said that she accepted responsibility for what she did.  He said: She is going in to this term of punishment in the hope she can emerge better for it.

Anna Wellinska of Armley, Leeds has been tormented and abused by a group of young people for two years.The youngest member of the group is just eight-years-old, Leeds Live reported.During the latest confrontation Anna decided to film the kind of abuse she has been receiving. At the end of the encounter she claims she was left bleeding from the head after rocks were hurled at her. The video shows the boys climbing over the gate, aggressively confronting her and refusing to leave. She is called a sla*per and one of the boys even thrusts his hips towards her and calls her a f***ing b***h. Anna has called the police numerous times but says the boys know they will not face severe punishment. She said: “After this stone attack I’ve been left afraid, my head hurts and I’m now having problems with my eyes. “Iaposve been living here since  and it was quiet and now weaposre afraid to go out into the streets, friends are moving out to better neighbourhoods. “Yesterday my partner just asked them to leave her car and they would start attacking. “We are tired of living in such a place. “We want to live peacefully without the windows broken in the cars punctured tyres. Another resident said they feared there would be a stabbing after one of the boys was spotted with a kne in his pocket. They said: If you say anything to them they get aggressive. “We’re scared of another stabbing might happen, one of the boys was seen with a kne in his pocket but this was two or three months ago.  “The kids know that they are too young to be arrested and that you cant give them a slap, and they can get away with it. They’re not scared of punishment, they know full well they do what they want and you can’t lay a hand on them.” West Yorkshire Police are investigating the incidents. A spokesperson said: “Police investigated an incident where a woman was assaulted in Whingate Avenue, Armley, at about pm on July . “She had challenged two youths about their behaviour and one threw a stone at her.

Christian Brueckner is currently behind bars after being convicted of horrically raping a -year-old woman in Portugal in . Brueckner will now find out in three weekshe is likely to be released through a the complex legal loophole. Lawyers for Brueckner appeared before a  of five judges at the European Court of Justice, arguing that his detention is a breach of international law. They claim because this was not the crime he was extradited for from Portugal in June  he should be freed.  But prosecutors insisted Christian Brueckner should remain behind bars saying because he left Germany for a “holiday” he broke the law before being arrested. Felix Halabi, representing the German authorities, told the European Court: “He flouted the rules. He did not abide by the rules - he left and travelled to Italy. “So he renounced his protection. “The suspect made the most of open European borders - now he wants us to read the law in such a way it gets turned on its head and provide him an advantage in a court.” Brueckneraposs lawyers said it was unfair he was in prison and he should be released because he was being held under an “unconstitutional” reading of the law. It is a complicated technical issue and the judges - led by President Michail Vilaras - will release their views on the legal situation on th August.  But Mr Halabi, representing the German authorities, said Bruecker was simply trying to cleverly exploit a loophole in the law. He said: “Freedom of movement is of great benefit to people. “The European Arrest Warrant is of great benefit to people all over Europe. “This is a great achievement for Europe to make prosecutions more successful.” In Luxembourg today a  of five judges at the ECJ heard arguments on the complex legal issue.  Brueckneraposs lawyer Friedrich Fulscher argued that it was a breach of European law to put him on trial for rape. He claimed because this was not the crime he was extradited for from Portugal in June  he should be freed. He insisted that Brueckner’s seven year sentence for brutally attacking an American pensioner in Praia da Luz in  should now be overturned. Representatives of the Irish government also took part in the case held in the main ECJ courthouse via video conference.

The Solar Orbiter has discovered that mini solar flares called “camp fires” are constantly erupting on its surface. Designed and built in the UK, it is part of a mission to understand how solar flares may trigger electricity blackouts across Europe.Such major Space weather events can disrupt satellites and other infrastructure that mobile phones, transport, GPS signals and the electricity networks rely on.Science Minister Amanda Solloway said: “The Solar Orbiter was eight years in the making, and represents an incredible feat of UK engineering. “Now this spacecraft has helped us make this historic discovery of the ‘campfires’ near the surface of the Sun. “This mission is one of the UK’s most important space ventures for a generation.” The Solar Orbiter was constructed by Airbus in Stevenage and blasted off from Nasa’s Cape Canaveral site in Florida on February . It has been designed to withstand the scorching heat from the Sun that will hit one side, while maintaining freezing temperatures on the other side of the spacecraft as the orbit keeps it in shadow.  The spacecraft will make a close approach to the Sun every five months, and at its closest will only be  million miles away, closer than the planet Mercury. Dr Caroline Harper, head of space science at the UK Space Agency, said scientists were excited by the presence of campfires that are “millions of times smaller than the solar flares”. She said: “The science will allow us to start improving our operational capability to predict the Space weather, just like you predict the weather here on Earth.”  Occasionally the Sun erupts giant amounts of particles which slam into Earth’s magnetic field, generating surges of electrical current. Solar scientists do not have reliable ways to predict such an eruption. The largest one known to hit Earth was the Carrington event in , named after one of the people who observed an intensely bright spot on the Sun where the eruption occurred  The surge caused some telegraph wires to catch fire. A similar event today could cause a continent-wide blackout by destroying giant transformers on the electric grid, which could take years to repair. Satellite services such as communications, navigation and Earth observation supporting wider industrial activities are worth £ billion to the UK economy. The UK provided funding for four of the  scientic instruments on board the European Space Agency mission.  The campfires were captured by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager developed by scientists at University College London. Dr David Long, of UCL, said: “No images have been taken of the Sun at such a close distance before and the level of detail they provide is impressive. “They show miniature flares across the surface of the Sun, which look like campfires that are millions of times smaller than the solar flares that we see from Earth.

It’s been a great shame they haven’t been able to celebrate that.“The club will find some way of they get their day with that.“In terms of recruitment and brining players in, I’ll give the players here the opportunity.“I’ll take my time with that. Assurances is a strong word but certainly Dundee United as a club would have the ability to go out and do that,I can bring players that would make Dundee United a better team.“They’d have the ability to go into the market and bring players in that could make the team better.“If the need is there for me to go and do that, and the opportunity to bring players in from other places I believe is a good fit for the culture of the club and making the team better, then absolutely we would have the ability to do that.“The owner has told me he’d back me as has Tony Asghar and I’m happy with that.”As for how United’s embroilment in Hearts and Partick Thistle’s legal case against the SPFL affects his ability to spend, Mellon says that is for those higher up at Tannadice to say.An SFA arbitration  will hear the Jags and Jambos’ petition this week with league champions United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers mounting their own defences in the wake of the initial SPFL resolution and Court of Session action.“I think that’s a question for other people,” he said of the impact United’s legal costs on his playing budget.“I’ve, obviously, been brought here to try to improve a football team.“I’m here try to build relationships with fans and connect everybody, to make players understand the sacrices you need to make to improve and the other stuff will be taken care of by specialists.“They’ll get on with that, that’s what they’re here to do and paid to do, that’s not my remit.“I’ll do what I’m here to do which is digest training, see what I think our players need to do I order to keep moving them forward and then get out on the grass to put on sessions that will challenge them.“Once I see the improvements that need to be made, I’ll be strong with them and keep the standards really high.“I need to keep them fit and motivated and away we go. I’ll do that every day.“That’s just the way I work and operate as a manager. It’s stood me in good stead and I won’t change that.”Mellon’s track record in developing players is impressive with Leicester star Jamie Vardy one of his students at Fleetwood Town and Manchester City ace John Stones another at Barnsley.However, the Paisley-born coach was keen to point out another in Rangers defender Connor Goldson, whom Mellon had at Shrewsbury.He hopes to repeat those kind of successes at United.He added: “I had Connor Goldson. We developed him into a fantastic centre-back and sold him to Brighton for millions.“You take your time with them and see what they need to get better at. It was the same with Vardy, Stones and these kind of guys.“You look at it and know the qualities that’s needed for them to be a top player.“You recognise it and because I’ve been through it before and been successful with it before because the proof is there with the boys playing at unbelievable levels, I’m able to bring that to this group of players.“I know the techniques that are needed to show them. The training sessions or talking to them about things in a way they can grasp and understand to make them top players as well.“I really enjoy doing that and I’m so proud of all the boys who have turned out top players.”CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises\" title\"#CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-new-dundee-united-micky-mellon-making-right-noises embed # secretZZoTJol\" data-secret\"ZZoTJol\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He has watched closely and put his own inputs where he has felt he has had to, which has been good.“He has been down south all his managerial career and he comes here with new ideas and he is another top manager that we can learn from.“It is an exciting time for the whole club going into the Premiership and with the new manager coming in.“He comes across as a real players’ manager.“He told us that right at the start, for us to do well he needs us to do well.“He has told us his door is always open and he is always there to help.“We know that he is demanding and he will want to maintain the standards he has set in his time in England.“His record in England is great. He has five promotions and you can’t argue with that. It is definitely exciting times.”Former Rangers and Dunfermline man Clark was a key component of the Tangerines’ Championship title winning squad from last term.He is now hoping Mellon gives him and the other medal winners a chance to prove they can do it in the Premiership.Clark added: “The boys were excellent last season and we deservedly won the league although it wasn’t the way we wanted it to be.“At the end of the day we are champions and it is good to hear the manager will give us a chance.“However, we all know that he will bring in some new faces and over the next few days and weeks because he will want to strengthenthere are areas where he feels he needs to strengthen.“We will have to work hard and keep strivingwe want to keep raising the standards to meet the challenge of the Premiership week in, week out.”Clark ed from six months out with an ankle injury in a - friendly defeat at Motherwell on Saturday.It wasn’t the result the Terrors were after but the former Queen of the South man was just delighted to get back on the pitch.He commented: “It was a good run out. It has been a long time coming for me because it was my first game since January but it was good to get out there and going again.“It was exciting to be back playing again. I could have been backthe season hadn’t been cut short but this extra time has given me more opportunity to get everything % right and a good pre-season behind me.“It was a mix of experienced boys and younger lads but it was a good game.“We got beat - but at this stage it is all about fitness and boys coming through injury free.“The boys have all come back flying. They all tuned into it during the lockdown and we are reaping the benefits of that fitness now.”Dundee United boss Micky Mellon reveals he has backing of owner Mark Ogren in transfer market\" title\"#Dundee United boss Micky Mellon reveals he has backing of owner Mark Ogren in transfer market# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-micky-mellon-mark-ogren embed # secretrQTIok\" data-secret\"rQTIok\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Derek has brought to the club a consistency that we haven’t seen in well over a generation.“Aberdeen are really fortunate to have him as their manager, in particular at this point in time.“For me he is up there as one of the great managers of recent times.”In his seven years at Pittodrie McInnes has delivered the  League Cup and reached a further three cup finals.Aberdeen have qualied for Europe for seven successive seasons. Former chief executive Fraser was pivotal in helping the club eliminate all debt in .Six years ago an investment deal and restructuring wiped out the club’s net debt of £. million.Fraser believes being debt free was vital to help McInnes’ ambitions for the club.It also put the club in a stronger position as the coronavirus pandemic hit, despite projected losses of £m due to the Covid- outbreak.Fraser said: “Itdid help. The club has not got money coming in and we have challenging times.“CertainlyAberdeen hadn’t been in the strong financial position it was then things would have been an awful lot harder.“Being debt free was a fundamental to taking the club forward and helping the board work with Derek about where he could strengthen the squad.“We concluded that deal about a year-and-a-half after Derek arrived. It definitely helped being able to assist him more than we were able to do.”Fraser also recognised the contribution of former Scotland boss Craig Brown who was appointed manager in December  with the Reds bottom of the table.Brown and assistant Archie Knox led them to safety and also built foundations for future years.Fraser said: “Craig was able to bring real stability at the club and his work for that two-and-a-half years should always be recognised.”Fraser has also served on the boards of the SPL, SPFL and Scottish FA.He joined the SFA board in July last year having previously served as a member of the Professional Game Board.In recent months, Fraser has been a co-chair of the joint response group’s medical subgroup along with Dr John MacLean and has played a key role in helping Scottish football recover andfrom the impact of the outbreak.Fraser will officially step down from his role as non-executive board member with the SFA following the annual general meeting on Wednesday.He said: “In terms of getting players back to training and being in the position to demonstrate to the government that games could be played from August  it has been a huge undertaking.“John MacLean and medical people from ious Scottish sports institutes have been working very closely with the government behind the scenes to move this forward.”Fraser will officially step down at Pittodrie next week to begin a new career path with UEFA.He said: “I will be working through UEFA Grow with football federations throughout Europe to assist in their strategic planning and vision going forward to ensure we protect the game for future generations in a sustainable way.“This really fits the bill in terms of being involved with national associations and being able to put my experience to good use as we move forward.”Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack paid tribute to Fraser for almost two decades’ service.Cormack said: “I am grateful to Duncan for his time and dedication throughout his career at AFC.“Duncan has not only given his expertise to Aberdeen but in recent times also held an important role as a non-executive director at the Scottish FA.“As co-chair of the medical and player welfare committee, his experience has been beneficial in enabling us to get back training. We wish him all the best.”Former Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne said: “In the  years Duncan and I worked together, his counsel and loyalty were unwavering.“He helped the club achieve many of our key objectives, ultimately playing a central role in negotiating the deal that eliminated our debt.”Scottish FA interim president Mike Mulraney said: “Duncan’s experience as a chief executive and, more recently, non-executive director at Aberdeen has been hugely valuable to the Scottish FA beyond his year spent as a board member.“He has been a colleague and friend for many years and I know he will be a success in his new role .”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 12 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe selfish and reckless behaviour of many people visiting Argyll is to be deplored.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

unavailability of face masks for his family, as he faced the Covid- lockdown with a pregnant we and his dad in a high-risk category.Hass, who had previously set up a global video business, Volcano City, that saw him work with likes of footballer Neymar and pop superstar Katie Perry, spent  weeks researching the market before launching his #sasMASK brand from home, in the midst of the national lockdown.He had been looking after his four-year-old son Otto as a stay-at-home dad and living with his parents in Colinton, Edinburgh, while his home in Musselburgh was being renovated when lockdown kicked in.Their family business, making greetings cards and gts, based in premises at Newhailes Industrial Estate in Musselburgh, was also closed due to the lockdown restrictions.Hass, a member of Musselburgh Roads Cycling Club, said: ldquoDuring week one of lockdown, we discussed as a familywe needed to wear face masks.ldquoWith my dad in a high-risk category and my we Louise pregnant, we decided we did.ldquoI started shopping for good-quality masks that didnrsquot compromise the medical PPE supply chain. However, this turned out to be much trickier than I had expected.He claimed: ldquoThe face masks available at that time seemed to be distributed by untrustworthy-looking websites, looked to be of poor quality, took weeks ndashnot months ndash to arrive and were extortionately priced.ldquoI realised that I couldnrsquot be the only person facing this problem, so I decided to stop moaning and take action ndash and #sasMASK was born.He explained that the #sasMASK is manufactured in Europe and complies with the latest material and layering guidelines for non-medical-grade face coverings.It has not only been designed to be washable, comfortable and affordable, but also comes in more than  designs, with this range due to double in size in the coming weeks, he added.With the wearing of face masks now compulsory on public transport in Scotland, Screen  Shield is expecting orders to continue to surge as Hass, now back at his home in Musselburgh, fulfils hundreds of orders there until he can open a warehouse.He said: ldquoA fundamental aim of the #sasMASK brand was to create a business model that also benefited charities that support frontline workers and community groups.ldquoIt seemed to me that ndash in a health crisis ndash anyone who was selling masks should be giving back to the community, and especially to those hardest hit.ldquoI set up Screen  Shield so that  per cent of all online sales go to NHS-related charities. But any participating community groups charities influencers buying masks for their network also receive  per cent of the sales value ndash as well as their members also receiving a  per cent discount.ldquoAlong with local and national charities, wersquove had the likes of a cheerleading squad, a group of redundant BA staff, a nursery group and a community centre in Somerset all sign up to

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Matt Hunt, the CEO of Free The Bears, who is in the programme, I met him when I lived in Australia in  and we started a friendship and have grown stronger ever since. And probably up until  when I took the position, every year for the last six to eight years he must have sent me a job description or a position opening, trying to encourage me to work with or do something for Free The Bears.I was just never in the position in le where it was manageable or achievable until last year - and then I was incredibly lucky, incredibly fortunate in my sort of personal position, that I could effectively take  months out and not get paid very much at all, and go and work for Free The Bears and Matt.HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP THE EXPERIENCE It was one of the most incredible, uplting, and yet challenging periods in my le. I dont even like to call it a career because all Ive ever done since I was  is work for with animals and try and do something to have a contribution to conservation. But in all of that time, living there across  months definitely had its ups and downs to say the least.TO SEE PEOPLE FREELY ILLEGALLY TRADING THE PRODUCTS IN THE LOCAL MARKETS WOULD BE FRUSTRATING That market we went to was not a very prolic one when it comes to wildle. It was frustrating and again, not the first time and not the last time Ive seen wildle in markets... I think the frustrating thing is that the wildle trade is a very, very complex trade, and thats really now starting to become a focus in peoples minds because of the current situation that we face with coronavirus and the fact that its origins have probably come from the wildle trade.But regardless, that was definitely one of the points where I felt very low and very down afterwards because at that particular time I didnt have the authorities with me. And I dont have the authority and I dont have the place to be able to go into a wildle market and start taking wildle without the proper system to be able to back me up.So I had to walk away knowing full well that by the time Id informed the authorities and theyd been able to mobilise, the chances are the next day that those particular inidual animals would have not been there and not made it.YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT THE BEARS AS INDIVIDUALS...When we talk about conservation, and when we talk about the wildle trade, and when we talk about bears as a species, it is ultimately about them as a species... but for me its also about them as an inidual.Because Mary the sun bear, when we confiscated her from the trafficker, or David and Jane, or any of the bears, they dont know that their species is now starting to become endangered in the wild andthis continues in another five years time it could be past the tipping point.What they know of is what they feel as iniduals, which is they feel fear and they feel stress and theyre hungry because quite often most of the bears that we come across are never fed properly. It comes down to balance. I want to help that animal as an inidual, but I also want to be able to help the bigger picture when it comes to species conservation.GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS SERIES I really feel, whether its organisations like Free The Bears or programmes like Bears About The House, for me its about having that respect and compassion and kindness towards the natural world and the animals that are part of that.The most important thing that hopefully will be the bigger context of the situation,we take one thing from it, it should be that we are completely interconnected to other species and the environment around us. If we dont treat that with respect, it will be to our detriment.Bears About The House starts on July  at pm on BBC Two."},{"url":null,"title":"author-patrick-baker-five-scotlands-evocative-wild-places","story":"THERE are certain places that exist at the edge of our collective memory. Ruins and relics which are scattered across Scotlandrsquos landscape, forgotten, overlooked and often hidden by dint of sheer geographical remoteness. I have come to think of them best described as wild histories. Wild, certainly, in that they are located in wilderness areas, but wild also in an almost anthropomorphic sense: feral, uncared for, mostly unknown or nameless, and outside the boundaries of public consciousness.When thought of in this way, the landscape of Scotland becomes a vast diorama: the setting for countless narrative scenes, lives and stories overlaid, some more vivid than others. These wild but often unseen histories define us more than any iconic building or national monument, for they are records of things inconsequential and commonplace. It is this compelling and contradictory mixture of secrecy and signicance that over the years some has led me to become fascinated with some particular wild places.THE GLEN LOIN CAVES, SUCCOTHAlthough I cannot say when or how I first became aware of the Glen Loin Caves, it feels like they have always been there, hard-wired into my imagination. Most people will never have heard of them, but I have come to think of them in near-mythical terms ndash a place of refuge for drovers, brigands, outlaws and even royalty.Among other claims, they were most famously the supposed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his routed army in  after his defeat at the Battle of Methven. More recently, the maze of fallen rocks on this Argyll mountainside was the focal point of a unique, sporting counterculture.It was here for almost two decades from the s that groups of working-class young people, mainly from the poverty-stricken tenements of Glasgow and shipyards of Clydebank, congregated to climb the huge rock walls of the Arrochar Alps.They created an almost permanent weekend residence in the caves. Small groups arrived at first, each with its own particular rules and hierarchies, then more established affiliations evolved. Clubs formed here whose names still resonate with modern mountaineers: the Ptarmigan Club and the infamous Creagh Dhu. The influence of these pioneering climbers was immense, providing a surge in climbing standards and techniques that was unequalled anywhere  at the time. They also redefined the sport, dismantling existing class barriers and creating a makesht society in the Glen Loin Caves whose values and ethics became imprinted on generations of climbers that were to follow.Yet the caves and their whereabouts have managed to remain largely unknown for decades. Hidden partly by the obscurity of the landscape, but also by an unwritten code of fraternal discretion.lsquoThe lad with the clinker-nailed boots and the rope in his rucksack who told me how to find the cave made me promise to keep the secret,rsquo wrote Alastair Borthwick in , in one of the earliest and most detailed descriptions of the caves.lsquoI was to follow a track to a foresterrsquos cottage, pass through a gate . . . and there search for an old sheep fank. Behind it I should find a faint track leading up the hillside andI followed the scratches on the rock it led to, I should find the cave and good company.rsquoEven at close proximity, however, the caves are frustratingly hard to locate. In  it took the writer Rennie McOwan, an accomplished outdoorsman, several attempts to pinpoint the exact position of Borthwickrsquos earlier description. lsquoYou can trace these historic cavesyou know where to lookrsquo, McOwan advised matter-of-factly, lsquobut it can be both time-consuming, and exasperatingyou do not.rsquoTHE NAVVIESrsquo GRAVEYARD, NEAR KINLOCHLEVENAt the start of the th century, in a remote glen in the West Highlands, thousands of navvies were at work on a huge hydroelectric scheme: a massive civil-engineering project near Kinlochleven, which included the construction of the reservoir, a six-kilometre aqueduct and an aluminium-smelting plant.For some of the men that worked there all the inherent danger of their job would suddenly coalesce in a single instant. With a sudden evaporation of luck ndash the misplaced sledgehammer blow, a momentrsquos loss of balance or the abrupt death-strike of unseen rock-fall ndash lives were ended in the wind-torn reaches of the moor.They were laid to rest near where they fell, in a small, improvised burial ground situated below the steep walls of the reservoir. This was the place that the author Patrick MacGill described in his radicalsemi-autobiographical novel Children of the Dead End ndash the navviesrsquo graveyard. It is still bleakly visible in the middle of the vast moor: three rows of headstones sectioned off by a low picket fence, the wood weathered to bone-grey.Even at a distance, its appearance is surreal. It has a strangely filmic quality: dramatic and out of place, like a set design ready to be used in a High Plains western. The gravestones, which were made with concrete from the dam, sit low in the ground, blotched with lichen and listing at angles in the soil.A few have been etched with simple decorative borders, and some carry names ndash all either Irish or Scottish. One in particular stands out, the grave of a woman, buried alongside the men. It challenges perceptions of the place as an exclusively male working environment. The thought of both men and women working here suggests perhaps something more civilised, than the lawless encampment described in MacGillrsquos book ndash a settlement or even a community.Despite the lack of embellishments, the inscriptions on the headstones are exact: neat letterings carved with considerable care. The same effort has been applied to all of them, including one ndash an anonymous grave ndash which, in the absence of a name, simply has the words lsquonot knownrsquo traced delicately across its centre. The gesture is touching. The stonemasonsrsquo precise work, their attention to detail and unbiased craftsmanship, even for an unidentied colleague, still feels like an act of considerable compassion.BELNAHUA, THE SLATE ISLESThe Slate Isles take their collective name from their geological renown. Fine-grained slate rock is found in abundance here in several rich deposits and has been mined since prehistoric times. By the th century the area was held in such importance it was mentioned by Donald Monro, High Dean of the Isles, in his landmark account of the Western Isles.In the centuries that followed, small-scale mining evolved into massive commercial harvesting of the mineral resource. In , the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant recorded that slates of lsquomerchantable sizesrsquo were being exported in quantities of lsquoabout two million and a half . . . annually to England, Norway, Canada and the West Indiesrsquo.By the middle of the th century this number had grown as much as seven times, and the Slate Isles found themselves at the centre of a global industry, providing jobs to hundreds of workers and supplying roofing materials for buildings all around the world.All that, however, would change. A series of natural and economic calamities, beginning with a storm surge of epic proportions, rendered the mines unworkable and the area destitute. Large swathes of the population left, never to , and the land assumed a look of devastation, houses abandoned and machinery left to rust.The most beguiling of all the islands is the uninhabited Belnahua, the furthest outlier in the small archipelago. A ghost village now exists there rows of empty workersrsquo cottages that still look out over the slate quarry which has long since flooded to form a deep, stilled lagoon.I journeyed there by sea-kayak across some of Scotlandrsquos fastest tidal races, making landfall in front of hollow-eyed buildings with window and door spaces showing light-filled interiors.The best view comes from climbing up a prism-shaped knoll in the middle of the island. From up high you can see the structures that once housed the small community. As well as the terraced workersrsquo cottages, there are a scattering of other buildings: pump houses and engine rooms, coal sheds and outhouses. On the eastern side are two more substantial-looking buildings ndash a two-storey house and a bothy.What is most remarkable though is the slate mine itself now a single flooded quarry of dark water that fills the centre of the island like an ink well. The gouged area is so large that in places only a narrow boundary of land has been left to buffer against the sea.EL ALAMEIN REFUGE, THE CAIRNGORMSNo other mountain area in the British Isles can claim to have had such a large proleration of bothies and high-level shelters as the Cairngorms. By the mid-s, a constellation of these refuges existed across the range, providing a basic form shelter for climbers and mountaineers to overnight on their expeditions in and around the plateau.The names of the old Cairngorm sheltershave always held an undeniable mystique for me. They seem redolent of a bygone, pioneering era of mountaineering. A time, it seemed, when enthusiasm and exuberance appeared to outweigh adversity and a lack of proper equipment.Most of the shelters have long since disappeared: Bob Scottrsquos Bothy destroyed by fire, Jeanrsquos Hut, and the Sinclair Hut run into dereliction or dismantled the Curran and the St Valery demolished. There is one, however, that has for the most part been largely forgotten about. Situated at over , feet somewhere on the steep western flank of Strath Nethy, the El Alamein hut is dficult to find, it walls constructed entirely from rocks barely visible amid a hillside of boulders.The positioning of the El Alamein refuge was a mistake. It was never intended to be built on the northern spur of Cairn Gorm Mountain, tucked literally out of sight and notionally out of mind in a rarely ventured-to part of the Cairngorms. The story goes that its placement was a navigational error. Built by members of st Highland Division and named after one their most famous battles, a mix-up in grid references lead to its construction not on the high plateau, like its sister hut the St Valery, but on an incidental ridgeline.In , the El Alamein and the other two high-level shelters of the Cairngorm plateau became implicated in the Feith Buidhe disaster ndash to this day, the worst, single tragedy in British mountaineering history. Following recommendations of the subsequent fatal accident enquiry, a decision was made to remove of all three of the shelters. Their presence on the plateau was deemed an unacceptable risk. Notoriously hard to locate, it was thought they created a  sense of security, inviting the inexperienced and unprepared to rely unrealistically on finding their protection ndash an often impossible task in winter.After several years of highly publicised and emotive debate, two of the shelters were pulled down. But for whatever reason, the El Alamein never followed suit. Its obscurity and lack of purpose perhaps became the reason for its survival: a barely known mountain refuge, located high on a quiet ridgeline, where it remains to this day.INCHKEITH ISLAND, FIRTH OF FORTHBlack and brooding in the Firth of Forth, Inchkeith Island is easily seen, but often overlooked. I have flown over it many times. On homeward-bound planes which bank low over the coast, you get a gullrsquos eye view of the island.It gives you the chance to survey its complex, post-apocalyptic townscape: deserted roads and decaying buildings, greenery threading through concrete, shrubs emerging from the rubble. Itrsquos a contradictory but compelling mix. A strange scene of urban dereliction in an elemental and unconnected place.That the architecture and edices of dferent times could still exist so forgotten and untouched, yet so geographically close to Scotlandrsquos capital, seems paradoxical, but also makes perfect sense. For centuries, Inchkeithrsquos wild form and isolated position ndash a craggy, kilometre-long, hill-topped rock in the wide, storm-blasted waters of the Forth ndash has both alternatingly defined its importance and rendered it a landscape that can easily be cast aside.Over the centuries it has served a multitude of purposes. Fortress, garrison, farm, lazaretto, prison, religious settlement and even the venue for a bizarre linguistic experiment. As backstories go, it can certainly claim an eventful and troubled past, and more than conforms to the writer Patrick Barkhamrsquos contention that lsquoa few square miles of island loom far larger than the equivalent pocket of land on the mainlandrsquo.The same is also true for the other islands scattered in the Forth, the lsquoemeralds chased in goldrsquo of Walter Scottrsquos epic poem Marmion. Each, I have found out, have their own rich narratives, outsized stories that are much bigger than their contained landmasses would suggest. They are tales of human and natural history ndash warfare and piracy, extinction and regeneration ndash that are intimately entwined with the lives of people far beyond their immediate watery domains.One of Inchkeithrsquos most interesting histories involves its role as a staging post for an attempted invasion of Leith. On  September, a flotilla of privateer warships had reached Inchkeith Island and lay anchored off its shores waiting to attack the port. The small fleet was led by the infamous naval commander John Paul Jones, a Scot by birth who had joined the Continental Navy of the American Colonies and was wreaking havoc around Britainrsquos coastline. Jones was about to mount his offensive when he was suddenly stopped by an unexpected and ferocious storm. Leith was spared by the skin of its teeth, marking a curious historic footnote ndashperhaps the only time Scotland has ever been close to invasion by a military force of what would become the United States.The Unremembered Places: Exploring Scotlandrsquos Wild Histories by Patrick Baker is out now Follow @WildHistorianAs Scotlandrsquos wild places become accessible again, enthusiasm to discover wild histories should always be accompanied by the principle of lsquoleaving no tracersquo: please tread lightly, leave no litter, do not disturb historical relics and respect Scotlandrsquos natural environment."},{"url":null,"title":"hurrah-pubs-reopening---love-even-worst","story":"This drastic remedy would probably not meet with Health and Safety approval, yet Mr McFadden might have hit on a winning tactic, as the pubs reopen. ldquoPeople are like sheep, he said, explaining the fencersquos effectiveness.

Pick out the juicy tidbits. Is that not the tabloid way, the branch of journalism with which he is most closely associated Look closer, however, and all is not as it seems. The Farage story is fresh, but the Church tale was first aired at the Leveson Inquiry and the Succession point is mere observation. Yet that mix of modes, slipping between fact and fiction, objective and subjective, is the Murdoch way too.Hard man to pin down, Mr Murdoch. This three-part series, a sort of Dynasty without the shoulder pads, was the latest attempt to unravel the enigma, and it showed promising signs of having the chutzpah to go further than its predecessors. Or at the very least make a decent fist of a fascinating story.Made by  Films, the production company behind  , a six part series on the attacks on the US, the first episode featured many of the usual suspects ndash Piers Morgan, once a Murdoch editor, Alastair Campbell, ex-press secretary to Blair, etc ndash saying pretty much what you would expect.The strength of the piece lay in the way it built a story about power: who had it and who did not, and what that meant for the rest of us.So the first episode laid bare the great Blair-Murdoch bromance, begun in earnest when the Labour leader flew to Australia to woo the media boss and his executives. According to Campbell, Murdoch said his rapprochement with Blair was like two porcupines making love: it had to be done very slowly and very carefully. ldquoBit f****** weird, said Campbell.It got weirder. Once New Labour was in government, having secured the backing of the Murdoch empire, the relationship became ldquoalmost incestuous, said Andrew Neil.How close they became was illustrated by the tale of Blair and the euro. In a piece for the News of the World, Blair promised that the UK would not join the EU currency without a referendum. This, according to Nigel Farage, was the price of Murdochrsquos support for New Labour ndash asked and granted.ldquoIf Rupert Murdoch had not done that we would have joined the euro in  and I doubt Brexit would have happened, claimed Farage.What happened next in the programme was more remarkable. The interview over, Faragersquos lapel microphone was taken off. But the main mic was still running.ldquoTo be honest, said Farage, relaxing into off camera mode even though the recording was still going on, ldquoI did ask him whether he wanted me to do this, andhe said no I wouldnrsquot have done it. But he said yes, do it.Now, presuming ldquohe was Murdoch, did this mean the media boss was trying to spin a documentary about himself, to make himself look even more powerful That the filmmakers included the Farage \"extra\" was a promising sign that they were ready to engage in some journalistic rough and tumble of their own to get the story. One fancied Mr Murdoch,he was watching, might have approved.The film had promised to look at the ldquorise and fall and rise again of the dynasty, and by the end of episode one we had entered the phone hacking saga, the point at which the empire quaked.Throughout, the most fascinating segments were those looking at the Murdoch heirs. Much of the material on that subject came from an ABC Australia series, Dynasties: The Murdochs. Whether there will be anything new to add on this, and any other matter, depends on those who have worked most closely with Murdoch speaking out.Thus far, no dice. The most noteworthy thing said by Les Hinton, who worked for Murdoch for  years, concerned a get-to-know you dinner between his boss and the Blairs. ldquoCheriersquos a bit strange but I like him, was Murdochrsquos assessment. Hardly stop the press stuff, but stick around: there might be more to come."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-tate-greenock-can-give-perspective-links-slavery","story":"I read with interest that MSP Stuart McMillan proposes that they be made into a museum detailing Scotlandrsquos links with the slave trade .Until  the building was used by sugar refiners Tate and Lyle. The Tate part of the name is the family that founded the Tate Gallery in London, now named Tate Britain. Galleries have subsequently been established in London , St Ives and Liverpool. The Tate Liverpool is in a building and setting very similar to the Greenock Sugar Sheds.The sugar sheds are massive. I understand that the Tate has a huge amount of paintings in storage. The establishment of a ldquoTate Greenock, incorporating an exhibition of Glasgowrsquos links to slavery as an adjunct to a gallery of paintings would be a wonderful way of illustrating Greenockrsquos history in the round.Bruce Walker, Largs.IT was very encouraging to see your report about proposals to use the old sugar sheds at Watt Dock in Greenock for a museum about Scotlandrsquos connections with slavery.This would be an excellent venue by the Clyde where the great sugar and tobacco loads were deposited. It would also be a way of bringing much-needed public and private investment into Inverclyde. MSP Stuart McMillanrsquos proposal to seek support from those firms and families who were associated with slavery would be a practical way of making reparations.The link with Rabbie Burns and his proposed le in plantation administration is another aspect of th century Scottish le that would be worthy of further exploration. Unlike some, I would not be too critical of Burnss plans to move to Jamaica given the poverty and brutality of Scottish farming le at that time. His beautul tribute, A Slaversquos Lament, shows his empathy for those trapped in the terrible circumstances of slavery. I doubt he would have lasted long in Jamaica.On frequent trips to Liverpool I have been a visitor to the wonderful Slavery Museum on the Quayside. On every visit there has been a very erse collection of visitors-schoolchildren, tourists and families of all backgrounds from the North West. The many exhibitions feature commentaries from young people from local schools and visitors. It is very clear from their input that they have taken the museumrsquos message about the need for tolerance and respect for human rights, very seriously.A Scottish museum about slavery would open up many opportunities for students and researchers to produce original material. There are many stories waiting to be told about those ex slaves who became part of Scottish nineteenth Century le and active in radical politics welcoming ex-slave, abolitionist Frederick Douglass on his tours from  onwards.This would be a very worthwhile project to support the Black Lives Matter Campaign.Maggie Chetty, Glasgow G."},{"url":null,"title":"empty-offices-mandatory-masks","story":"The Daily MailRichard Littlejohn believes the lting of lockdown has not been lsquothe great liberation we were all hoping for.rsquoldquoSome of Britainrsquos biggest firms are refusing totheir offices to full capacity, he said. ldquoCompanies in the financial sector, including Barclays and Deloitte, will continue to let up to  per cent of their staff work from home.He said just a tenth of the , Goldman Sachs employees had ed to the office.ldquoThe City of London, the nationrsquos economic powerhouse, may not revert to normal until the New Year, at the earliest.

The executioners wore masks and obeyed the rules of ldquosocial distancing except when they needed to get close enough to inject the pentobarbital. The prison in which Mr Lee was killed was also hit by the virus and was closed to all visitors in March in an attempt to save lives, including, presumably, the le of Mr Lee .To make matters worse, the virus has compromised the system thatrsquos supposed to represent the people facing execution. Mr Lee, who was sentenced to death for his involvement in the murder of a couple and their eight-year-old daughter, had not been able to see his lawyer Ruth Friedman for months. ldquoI canrsquot do my job right, she said a few weeks ago. ldquoNobody can.:Mark Smith: Scottish independence is not inevitable, but we all need to change the way we look at itNone of this should be surprising ndash Donald Trump said he would resume federal executionsand thatrsquos what hersquos done. Hersquos also made the decision in the knowledge most Americans will support him and may not care about the details. Daniel Lewis Lee was an angry and dangerous man, but he was also abused and neglected as a kid. Billy Wardlow was sentenced to death for murder, but when he committed the crime, he was  years old.Sadly, this is often how the story of executions goes, including executions in Scotland. The last man to be hanged here was Henry John Burnett, who murdered his girlfriends husband. As a child, Burnett spent time in borstals and later tried to kill himself the case also happened before legal aid, so he was defended by somebody with virtually no experience of criminal defence. He was executed in Aberdeen in , aged .If any good did come out of the case, it was that it probably expedited the abolition of the death penalty in Britain ndash it happened two years later. But whatrsquos striking is that, despite the abolition, public support for capital punishment was strong in this country and remains relatively high. The most recent Scottish Attitudes Survey shows about half the population supports the death penalty for some crimes.Itrsquos interesting that opinion is ided in this way at a time when it feels like almost every subject, including independence, is split into a binary yes or no, but the breakdown is dferent. We know therersquos a strong socially conservative streak in Scotland but it cuts across all the parties. In the case of Labour, part of its traditional working class support is hard on criminal justice, and in the SNP, the less progressive wing of the movement partly explains the creation of new pro-independence parties led by voices whorsquove been sceptical on issues such as trans rights.:Mark Smith: Anti-Scottish  I think Irsquom finally facing up to my prejudiceWhat all this means is we should remember wersquore not really as progressive as we think we are and that, while support for the death penalty has dropped from about two-thirds in the s, it is still extraordinary that half the Scottish population thinks itrsquos a good idea for the state to kill people. They may even have a preferred method: injection, electrocution, who knows.We should also note that, although therersquos no realistic prospect of the death penalty ing in Britain ndash or in an independent Scotland for that matter ndash it has become a little bit easier in the last few months. As a member of the EU, the UK was banned from reintroducing the death penalty but now that wersquore out of the EU no such ban applies anymore. So, in theory, it could happena future government wanted it.The hope must be, surely, that Scotlandrsquos changing attitudes on capital punishment and other liberal issues such as sexuality would prevent anyto the death sentence. But itrsquos worth remembering that governments do not always follow public opinion. The death penalty was abolished in the s even though the vast majority of people supported it, so presumably the reverse could happen and a future government could ignore public opinion and reintroduce it.: Mark Smith: Take a good look at the Tories who support English independence because it is Scotlandrsquos story tooItrsquos also worth remembering that, although support for the death penalty has dropped since the s, it has dropped at a very slow rate. Yes, itrsquos   now, but think about this: therersquos a good chance that every second person in Scotland will look at the executions of Billy Wardlow and Daniel Lewis Lee during a global effort to save lives and think: good, justice has been served, job done.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

From my involvement I can confidently state that the one constant in this situation has been the rapidity by which the volume and quality of data relating to the virus has increased and knowledge and understanding of its impact has informed the need to adapt our response to reflect this.At the outset each country took its own stance relative to the scientic evidence available at the time. Inevitably this stance was clearly informed by politics and we can see the results of that by a comparison, albeit simplistic, between, for example, New Zealand and the United States.The situation in which we now find ourselves across the UK reflects this. At the outset the available science within the UK led the Westminster and the devolved governments to the same starting point. However, as the scientic evidence grew, Westminster chose one path while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland took a dferent approach which reflected the same principles as those countries throughout the world who sought to eliminate rather than contain the virus.The evidence now clearly suggests this path has been the more circumspect, while only time will tell whether it proves to be wholly successful. What is clear, however, is that the actions of the devolved governments have been taken based around a structured and strategic response to evidence rather than, as appears to be the case, a series of ill-considered reactions to prevailing political dynamics that seems to characterise the Westminster administration.It has also been the case that far from relying on \"common sense\" as promoted by the politicians, those tasked with ing the athletes to training have been extremely prescriptive about what constitutes good, and safe practice leaving no room for doubt as to what is required. While that may appear to be dictatorial and imposing on an iniduals freedom, in reality one inidual not complying with protocols can have a serious effect on everyone  around them.These are unprecedented times, calling for clarity and effective governance. I leave it to others to determine the degree to which this has been achieved across the UK.Bill Mitchell, Kyle of Lochalsh.I HAVE had asthma all my le, and contrary to what youre told, after five decades it never gets any easier. I also have dficulty wearing the now-mandatory facemask for a prolonged period - after two hours I am struggling to breathe, and am obliged to head home to take it off.But the crux of the matter is none of us should be staying out longer than necessary anyway. To paraphrase the old rabies adverts, Covid- is still a killer.To those bleating about their \"freedom\", would you sooner have \"cabin fever\" or Covid- fever  Until theres a reliable cure, thats the gamble you take with your own le and everyone you come into contact with.Israel and the United States are now paying horric prices for their complacency and hubris - let their fate be our warning.Mark Boyle, Johnstone."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-facemask-hostility-predictable---seen-everything-seatbelts-vaccines","story":"It was described as a \"monstrous imposition\" by Tory MP Desmond Swayne, while on Twitter the hashtag #Muzzle took off as opponents bemoaned being told what to do by ministers.The tone had Trumpian undercurrents at times, echoing the presidents comments to a journalist wearing a facemask during a recent press conference when he mocked him for \"wanting to be politically correct\".And hand-in-hand with the characterisation of a public health measure as nanny-statism or a nefarious attack on liberty came the claims that facemasks themselves could harm your health.For this, see the proleration of internet posts relating to pulse oximeters where cynics had used them to measure supposed declines in their blood oxygen levels while sitting at home wearing masks.: Antibody study suggests less than % of Scotlands population has been infected with coronavirus so farThere is no actual scientic evidence that wearing masks can cause hypoxia - but plenty of evidence that catching coronavirus will. And anyone with serious breathing dficulties such as asthma is exempt anyway.Compared to England and the US - where there have been public protests against mandatory facemasks - hostility to the rule in Scotland has not been so pronounced, perhaps because we have less of a libertarian tradition.But among those who are opposed the same tropes emerge: dislike of being told what to dosuspicions that it might actually be harmful and scepticism of the evidence.What is interesting though, is that all this follows a well-worn template. Take seatbelts, for example.No one expects it to be routinely enforced by the police we do it because it could potentially save our own or others lives in a crash.But there was a time when seatbelts were considered controversial.The state of Wisconsin in the US was the first place to make front seatbelts a legal requirement in all cars built from  onwards.By then, there had already been fierce debate for  years that they might do more harm than good - for example, that they might cause internal injuries or make it more dficult to escape a vehicle which was ablaze or submerged in water. There were claims it would be safer to be \"thrown clear\".There were also arguments that wearing them should be a personal choice, not a legal mandate. Some car owners cut the seatbelts out of their cars in protest.: Slower exit from lockdown has had marginal effect on Covid infections and deathsAs recently as the s most Americans did not use them, and  per cent were opposed to them being enforced by law. As with muzzles for facemasks, seatbelts were depicted as tying up drivers.All this came against a backdrop of a landmark exposeacute in  - Unsafe at Any Speed - by consumer protection campaigner, Ralph Nader, which revealed car manufacturers reluctance to sacrice profits for safety features, despite mounting evidence around preventable death and injury.By the early s both the US and UK were finally making the wearing of seatbelts a legal requirement for drivers and front seat passengers. In, the law was extended in the UK to children in backseats, and to adults sitting in the rear from .Compliance among drivers and passengers is now well over % in Britain, with non-seatbelt wearers accounting for a disproportionate share of road crash fatalities - % in .Vaccination is another area of public health where the science around its benefits has become polluted by conspiracy theories and, of course, the persistent  claims of a link between MMR and autism.Some of the hostility is rooted in ignorance about the science, or scepticism about the motives of \"profiteering\" pharmaceutical companies. But it is also a simple dislike for \"being told what to do\".Immunisation is only effective in terms of creating herd immunityenough of the population comply. If enough people are vaccinated, a given infection has little opportunity to spread.: Why some scientists think handwashing and distancing might be insufficient to limit Covid spreadThat not only protects those who are immunised, but those with health conditions that make vaccination too dangerous. Nonetheless, making vaccination compulsory remains controversial - but sometimes its needed.Even in cases where the dangers are really not in dispute - such as passive smoking - it is hard to imagine that the elimination of indoor smoking would have been achieved without a legal ban.Like vaccination, unless enough people wear masks we wont see the benefit - and really, the purpose is to safeguard the most vulnerable whose own health perhaps might mean they cannot wear one.There is nothing to lose and, potentially, quite a lot to gain."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11576021.jpg?type=article-full","title":"herald-campaign-garden-remembrance-provide-sunshine-hope-experts-sought-design-stage","story":"As a specially convened steering group set up to take The Heralds garden of remembrance campaign forward met for the first time, it is looking to incorporate the colour yellow which has now become associated with those who have lost their lives to coronavirus.Steering group member Rev Neil Galbraith said the garden could have a link to the idea of sunshine as a way of highlighting the memorial for generations to come.Fellow steering group member and gardening expert Dave Allan, who writes for The Herald Magazine, added: \"I think the colour of planting is very important and the use of the colour yellow would be very calming.\"I think the idea of water would be important as it can be very soothing.\"Read more: Herald Memorial Garden: Everything you need to knowThe campaign to create a garden as a tribute to those in Scotland who have lost their lives to the coronavirus is also looking to enlist the help of a landscape architect.Our aim is to reach the design stage for the memorial garden and bring experts on board.

The party commands the stage, its performance is incredible, but what lies beneath its feet is so unsteady that therersquos the expectation that something awful is going to happen at any moment. For the audience, this mix of quizzical admiration and a sense of mounting calamity mean itrsquos impossible to look away.However, as an audience, the Scottish public today finds itself at the interval ndash kept on tenterhooks with the lead character, the SNP, poised precisely midway between absolute victory and complete defeat.In a Western world where trust in politics is supposedly dead, the SNP defies the new norm. After a shaky start to handling Covid ndash which many commentators, myself included, rightly gave Nicola Sturgeon a hard time for ndash the Scottish Government broke out of effective lockstep with the shambolic UK administration. As Boris Johnsonrsquos government staggered from one insulting, dangerous absurdity to another, Sturgeon projected calm and honesty ndash at the very least she was able to convincingly present herself as a person voters can trust.If looked at from the perspective of history, therersquos certainly an academic argument to be had, weighing the dferences between how Edinburgh and London faired over the unfolding course of the pandemic. Some will say that in terms of hard policy therersquos been little substantial dference in the actions of the two governments, and that when it comes to the numbers of fatalities therersquos really not a lot statistically between the UK and Scotland. However, that perspective is increasingly more dficult to accept with each passing day as the dferences between the two countries and their approach to Covid become more starkly defined.The harsh truth, however, is that policy nuance and the fine detail of statistics donrsquot really matter that much in political terms. What matters is: are you a convincing and trusted leader  When it comes to Johnson the answer is a screaming No with Sturgeon itrsquos a resounding Yes. Put bluntly, Johnson brings fear, and Sturgeon reassurance. That alone, as political capital, is worth a vault of gold.The party is booming in the polls.

The party seems assured of more success at the next Holyrood elections. Surely, this is hegemony Even the looming big political hurdles and intergovernmental fights seem designed to play to the SNP, rather than damage it.

Today, profits looks rosy for the SNP, but losses are coming, and soon.The forthcoming inquiry into the Alex Salmond debacle will ndash as even the animals in Edinburgh Zoo know ndash pour acid over the party. The currency of trust could quickly devalue. Faith could become revulsion. Scandal could supersede success.This corrosive circus comes as the Yes movement starts to split, reflecting the deep, dangerous fissures within the SNP. For a long time, therersquos been a growing gulf between fundamentalists and gradualists. Now a new independence party has appeared threatening list votes for Yes.The SNP is ided not just over how to achieve independence ndash and when ndash but on a flotilla of existential issues. The splits are town-country, populist-centrist, woke-traditionalist, green-business, left-right, and even Leave-Remain.Inevitably, for an umbrella party which needs to pull as many into its big tent as possible, minor fights are taking on the shape of destructive ision. That big tent has been up so long that punters inside are starting to turn on each other.Then therersquos the perception of growing anti-English sentiment. To be fair, the perception is mostly driven by fringe extremists many of whom have nothing to do with the broader Yes movement. But as with trust in the SNP over Covid, itrsquos perception that matters not facts. When the First Minister has to tell voters she doesnrsquot have ldquoan anti-English bone in her body, itrsquos clear matters have gone off message.

These will be the toilets at the Travel Centre and St Magnus Lane in Kirkwall and at the Pier Head and Ferry Road in Stromness – with more to follow over the weeks ahead.The council says each will have one ladies’ toilet, one gents’ toilet and an accessible toilet available for use.“Hygiene and physical distancing requirements mean that considerable work is needed at each site before the toilets open again,” said Hayley Green, OIC’s head of IT and facilities.“This means that it isn’t possible for us to open all of Orkney’s public toilets in one go.“You will notice quite a few changes inside and outside the toilets. Please follow the instructions we’re providing in order to minimise any risks to yourself and our cleaning staff.“Work is carrying on to re-open more public toilets over the next few weeks # keep an eye on social media and the OIC website for further updates.”OIC have also provided the answers to some frequently asked questions about the re-opening of the public toilets.We need to introduce quite a lot of physical changes to our public toilets in order to meet Scottish Government guidance. We are also having to arrange to clean them more often, and so we are discussing with our staff and contractors about how this will be done. This is why we can’t open all the toilets on the th, but we are aiming to have all public toilets open during August. There will be physical changes both outside and inside the toilets. You will be asked to follow physical distancing markers outside the toilet, and not all the facilities inside the toilet will be available. Because of this, please allow a little longer for your visit as you may need to wait for the toilets to be free. The toilets will need to be cleaned more frequently, and we will provide liquid soap for you to use to wash your hands, as well as a supply of cleaning products as required. We would ask everyone to please leave the soap and the cleaning products in the toilets for the next person to use # please do not take them away with you. There is still some element of risk around using public toilets, and that is why we are having to make the changes described above. We are following Scottish Government guidance, which can be found here: https:www.gov.scot publications coronavirus-covid--public-and-customer-toilets-guidance pages hygiene-measures We have carried out risk assessments for each site and also a general risk assessment for the process of cleaning the toilets during the pandemic. All of our staff are being briefed on any changes to their working practices and equipment, including PPE where needed, will be provided. Trade Unions have been provided with the risk assessments and given the chance to make any comments. We are currently working with our cleaners, including those who do relief cleaning for the council, as well as our contractors to assess their availability. If we need more cleaners, we will be looking to advertise this and recruit folk over the next few weeks.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Palaces are set to remain closed until Spring , and no date has been given, so far, for the reopening of Maeshowe.Meanwhile, unticketed and unstaffed HES sites will be open to visitors from this Wednesday.HES has set out its approach to the reopening of its heritage sites across Scotland as COVID- restrictions are eased.With over  properties in its care, HES is adopting a phased approach to reopen  per cent of its free to access and ticketed properties by mid-September, during Phase Three of the Scottish Government’s route map.On Wednesday July , HES will provide access to over  unstaffed and key-keeper sites across Scotland where physical distancing can be readily maintained and where HES can provide free and safe access.Visitors, including members, will be required to pre-book tickets online and to use contactless payment where possible one-way systems will be implemented in some locations and some areas of sites, such as enclosed spaces, will be closed off to visitors. Visitor numbers will also be limited for safety reasons.Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: “At the forefront of our planning is the safety of our staff and visitors, whilst being able to reopen for the tourist season by gradually enabling safe access to our properties and facilities in line with Scottish Government guidance.“We’ve been working exceptionally hard to ensure our properties will be accessible and ready to welcome visitors, however, it’s important that we implement our resumption plans at the right time given the dferent requirements for each site.“This also includes looking at the ying local and regional requirements throughout the country and we have considered this when setting out our phased approach to welcoming visitors back and supporting Scotland’s tourism and economic recovery.”“We’re very much looking forward to welcoming visitors back to our sites. There will of course be some initial changes including managing visitor numbers at certain sites, as well as restricting access to specic locations, but we can assure visitors of a warm welcome as always.“We want to ask our visitors to help create a safe environment by behaving responsibly and following our guidance at properties, and we will be providing further information on our website for visitors to help them prepare for their visit.”HES has also published policy and guidance for the reopening of the properties in its care.The standards have been developed from a wide range of sector and industry advice, guidance and best practice, and set the benchmark for the safe reopening of sites and resumption of operational activities. The Operating Standards have been published to provide a resource for the wider heritage sector, and to support and assist other organisations with their own resumption planning.For further information on the re-opening please visit www.historicenvironment.scotTo view the COVID- Policy and minimum operating standards, visit: historicenvironment.scot covid--operating-standardscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will see the installation of a new  kilovoltcable which follows the existing route from Murkle Bay, near Thurso, to Rackwick Bay in Hoy. The cable is expected to arrive by Wednesday next week, July .SSEN has said the installation of the new cable will allow for the removal of some sections of existing overhead line on Hoy, to be replaced with underground cable. Work is expected to be completed by November, following an extension of the programme to avoid construction during bird breeding season on the island.Mark Rough, director of customer operations, with SSEN, said: “We’re committed to ensuring a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers and this critical investment project is an essential part of that commitment.“We’d like to thank all stakeholders for their feedback on our proposals during our open-door events last year. Following consultation, we’ve scheduled installation to minimise disruption on local marine le, with the works also planned to avoid the main breeding seasons for key bird populations.“I’d like to reassure our customers that our teams and contracting partners continue to adhere to social distancing measures and Government guidance to protect the safety of the local community as we carry out this signicant programme of works.”The Pentland Firth East cable was identied for replacement after routine inspections found it was coming to the end of its operational le. In July , SSEN successfully completed repairs to the cable in Rackwick Bay following a cable fault. While customer power supplies were not impacted by this fault, a long-term solution was required to maintain a safe, secure and reliable power supply to homes and businesses in Orkney.For more information on the Pentland Firth East cable replacement project, click here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But he soldiered on to complete his first nine holes in an estimable  shots.Goodness only knows what happened at half time but he required only  shots for the second nine, a gross score of  and a nett  which was to be the joint lowest nett score recorded during the whole weekend.Great stuff there and with a higher handicap than all those around him and very much in contention he has nothing to lose in the second and final round.Best wishes Ross-great play!Of course that#s only one round gone but with one still to play the likeliest contenders to depose those already occupying the qualying positions could be Chris Mackinnon, Murdo Gordon, John Finlayson, Robert Macaskill or even Dan Macdonald.Chris was  , Murdo#s halves were  , John#s loops were  , Robert was   and finally young Dan was  .All these guys have a chance depending on how the leaders perform next time out but an honourable mention for John Finlayson who, like Ally Young in the RNLI Shield last time out compiled a fine score in the worst of the conditions.Sunday dawned cold, wet and very windy and both he and his companion for the day wondered at the outset whether they would be able to complete their round as the greens were already holding water.Two birdies in the final three holes of the first nine must have inspired John to dig in and that is exactly what he did to retain his chance of qualication.Although the competition is played off scratch the four players with the best two-round handicap scores will compete for the consolation #handicap# championship.A meritorious performance here to consider for inclusion might well come from Hamish Philp whose nett  off a  handicap was a terric performance in his renaissance as a golfer.Obviously off that highish handicap his numbers won#t compare too favourably with the #lower# men but two loops of  and  in the steady Saturday morning rain should give him a tremendous boost of confidence for both round two and the rest of this fledgling season Sunday morning#s weather conditions meant the scheduled ladies’ competition was abandoned without a ball being hit.However, a couple of days later a lovely sunny and warm Tuesday welcomed a small group for another round in the Glamaig Stableford competition and yet again Sandi Beatson was declared to be the clear winner.That#s four successive victories and this time the margin was six points over her nearest pursuants Sandra Dew and Shona Jackson.With respect the scoring wasn#t great but was readily acceptable within the confines of the competitors and that#s plenty good enough.The first midweek competition of this much-delayed men#s season was played for the Strath Cup.This trophy is usually decided on a season-long, best three from four scores basis but the club mandarins have to cut and paste a structure in this necessarily compressed playing season to keep the members and competitors happy so it was all or nothing in one single day.And what a day it turned out to be with warm sunshine and just a whisper of a breeze for the thirteen hours of competition.The fly in the ointment though was John-the-Greens# concept of what constitutes a #challenging# hole position on his well-nourished, nicely manicured putting surfaces.Rumour has it that he#s #a bit of a player# but as he#s yet to strike a single ball in anger the jury remains quite positively indecisive on that one.However, on the assumption that he does actually play the #great game# his mischievous positioning of pins-when he doesn#t have to try to access them-is causing some consternation and rabble#s babble.Irrespective of the pin positions however, Batman and Robin were at it again as playing companions for yet another highly successful day.Archie Macaskill and John Maclean reprised their excellent performances from round one of the Club Championship last weekend to finish first and second respectively.Off the tee in the second group of the day and having overtaken the trio of old boys in front they were the first players to log their scores and their totals were to remain nonpareil all day long despite a mighty challenge from the large group of competitors.Archie won the trophy and took the honours with  points, his two nines being  and .Going out-of-bounds with his tee shot on the fourth hole was to cost him an  but he immediately secured a birdie  on the very next hole to get him up and running again.Celebrating his th birthday on the course that very day the youngster went on to finish strongly with two more birdies in the final three holes of his round-great stuff and very well done.John Maclean is playing more golf than for many a year as the pandemic has meant that his tourism-related business is closed and is likely to remain so for the time being.But that has allowed him to play more golf, work on his game and slowly but surely his handicap is coming down. shots were required for the first half and  for the second was good enough for  points and also included three birdies so the dynamic duo obviously gel very well on the golf course.Eased out of second place by virtue of the better inward half Lou Gordon nevertheless ed a highly creditable score of pts.Lou navigated the outward half of his round in a miserly  shots and like Archie and John also had three birdies-in the space of five holes. But two lost balls off the th tee unfortunately put paid to his chances of victory.Graham Smith and Ryan Macaskill were the #best of the rest# as they both signed for respectable pts totals # the former easing the latter by….you know the story by now Graham required  blows for his first lap but a sparkling  shots for the second lap with five straight pars to finish showed guts, determination and the promise of things to come Ryan is fairly steady off his  handicap and   was pretty well run of the mill scoring for him. An incident-free round.Honourable mention in this competition for Andrew Long who after a faltering start turned-to in good order slotting four birdies in the run-in, including three birdies in the first four holes of lap two.This weekend the ladies will be competing for the #First Minister#s Quaich# while the gentlemen will play for the #Iain Campbell Memorial Trophy# # in scramble format # on Saturday with a pop-up Bogey competition scheduled for Sunday.On reflection then the golf season on the Isle of Skye is successfully up and running, the course is in excellent trim but still the times are strange.Quite correctly denied the use of the clubhouse to date and sadly for the foreseeable future the club lacks a focal point and with competitors playing with their pals social integration and interaction is exiguous to say the very least.It#s important that we appreciate and enjoy what we#ve got, reflect on what was missing from our lives for the three months of lockdown and just play golf and look forward to a brighter future.:  S Beatson pts .S Dew pts bih  S Jackson pts.: Leading Scores. .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin .

Providing play parks do not get excessively busy and that the guidance is adhered to the level of risk should be low.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council Officers have been working with PlayBoard NI to develop guidance for parents to enable facilities to reopen.Risk assessments have been carried out in accordance with Health  Safety Executive recommendations and research conducted by the UK Play Policy Forum into the impact of Covid- and children’s play.A range of measures aimed at minimising the risk of infection have been agreed and parents and children visiting play parks are asked to adhere to the following guidance:Closed Play ParksIf the play park you wish to use has not yet been officially reopened, please do no attempt to use or access the equipment, and we will get the play park opened as soon as possible.Secured equipmentIn some cases, damaged or broken pieces of play equipment may have been secured to prevent use. If an item has been secured in this manner, do not attempt to remove the temporary barriers or use the equipment.Social DistancingWhen visiting a play park make sure you follow current government guidance on social distancing, encourage and support your children to do the same and keep a safe distance from others not in your household social bubble.Busy Play ParksPlay parks may be busier than usual. If the park you visit is busy, consider coming back at a later time and let your child know in advance that this may be a possibility to avoid disappointment.Hand WashingWash your hands and your children’s hands before and after visiting the play park. Take hand sanitiser with you and ensure you and your child use it frequently whilst in the play park.Waste ManagementMake sure any disposable tissues, PPE equipment etc. are disposed of in the bins provided orone is not available take it home for disposal.Be SensibleIf you or anyone in your household are showing any Coronavirus symptoms, stay home and do not visit the play park.PlayBoard is inviting children aged between  and  to share their views about how Covid- has impacted on their play by taking part in a survey at https:www.surveymonkey r PBYourVoice "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

He was speaking during a visit to a newly established Contact Tracing Centre in Ballymena.The new centre, which opened at the start of the month, is an important part of the wider Test, Trace, Protect programme managed by the Public Health Agency. Speaking during the visit the Health Minister said: “Test, Trace and Protect has a vital role to play in helping us move forward into recovery. This, along with other key public health measures, such as social distancing and ensuring good hand and respiratory hygiene, will help us to reduce community transmission of Covid-.“For Test, Trace and Protect to work, everyone in Northern Ireland must prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and be tested to help protect ourselves, our families and our communities.”The Minister added: “This is likely to become part of everyday le for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccine for Covid- is developed and a vaccination programme delivered.”Olive MacLeod, Interim Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, said: “The initial pilot phase of Covid- contact tracing began in Northern Ireland on  April and as of  May we have been tracing all positive cases. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to have this service established and operational. “Our contact tracing team is made up of trained staff who contact the person who has tested positive identy those people with whom they have had close contact and could be at risk of developing Covid- and in turn contact them to advise them on the appropriate next steps.”Mrs MacLeod concluded: “By this stage most people will be aware of Covid- symptoms which are a high temperature a new, continuous cough or a new loss of or change in sense of smell or taste. But people should also be aware thatthey develop any of these symptoms they should get tested for Covid-.

Measures that were previously regulated by the European Union willto the UK at the end of the year when the transition period expires. Responsibilities in  policy areas - including animal welfare, public procurement rules and environmental regulations - will now go to one or more of the devolved administrations.The way the Government is handling theof powers from Brussels has already provoked a row with Nicola Sturgeon#s administration in Scotland after it was revealed that Whitehall will assume control of the state aid regime. The proposed changes - set out in a white paper being published today for consultation - will see Northern Ireland receive responsibility in  of the  areas, Scotland in  and Wales in . As this could lead to dferent regulatory regimes in the UK the Government has drawn up plans for the internal market to ensure seamless trade between the home nations. At the heart of the plans are the principles of mutual recognition - so regulations in one part of the UK are recognised in all the other nations - and non-discrimination, providing a level playing field for companies across the UK. Officials said that without these actions a Welsh lamb producer could end up unable to sell their meat in Scotland, or Scotch Whisky producers could lose access to supply from English barley farmers. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: This plan is vital to protect jobs and livelihoods across all four nations of the UK. Northern Ireland exports more to the rest of the UK than to all of the EU combined - nearly % of Northern Ireland#s total external trade is with Scotland, Wales and England.We will be enshrining in law the UK Government#s guarantee that Northern Ireland businesses will benefit from unfettered access to the whole UK market. And we will implement the Northern Ireland Protocol in a way which safeguards the effective working of the UK#s internal market.Making sure that seamless domestic trade can continue will support our economic recovery, provide certainty for businesses and create more opportunities for investment across Northern Ireland.Belfast Most ReadUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeSinn Fein calls for parties to condemn torrent of abuse aimed at O’NeillMalachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendNorthern Ireland family#s joy as two sets of twins born during lockdown get to visit grandparents# home,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Whilst my faith may not require me to light a candle for a bereaved loved one or friend, I wouldn#t dismiss lightly that kind of public display or token of concern and thought. Even Christians can sometimes be too stf-upper-lipped to express emotion.Describing himself as a long-time campaigner for the protection of the rights of the unborn, Mr Paisley said it was without doubt the strongest support he has received - both publicly and privately - has been from his Catholic constituents.They are quite happy to tell me that they disagree with many aspects of my politics, he admits. But they say that#s easily put aside when they know I#m fighting faithfully on this matter. To hear them say this - either privately in whispers or more publicly - brings a wave of real encouragement and a sense that I am doing the right thing. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePro-le campaigners on the streets of Belfast have the backing of Ian Paisley FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPro-le campaigners on the streets of Belfast have the backing of Ian PaisleyJust in the last six months, I#ve received over  letters and emails from constituents who are Roman Catholic offering support on this one issue. That cannot be overvalued.He goes on to say that this is in sharp contrast to those who take the same stance in his own faith.As an evangelical Protestant I get tired by the embarrassment some of my faith have in declaring pro-le views, explains Mr Paisley, They say to me: #Yes, Ian, you might think that but you can no longer say it#, or #I agree with you, but we#ve just got to leave it with the Lord and realise we can#t do anything about it#.Frankly, that lack of faith appals me. Maybe it#s because I was brought up by a man of action that I just won#t let go. But I think it#s also the fact that my Roman Catholic constituents want a champion, even when the odds are stacked so decisively against us all on this issue.Stressing that he admires that loyalty and determined spirit, he also singles out anti-abortion campaigner, Bernie Smyth, who heads up Precious Le.She very happily signed my Westminster nomination on the basis of my pro-le credentials. I was moved by the fact that she was publicly happy to nail her colours to the mast, said the MP.Northern Ireland is a small place. That sort of public declaration doesn#t go unnoticed. The local parish priest also wrote to me before the last election. He told me he was openly urging anyone who would listen to him to support me because of these credentials. Then, in a practical way, the community put their money where their mouth is, sending me members to join my campaign team to put literature through doors and talk to constituents about the matter.That reminded me of why I admire my Roman Catholic friends. I am so grateful to them for sharing the same values about the right to le for the most vulnerable.The  piece can be read online at www.catholicheraldBelfast Most ReadUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeSinn Fein calls for parties to condemn torrent of abuse aimed at O’NeillMalachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendNorthern Ireland family#s joy as two sets of twins born during lockdown get to visit grandparents# home,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

Mr Middleton said: ‘‘The restrictions placed on pregnant women and their partners at the height of the first wave of Covid- demonstrated the serious threat posed by the virus and the disruption it caused to even the most cherished aspects of le in Northern Ireland. The guidance that took effect on  July was therefore extremely welcome, once again placing the onus on Trusts to facilitate birth partners seeking to accompany women to a range of maternity appointments. This included, but was not restricted to, dating and anomaly scans, induction of labour, the duration of labour, for birth, and visits to antenatal and postnatal wards. googletag.cmd.push I am becoming increasingly concerned that these rights have not been restored in a consistent or fair fashion. Whilst some Trusts appear to have honoured the guidance in full, the Western Trust have been limiting relaxations to -week scans only. This has led to a perception of a double standard. It is wrong that some birth partners are granted greater access than others simply because of where they live. Every pregnancy and every partner should be treated equitably and fairly. I would urgently call on the Health Minister to take steps to recty these concerns and issue clearer guidance.’’ googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry is a city with a deep-rooted musical heritage and over recent years a superfluity of talent has emerged, each of them dferent, but making their own mark in the industry. Amongst the current crop, you’ve got young established singer-songwriter SOAK, alternative pop artist ROE, the ambient soundscapes of Elma Orkestra, three-piece punk rockers TOUTS, indie folksters Reevah and PORTS, fuzzed up alt-rockers Waldorf  Canon and all female pop-rock courtesy of CHERYM. googletag.cmd.push Then there’s the masterful Our Krypton Son, rockers Wood Burning Savages and resurgent local legends Red Organ Serpent Sound - whose gigs were once described by Eamonn McCann as ‘low instinct, high art and so sexy’ they are ‘reserved sins in certain dioceses’. Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres. This should be released shortly.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Creggan man, who plays for Stoke City, was in the news again this week when he criticised the reaction to sectarian abuse he has faced during his career in England. The Republic of Ireland player spoke out after a number of prominent footballers recently suffered racist abuse. While condemning the abuse,McClean criticised the football authorities, his Irish team-mates and the media over their response to racist and sectarian abuse he has suffered over the years. He is regularly abused for his decision not to wear a poppy. googletag.cmd.push Does one kind of discrimination hold a higher bearing over another act of discrimination  McClean wrote this week on his Facebook page. He has received support fromSinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson who said more needs to be done to support the local footballer. “Its very sad that anyone would have to suffer such anti Irish racism in . I offer my support to James, Erin and their young family, she said. “Racism in any form must be challenged wherever it arises.There is no place for racism in soccer, sport or society. “I would appeal to those with influence within the sporting world to support James and his family. googletag.cmd.push “No person, in any walk of le, should have to suffer racial and sectarian abuse or intimidation. “It has been the case that James has been the subject of a witch-hunt and there has been avery vile campaign of hate against him across many s on social media. It’s totally wrong and shouldn’t be happening. There is a duty on us all to tackle racism and discrimination of any form in our communities and workplaces by challenging negative comments and behaviour.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The survey, which was launched last week, is seeking the views of the public and user groups to help Council plan and understand their requirements when they reopen. By participating in the survey the public will help Council identy the issues that matter to users of its leisure centre and sports facilities. All completed surveys will be entered into a draw with a chance of winning a one month All Inclusive package once the leisure facilities are up and running again. googletag.cmd.push The deadline for completing the survey has been extended to run over the weekend until Monday next. To date over  people have responded. Click here for survey  While all Council owned leisure centres currently remain closed to the public, preparations and arrangements are at an advanced stage to make the facilities safe for a phased and planned reopening. Members of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Communities Committee last week approved a reopening plan and subject to elected members’ approval at Full Council later this month, details of our reopening dates will be confirmed. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council reassured the public that extensive work is taking place at leisure facilities across the Council to welcome the public back to its centres and sports facilities. “It is important to note that Council has to work within the NI Executive’s COVID- guidelines and our staff are workingbehind the scenes to ensure everything is in place to ensure safe workout areas, hygiene and booking facilities whilst maintaining our high standards of service. “Our priority will be to reopen our tier one centres at Foyle Arena and Templemore Sports Complex in Derry, the Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane and the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg in the first instance. We are currently looking at options and safe working practices to facilitate this over the coming weeks. “We anticipate that when we do reopen, it will be with limited capacity, primarily for gym and fitness classes only and with reduced numbers of people. Bookings will need to be made in advance. Some outdoor pitches and courts are currently available for club hire only at this stage and we anticipate that it will be some time yet before we can expand our services to offer swimming and other activities.” The Council spokesperson said that as part of its planning for its phased reopening it will be embarking on a marketing campaign to provide advice, information and reassurance to the public. The public have also been advised that while sports pavilions and pitches remain closed to the public, a booking system is in place to facilitate some outdoor recreation facilities for sports clubs and sporting organisations for training purposes only. The Council has been working proactively with clubs and user groups on this over the past number of weeks and bookings are now being taken. Clubs looking for more information and keen to book the outdoor pitches are urged to fill out an online form Sports clubs can request a booking by sending a booking application form and all required supporting documentation tosportsdevelopment@derrystrabane. “This has been a very challenging time for our leisure centre users and members and we appreciate their patience and understanding at this time. We want to reassure you that the health and safety of the public and our staff are our prime concern and as we plan our phased reopening, it will require their continued patience and co-operation.” Anyone who has any queries regarding their leisure membership are urged to emailmemberships@derrystrabane.

All completed surveys will be entered into a draw with a chance of winning a one month All Inclusive package once the leisure facilities are up and running again. googletag.cmd.push The deadline for completing the survey has been extended to run over the weekend until Monday next.

Click here for survey  While all Council owned leisure centres currently remain closed to the public, preparations and arrangements are at an advanced stage to make the facilities safe for a phased and planned reopening. Members of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Communities Committee last week approved a reopening plan and subject to elected members’ approval at Full Council later this month, details of our reopening dates will be confirmed. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council reassured the public that extensive work is taking place at leisure facilities across the Council to welcome the public back to its centres and sports facilities. “It is important to note that Council has to work within the NI Executive’s COVID- guidelines and our staff are workingbehind the scenes to ensure everything is in place to ensure safe workout areas, hygiene and booking facilities whilst maintaining our high standards of service. “Our priority will be to reopen our tier one centres at Foyle Arena and Templemore Sports Complex in Derry, the Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane and the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg in the first instance. We are currently looking at options and safe working practices to facilitate this over the coming weeks. “We anticipate that when we do reopen, it will be with limited capacity, primarily for gym and fitness classes only and with reduced numbers of people. Bookings will need to be made in advance. Some outdoor pitches and courts are currently available for club hire only at this stage and we anticipate that it will be some time yet before we can expand our services to offer swimming and other activities.” The Council spokesperson said that as part of its planning for its phased reopening it will be embarking on a marketing campaign to provide advice, information and reassurance to the public. The public have also been advised that while sports pavilions and pitches remain closed to the public, a booking system is in place to facilitate some outdoor recreation facilities for sports clubs and sporting organisations for training purposes only. The Council has been working proactively with clubs and user groups on this over the past number of weeks and bookings are now being taken. Clubs looking for more information and keen to book the outdoor pitches are urged to fill out an online form Sports clubs can request a booking by sending a booking application form and all required supporting documentation tosportsdevelopment@derrystrabane. “This has been a very challenging time for our leisure centre users and members and we appreciate their patience and understanding at this time. We want to reassure you that the health and safety of the public and our staff are our prime concern and as we plan our phased reopening, it will require their continued patience and co-operation.” Anyone who has any queries regarding their leisure membership are urged to emailmemberships@derrystrabane.

In the cargo hold, mess halls and exercise areas were also added.Entering service near the end of the war, the Georgetown Victory and  other Victory troopships were given the task of transporting the troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The vessel was operated by the American Export Lines.The ship departed Sydney with , troops steaming to Glasgow, stopping for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal.On April , , just before midnight, the ship ran aground hard, at near top speed,  yards south of Killard Point.All of the servicemen aboard were rescued by leboats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about am.William said local people can remember some men wading ashore through heavy fuel oil from the stricken vessel to be cared for in nearby homes.

They bind communities together, mitigate against isolation and provide something close to an essential service. It is unthinkable that they would be allowed to collapse.Mr OrsquoToole, who is a former Downing Street press officer, says he also favours a tax on the internet giants.ldquoA number of months ago, I wrote to the Executive to ask them to initiate work on my action plan, which includes a rates holiday for local newspapers, prioritising local media in advertising spend, committing to a poundm journalism fund and to press the British Government to institute a digital information levy on social media giants such as Facebook and Google, he said.The MLA added: ldquoI welcomed the opportunity to engage with the finance minister where I pressed upon him the importance of committing to act to save this vital industry.

We had the most beautul Art Deco Vaudeville theatre for celebrities, actors and directors to view their work. So I always loved it and knew I wanted to create something like that when it came todesigning the cinema, explained Jacqueline.Jacqueline reeled in her professional interior design skills, repurposing household items and getting inspiration from the dance showrsquos judgesrsquo table for her home cinema.She said: ldquoTony and I moved back home from London and built our home where we had a basement constructed. But it became a storage area and the kids were sitting more or less in the middle of it.ldquoWe drove up to Belfast and got wadding to line the walls. When we ran out of wadding, we just used old duvets. We covered the wadding with red velvet. That made the room soundproof.ldquoWe are cocooned watching a movie and a massive thunder storm would pass without us even hearing it. Tony did the building work by and the kids helped. We called them the film crew.ldquoI also got gold paint and mixed that with glitter to give the old-style feel of the movie room. We made a bar thatrsquos inspired by the judgesrsquo  table on Strictly Come Dancing. I was watching the show one night and thought Irsquod like to make something like that.The Art Deco-style columns were Billy bookcases from Ikea that we painted. I had a mirror bought for me that needed a place to hang it and we put that in the bar where it really suits. A relative bought us a popcorn machine for added authenticity.She said that from creating the mood board for the project to when it was completed took four weeks, but it really was not used until lockdown.ldquoBefore the Covid- restrictions, the cinema was something we had started and used a bit. When lockdown came and the cinemas closed, the kids were never out of our cinema, she said.ldquoThe kids can go in there and watch their Netflix and Disney Plus mdash we have Sky, Netflix and every other movie and plus channel going now during lockdown so we can get the newly released movies as they are streamed.ldquoNow therersquos so much satisfaction with it.

He was a principled man who helped everyone, regardless of their politics and always stood up for what he believed to be right.A passionate defender of the Ballynahinch electoral area, he lobbied hard to secure investment and was a key player in the drive to secure a new bypass around the market town.Mr Toman made a signicant contribution to the district and a number of organisations, including Loughinisland GAC. He was the clubrsquos former cultural officer and treasurer.Leading the tributes to her friend and former council colleague, Lady Ritchie said the community of Loughinisland and further afield had lost a man of ldquoimmeasurable integrity and the epitome of hard work and resilience.

I can recall Patsy working in that shop and sometimes he delivered our groceries, she recalled.ldquoIn our many conversations, he recalled those visits and how I was only ever interested in the lemonade bottles that were in the grocery box. At that early stage of his le, Patsy was in a hurry and, above all, he was super efficient to get the job done. His attention to detail was legendary.Lady Ritchie said that she next met Mr Toman at a meeting of the SDLPrsquos Down District Executive in Dundrum in June .ldquoPatsy obviously knew who I was because he asked meI was still in Belfast.

He was a member of Ballynahinch Credit Union, Magherlegan Pipe Band, the Monday Club in Drumaness and Loughinisland GAC, as well as numerous organisations associated with the former Down Council. Patsy was a true Gael and was involved in the cultural and Scor activities of his home club.ldquoWhen I worked with the late Eddie McGrady MP, Patsy used to call into the Downpatrick constituency office every Monday and would have met up with the late Cllr Peter Craig.ldquoThere was fierce rivalry between the Saul and Loughinisland GAA teams and those matches were fought out again in the Scotch Street office and latterly in Saul Street, with Patsy and Peter also glorying in the fortunes of the Down GAA team in the early s.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman always put the needs of people first, with this clearly reflected in the background work he did on behalf of the Loughinisland families following the  massacre at The Heights Bar in the village.ldquoPatsy was shaken with emotion and grief about the killing of six innocent men and the images of that night on June  lasted with him until he was overtaken by his illness and his untimely death. He always stood solidly with the families in their fight for justice and truth, she continued.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman was involved in the politics of the SDLP for a long time and was a founder member and chairman of the partyrsquos Drumaness branch.He was elected to Down Council in  and subsequently re-elected in , , ,  and  and while he retired from elected politics in , he remained active in the community.ldquoPatsy was a stalwart on the East Border Region Committee and the Ards Down Rural Partnership, continued Lady Ritchie.ldquoI fought many elections with him and he kept driving everyone to go the extra mile to achieve better representation. AndPatsy had an issue that required a resolution, he pursued you until he got an answer, applying that same approach for all of his constituents.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman had been a ldquotrue, loyal friend for many years and was delighted and honoured to attend his th birthday celebrations in April of last year.ldquoPatsy always confronted you with his political problems which were not major at all. Such was the loyalty and bond between Patsy and myself that whenever I was ill with breast cancer, both he and his we Anne arranged a special Mass for me the day before my surgery. I will never forget that and I am eternally grateful to Patsy and Anne for their personal support to me during my political and personal le, she added.She added: ldquoPatsy was an extremely loyal inidual a family man who cherished his we, children and grandchildren.

In order for staff and guests to enjoy a safe cinema trip, Omniplex have implemented a range of new measures including: * Pre-Booking of tickets – to control the number of patrons in foyers and auditoriums, tickets need to be booked online. * In-Cinema Seat Separation – the system will dynamically lock empty seats around your booking so you can sit next to your friends but will be distanced from others * Limited capacity – they are limiting the number of guests at any time in the foyer and screen capacities will reduce by over % * Enhanced cleaning regimes – including screens and all customer touchpoints. Guests will find sanitisation stations in each of their cinemas * Reduced showtimes – only one movie will start every  minutes to facilitate social distancing and extra cleaning. These policies will be adapted in line with official guidance. Paul John Anderson, director of Omniplex Cinemas said: We’re delighted to be finally re-opening our cinemas over the next few weeks with a selection of popular classic movies. Guests will notice some dferences during their trip like checking in with a host on entry, directional signage and self-scanning of e-tickets. Also, for the first few weeks tickets will also only be sold online so we can limit the number of guests per show”.
