He did not knock at the door, he would just come in through the back door.‘We were in and out of each other’s houses all the time.

These included nine valued at more than £250,000.The most expensive was the construction of a new conservation workshop on the site of the disused mushroom shed in the Home Park area of Windsor Castle, at a cost of £2.2 million, funded by the Royal Collection Trust.A further £1.4 million was spent on a replacement roof to Apartment 1, Kensington Palace - former home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, now occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.Work is expected to start next year on essential maintenance to the East Wing, which will see around 10,000 Royal Collection items decanted elsewhere. The Sovereign Grant for 2018-19 will be £82.2 million - a core of £49.3 million, plus an additional £32.9 million for resurfacing the palace.

The most expensive form of royal travel, mile for mile, is the royal train which costs approximately £20,000 per journey. Charles took seven journeys on it, which has sumptuous sleeping and dining cars.He also billed taxpayers £15,385 to charter a plane for a private day trip to London from Birkhall, his estate in Scotland. Aides declined to explain the reason but admitted there was no official engagement, saying royals were ‘allowed to travel from residence to residence’.The public paid £18,170 for Prince William to join the Passchendaele centenary commemoration in Belgium last July – and a further £30,414 to hire a separate private plane for Prince Charles to go too. Aides said the two princes were travelling from different starting points in Britain and following different programmes in Belgium.          Prince William flies privately internally in a country, but takes commercial planes to fly abroad, costing a lot less than his father The rise in Charles’s travel bill is in part down to the fact that, as heir to the throne, he is undertaking more travel on behalf of the Queen, who has stepped down from foreign tours in view of her age.The Prince of Wales derives most of his money from the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate of mainly farmland and residential property that was set up to provide a private income for the heir to the throne and his family. His income from the Duchy rose by 4.9 per cent to £21.7million last year, while he also got £1.2million from the Sovereign Grant from the Government. The prince paid £4.8million in tax, which he does voluntarily, a rise of 2 per cent on the previous year.           Prince Andrew, Duke of York, Queen Elizabeth II, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge stand on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during Trooping The ColourYesterday officials said an incredible 10,000 precious artworks would have to be removed before the builders arrive in April.Some of the paintings, vases, tapestries and antiques will be loaned to galleries and museums around the country and the world.But others will be placed into commercial storage during the duration of the works.All 10,000 items are under the care of the Royal Collection, which has launched a massive operation to find them all temporary homes.          10,000 items are under the care of the Royal Collection, which has launched a massive operation to find them all temporary homesThe Chinese Dining Room, Yellow Drawing Room and lavish bedrooms used during state visits will all be pulled apart during the renovations - the biggest works at the palace since the aftermath of the Second World War.Leaky water pipes and dangerous old wiring behind the walls and beneath the floors all need fixing. Some 10 miles of pipes, 6,500 electrical sockets and 152 antique toilets will be replaced.The Duke of York’s private apartment will be affected by the works and he will have to move elsewhere in the palace. The Princess Royal, who also lives there, already has a second apartment at nearby St James’s Palace.Yesterday a senior courtier said it was hoped the works would not prevent the royals accessing the balcony for Trooping of the Colour next year, but admitted there was a doubt, saying: ‘It will be assessed. It needs to be safe.’ Another aide said: ‘We will be able to provide more details in the autumn, but the expectation is that it will be very much business as usual.’ He added the works were internal and there would not be any scaffolding on the outside of Buckingham Palace.

The Suri are a self-conscious and culturally proud people. They take part in a form of stick fighting called saginé or \u0027ceremonial duelling\u0027. It serves as a rite of passage for male youngsters and brings great prestige to men - it is especially important when seeking a bride - and they are very competitive, at the risk of serious injury and occasional death          Cattle are also enormously important to the Suri, as owning herds boosts status.

However, Canada Day is not the same as the day of Canadian independence.Although Canada as we know it first began to form through the 1867 act, it was still part of the British Empire, slowly splitting off throughout the early 20th century joining the League of Nations as an independent country in 1920.Total sovereignty was only achieved in 1982, when the UK Parliament moved the power to change Canada’s constitution to the Canadian government via the Canada Act.When is Canada Day?Canada Day marks the enactment of the Constitution Act, which was on July 1, 1867 and is thus held on that day every year.However, if July 1 falls on the Sunday, then Canada Day will instead be celebrated on July 2.

Valerie Castile has since founded the Philando Castile Relief Foundation, which helps victims of gun violence.Since her son’s funeral, Castile had amassed hundreds of artworks in her Minneapolis home, from painted portraits of her late son to drawings, sculptures and tapestries. The artworks were gifts from the local community to help the family grieve and heal.“She wanted to do an exhibition to show her gratitude for all of the artists who have been giving her artwork since her son was fatally shot,” said Nicole Soukup, the assistant contemporary art curator at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. “This exhibition is about a painful, isive tragedy which shows how the community responded in ways that speaks more to than just what words can do alone.”The artwork is now on view as part of Art and Healing: In the Moment, which opened last week at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, where 15 artworks by local artists are on view until 29 July. “It encourages our audience to think about this moment in society in a deeper way,” she adds.When Soukup visited Castile’s home, she was taken back by the amount of artwork she saw. “I was totally surprised by the outpouring of support that the community had been showing her,” she adds. “After discussions with the Castile family, we were able to make an exhibition about art and healing in the moments after this really tragic event.”Castile’s death was livestreamed on Facebook two summers ago by his fiancé Diamond Reynolds, who said she recorded the video for fear of her own life. It went viral, sparking a resistance movement against racially-charged police brutality, building on the Black Lives Matter movement. The police officer who killed Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, was found not guilty of manslaughter.When Soukup visited Castile’s home, she spotted over 30 artworks hanging salon-style in her living room, “but I know she has hundreds,” she adds. “The art was stacked up against the walls, cluttering the hallway and in boxes throughout the house.”There are paintings on canvas, drawings, prints and letters, but that’s not including murals, site-specific art or protest placard artworks made the years after.The 15 works in the exhibition were selected by Castile, Soukup and the institute’s community advisory panel. “It was clear we needed to create something that wasn’t overwhelming, it was already so moving emotionally,” said Soukup. “We wanted to create pacing, quiet moments alongside these emotional works of art.”There is a sculpture of a ceramic broken heart by Angie Renee called Why, which includes typewritten-style text on a heart. “She created this heart before Castile’s death, but when she heard the news of Castile, she felt like she had to rip it apart,” said Soukup. “It speaks to a lot of the urgency of how the art was created, it expressed how people dealt with it.”There’s also a video called I.am.Mural by Xiaolu Wang, which traces the making of a resistance mural about Castile’s death, which was painted on a building that has since been demolished. It was painted by 12 artists in the local community as a response to the police brutality, which read in part: “Straight up HD evidence didn’t matter, the truth is our lives do matter.”There is also a portrait of Castile in the show by artist Leslie Barlow, who painted him in oil on tissue paper, with his face slightly obscured. “The artist wanted to soften the image, not to hide it in shame but it’s a reliquary of someone who died who is veiled,” said Soukup.Much of the art is coming from the community who knew Castile personally, or knew of him, as he was a nutritionist working in the cafeteria of the JJ Hill Montessori magnet school. “The incident had a resounding impact of the community,” said Soukup. “The artwork comes from every corner of the city.”There is also an abstract quilt with geometric patterns in yellow, green and orange, in the exhibition. It was created by textile artist and quilter Aisha Masakella, who inscribed the back with the phrase: “In remembrance of Philando Castile, as a gift to Valerie Castile, may you find comfort in this quilt.”“She had someone suggest to her in 2016 to make a quilt to honor Castile, and though it took her over a year to make this quilt, she did it,” said Soukup. “It speaks to the artist on what it means being African American today.”The fatal shooting of Castile has left an undeniable mark on the city and will continue to do so for a long time. “People look at their own community in a new light,” said Soukup. “The artwork speaks volumes, and it’s all dedicated to Valerie Castile, how she is not alone, the artists feel her, see her and hear her in these moments. In that way, it’s quite powerful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/110444af80e663efd2a1c68e4a0f10c586fd1ca3/0_373_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c321ac78a32993690376ae313be4ff59","title":"tina barney best photograph picasso at my sisters wedding party","story":"‘A Picasso on the wall, a redhead whose hair matches the wooden panelling, an angel lamp echoing the bride’s dress – what a palette!’My sister Jill has been in many of my photographs, but this is the one-in-a-million shot. I took it on her wedding day in 1985. After the ceremony, which was held in a church in Manhattan, we went back to our aunt’s apartment on Park Avenue. When I was a child, my aunt would have us all over for Christmas dinner, so her home was very much a part of our family, although I hadn’t been there for a long time.The reception was an intimate affair, maybe 50 people, mostly family. It wasn’t loud. There was no music. My aunt was older. It was fairly staid, formal even, although Jill might remember things differently. My most salient memory of that day was that she married the most perfect person you could ever find. We were all very happy.This was a candid shot. There was no time to think about anything, barely time to focus. I don’t even remember if I asked Jill, who is wearing the gold dress, to stand up. And while that is an important Picasso on the wall – Angel Fernandez de Soto, from 1903 – I hadn’t intended to shoot it. Jill just happened to be sitting in front of it.I wasn’t really intending anything much. First of all, this was a party and I was a guest. And I didn’t have assistants. I was just walking around with my camera on a tripod, the flash on top, carrying some film holders between my legs or something. I do remember asking Andrea, the woman with the red hair, to turn. And I probably told my half-brother Paul: “Look at Jill.” But it all happened in seconds. The flash froze that stare on Jill’s face just as she got up.Look closely and you’ll see the similarities between her and the angel in the lamp directly behind her: the clasped hands the legs rendered visible by the flash the dress itself, a golden lamé masterpiece by Arnold Scaasi and the way Jill’s headdress melds with the floral arrangements behind to mimic the angel’s halo.There were further coincidences: the three apples in the painting on the right, echoing the three figures and that fortuitous slit going up the back of Andrea’s dress, breaking what would have otherwise been a very solid rectangle of white in the foreground. The whole palette! I mean, how about finding a redhead whose hair matches the walls?I know Jill’s face well, having photographed her so often. We are only 13 months apart, almost like twins, except that we’re so different. She is as uninhibited as I am controlled, and she has always had great style. I can’t remember if I showed her the pictures after her wedding. My family weren’t all that interested in my photography. I think they just thought: “Oh, here comes Tina again with her camera.” They were happy I was doing something, but I could have been a lawyer or a doctor or something. They certainly weren’t sitting there anxiously waiting to see the results. Actually, I don’t think I’ve ever had anybody anxious to see my pictures, probably because I rarely shoot anyone obviously self-conscious or vain. Which is not to say that shooting the wedding wasn’t scary. It was very scary – because I had such high expectations. I still do. Just recently, I photographed a woman who had appeared in several of my works from long ago. I hadn’t seen her in 30 years. The dreams and hopes I had for that image! You just never know if those dreams are going to come true.Training: Sun Valley Center for the Arts , Idaho.High point: “Having a solo show at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1990.”Low point: “Having rotator cuff surgery on my shoulder, which meant I was unable to photograph.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/381c53c9aae7a0678b9b1de7c5ecdfdc397f88cd/0_0_3172_3958/master/3172.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=aa9a0d1556941f7047941d133df343d5 1400w","title":"deliveroo couriers win six figure payout in employment rights case","story":"Riders claimed they had been unlawfully denied minimum wage and paid holidayA group of 50 Deliveroo couriers will share a six-figure payout from the takeaway delivery firm in a settlement of an employment rights claim.The riders, who were represented by the law firm Leigh Day, argued that they had been unlawfully denied rights, including the legal minimum wage and paid holiday, after being labelled self-employed contractors.The case was to be the latest in a string of similar employment rights claims, against Hermes, Uber, Addison Lee, City Sprint, Excel and eCourier, which have that ruled gig economy drivers and couriers have “worker” status with more rights than independent contractors.Annie Powell, a solicitor in Leigh Day’s employment department who represented the riders, said: “Deliveroo has paid out a material sum to settle these claims. In our view, this shows that Deliveroo knew that they were very likely to lose at the employment tribunal. “This settlement will make a real difference to our clients’ lives. Some of the riders we represented were on the breadline, earning hundreds and in some cases thousands of pounds below the national minimum wage over the time that they worked for Deliveroo.”Powell called on the company to change its practice and implement a compensation scheme for all riders on similar contracts.Deliveroo said it was pleased to have reached the settlement, which was first reported by Sky News, without an admission of liability.A spokesperson for the London-based firm said: “This settlement has no impact on Deliveroo riders or our model and allows us to continue to focus on creating the well-paid, flexible work that our riders value. Courts have repeatedly considered Deliveroo’s model and judged that riders working with us are self-employed.”The settlement of the case, which was due to be heard by an employment tribunal in mid-July, comes after the high court backed a decision by the central arbitration committee, which considers union recognition cases, that Deliveroo riders were self-employed contractors.The committee concluded that because riders were able to pass on a job to a substitute, they were not obliged to provide a “personal service” and therefore could not be classified as workers.However, the high court gave the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain permission to launch a full judicial review of the workers’ rights to collective bargaining based on human rights grounds. Deliveroo’s hiring conditions are also to be scrutinised by MPs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce2d6f10db7c7f3840797fc7b9d8eeb0621b6544/0_0_4610_2766/master/4610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22d6e1b3ee1094bfbc44bd224497f323","title":"germany fan london world cup","story":"The shame-walk home in my Germany shirt was pure schadenfreude – but you English won’t have the last laughSo that was disorientating. Germany bottled it, exited the World Cup. And I had to watch it happen in the heartland of football failure, a country where the years of hurt now number 52.Watching the World Cup as a German in London is to experience an emotional rollercoaster involving fear, hope and schadenfreude. I’m still slightly wary of leaving the house in my Germany shirt, and was seriously considering flying back if we met England in the later rounds. The prospect of staying in London to watch the English lose to us on penalties yet again seemed a bit too intimidating.Those reflections now seem to belong to a slightly different era.As the former coach Jürgen Klinsmann once famously said: “When Germans have achieved something big, they try to achieve again with less effort.” That didn’t go so well. After the defeats against Mexico and South Korea, I had to shame-walk the streets of London in my Germany shirt after finally being brave enough to sport it in public for the first time after four years in the UK. Perhaps I jinxed it.Luckily I live in south-east London, among fellow immigrants, so the reactions were better than expected. Apart from a few evil looks from some builders, who I couldn’t clearly identify as English, people were actually rather compassionate. My workmates – big shoutout to Syria and Argentina! – tried to cheer me up, and one of the less hostile guys from the construction site agreed with me that we might need a new coach, as I returned from work.So we’re out, and Lineker’s maxim no longer applies. “Football is a simple game,” said Gary Lineker after England were knocked out by Germany in the semi-finals at Italia ’90. “Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes, and at the end the Germans always win.”Well, quite. But you English should beware hubris. During Euro 2016, I noticed that the English usually talk up their squad to dangerous levels before an international tournament, as they’re usually very decent on paper and win a few absolutely pointless friendlies. Meaningless victories at group stage then induce a state of national euphoria – see beating Panama 6-1. After that, a cataclysmic event such as losing to Iceland normally comes along, and the country plunges into a bout of sarcastic self-deprecation and ticks off another year on the calendar of hurt. Don’t count on it not happening again.Anyway, believe it or not, even though I am German, I too have known dark football times in the past – for example the European Championships of 2000, when Germany were knocked out at the group stage, finishing below England (also knocked out). However, I admit that after the successful recent years, and Löw being able to leave world-class talent such as Leroy Sané at home, I was confident that we wouldn’t have to experience such humiliation again anytime soon.As we all know since yesterday, things went somewhat against expectations. Not picking our only outstanding dribbler (Sané) didn’t turn out to be such a great idea, considering we were expecting three teams in our group who would park the bus. The Erdoğan scandal wasn’t helpful either, but only played a minor role in this one-act play of German football arrogance.• Oliver Imhof is a freelance journalist based in London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c2568f4ddb7f3c5cd7682aea2356f56ea733080/0_184_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3767fa71e5cb7c4e00af594fe6489014","title":"royal family finances day transparency press","story":"Its annual day of openness is a step towards much-needed transparency, but most of the royal press pack is elsewhereIt’s hailed as the one day in the year when members of the royal family come clean about their finances. At the end of June, the palace regularly opens up its books to public scrutiny when it publishes not just the report on how much the royal household has spent but also the financial results of the Duchy of Cornwall and the Crown Estate. In a year when the disclosure of the Queen’s and Prince Charles’s investments in offshore tax havens has been met with a deafening silence from their officials, a loosening of lips was long overdue.Thursday’s disclosures show that the Queen is doing very nicely from her taxpayer-funded sovereign grant, which rose to £76m last year and will go up to £82m in the current year. Some of this money is allocated for the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, which will cost us all an eye-watering £369m over the next decade. Some of the costs could be clawed back if Buckingham Palace were opened up more to the paying public – as happens with the Swedish royal family’s palace in Stockholm, which welcomes visitors all year round. Yet the UK family has so far failed to do so.Prince Charles is in the money, too. His income from his private estate, the Duchy of Cornwall, is expected to rise in 2017-18 to a record £22m. He also gets another £1m or so from the public purse to pay for his travel costs.Transport has long been the royal family’s Achilles heel. A single visit last year by the Prince of Wales to India, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore cost a staggering £362,000. It’s partly down to his air fare. The prince might need expensive, non-scheduled flights on RAF planes for security reasons, but costs could be kept down if he had a smaller entourage. For shorter trips, scheduled flights should be given greater consideration.We also learned that he has increased the amount of his Duchy money going to William and Harry from £3.5m to £4.9m a year. Most of this sum (which also includes some capital spending) is allocated for their public duties, but because we are given no breakdown it is unclear how much is used for personal spending. And now Harry has a new bride, we still do not know how much extra money will go on expenditure for Meghan.So far there has been no word from the prince’s spokespeople on whether, after the embarrassing revelations in the Paradise Papers about the Duchy of Cornwall’s offshore investments, there are any plans to change how his foreign holdings are overseen, or if they will be made more transparent.There are two other odd things in Thursday’s announcements that work against proper scrutiny. First the choice of date. The announcement coincided with Prince William’s Middle East tour, which meant that most of the royal press pack were abroad rather than at Buckingham Palace and Clarence House – and were thus unable to cast an expert eye over the accounts. Was this deliberate? There were certainly mutterings from some royal correspondents that the announcement should have been rescheduled, although the palace maintained that the date could not be changed because the reports had to be passed to parliament.Second, there is the question of bringing out three financial reports on a single day. Reporters and analysts received a mountain of data, which had to be quickly processed. To cynical eyes, this looks like the palace managing the message: they take a single hit on a single day, rather than having a succession of bad press days.To be fair, the palace is more forthcoming with its financial information than in the past, and this one day of openness is a step in the right direction. But wouldn’t it be healthier if this happened all year round?• David McClure is the author of Royal Legacy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c7494cb48233b67e1da92d4215b1204e004994/458_64_2542_1525/master/2542.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4521d50e27b10aa96fa3db8a980bb3b5","title":"the guardian view on an anglican cover up the church that didnt want to know","story":"It’s not the scandal that does the damage, they say, but the cover-up. What happens if the cover-up is itself covered up? This is the question that the Church\u0026nbspof England must face with the publication of an\u0026nbspextraordinary report into the occasion, eight years ago, when it gave itself a pass mark on the issue of sexual\u0026nbspabuse. A report then published, prompted by scandals earlier in the decade, was meant to measure the extent of historic sexual abuse known to the church.\u0026nbspInstead it produced the frankly incredible claim\u0026nbspthat there were only 13 cases in 30 years that had\u0026nbspnot been dealt with properly.Now that Peter Ball, a former bishop of Lewes and of Gloucester, has been convicted of indecent assault and been sentenced to 32 months in jail, while Lord Carey, who as archbishop of Canterbury attempted to rehabilitate him and suppressed some of the evidence against him, has been barred from working as a priest in retirement, it is time to review the church’s earlier self-examination. The Ball case is only the most visible of what is now obviously a considerable load of past cases. The archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, along with two of his bishops, has been formally reported to the police for alleged inaction over the case of one of their priests who was as a young man raped by an older priest.When the house of bishops first discussed the matter, in 2007, one bishop objected that “the real victims could include those clergy and church officials about whom unfounded allegations had been made”. On the other hand, something would have to be seen to be done: “It was noted … that a failure to proceed might be taken as evidence of a church culture which colluded with child abuse.” Perish the thought. In the event, those parts of the church that wanted to collude continued to do so. Seven bishops sent in no reports whatsoever: none are named in the report, although the church has since named their dioceses. All have now retired. In keeping with this general aversion to reality, a decision was made early on to examine only files of cases, and not to talk to any survivors, on the grounds that to do so might be traumatic for them. None were asked if they would feel better for being ignored. The files were much easier to deal with, in part because they were haphazardly stored, in some cases in garages, and of varying age and completeness. Some records, says the report, referred merely to “an unfortunate saga” or “past difficulties”. “The state of many files does generate a risk that safeguarding concerns were not recognised as such,” writes Sir Roger in a magnificent understatement.In the end, despite these hazards, nearly 50 lost cases were sent in for consideration from the diocese of Chichester alone (and there are 43 more dioceses). The compilers of the original report whittled these down to 13 for the whole country. It is difficult to understand how Sir Roger could be confident that there was no massaging of the figures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db40a2c49cf42492e706e5ac5ba54d7e6210742c/45_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=955941ec2f35cf80c5bc31b08aec31a7","title":"tories tawdry jostling theresa may brexit","story":"The coincidence is uncanny: as Theresa May sits down to dinner tonight in Brussels, England battle Belgium on the football pitch. But the leaders facing burgeoning EU crises will talk little about Brexit, an afterthought over the petits fours. Beyond admonishing her for offering no plan, what can they do but shrug?She arrives yet again unable to explain the inexplicable: how can Britain have no plausible proposal after two long years? She will promise that miraculously, in 10 days’ time, after her Chequers cabinet away-day, she will have a final plan, agreed and united: why would they believe that?Rolling their eyes, they will ask why that cabinet meeting was not fixed before today’s summit, long described as “crucial”? After two wasted years, the EU warns that there are in effect only six working weeks left for negotiation before the October summit and signing of a final agreement. The cabinet ate my homework, she may plead, as she sits there helplessly with no authority to propose anything. Schadenfreude at Angela Merkel’s own weakness will be her only small sour solace – but, unlike the World Cup, a weaker Germany is no help.All cabinets are dysfunctional in their own way. Cameron was forced into his fateful referendum to purge the Eurosceptic disease. The BlairBrown schism was a pointlessly destructive cabinet feud, signifying nothing. Major was brought down by the same kind of “bastards” that wrought the current woe. Thatcher was eventually knifed by her “vegetables”. Harold Wilson, his cabinet split on the EU referendum, dangled over the Bennite v Jenkinsite ravine. Yet governments got things done despite internal ructions.This time is different. With no Brexit agreement, everything else in May’s government is paralysed. Maybe she never meant those words anyway, but nothing has progressed her opening decree about “burning injustices” and the “just about managing”.The great Euro-schism gifted the keys to No 10 to this most inept leader: her impossible task was always to heal it, and now Chequers is billed as that last chance. But the disgraceful behaviour of her cabinet suggests a party too wildly out of control, too intoxicated with rebellion and personal vanities to whip back into coherent government.Battle lines along the Euro-split were inevitable. But this is not two orderly battalions facing off for the final conflict, but a rabble of deplorables elbowing each other for the top job. For non-Tories, the spectacle should be an uproarious delight, a comedy of absurdities, as each “look at me!” contender looks more preposterous than the last. But one of them might win – and these are dangerous times.Liz Truss returned to her Britannia Unchained theme in a clumsy leadership bid this week, calling for rapid deregulation of everything, and attacking Gove for his tiny environmental curbs on straws and wood-burning stoves. Remember, she’s the one who wanted child-minders so deregulated they should each care for six toddlers single-handed. Priti Patel, another author, not to be outdone, just attacked her party as unmeritocratic, signalling her own humble background. And the less said about Gavin Williamson, the better.When Boris Johnson said “fuck business”, Jeremy Hunt suddenly realised he was being left behind and jumped in with his own ludicrous admonition to businesses such as Airbus to stop making “inappropriate … threats”. The party of business is dead and industry despairs, because for now, Brexit fantasies still beat the fatal facts, which risk bearing down too late.Others, too, rush to join this rogues’ gallery of ambitious fools and self-promoters, outbidding one another for Brexit zealotry. What makes them so despicable is that Brexit is just a tool in their leadership bid, not a war of ideas and ideals but mere power jockeying. May has lost control and the lower she sinks, the harder they compete for her job. The real damage done to their party is this: to win the leadership they have to be raving Brexiters and illiberal rightwingers. But to win a future general election, the new leader must swivel 180 degrees, as Cameron did, to pretend to be modern, compassionate, green, huggy and anything but nasty.Imagine the EU leaders gazing down the table tonight at Theresa May, observing the rowdy rabble behind her who refuse to agree on anything. Why take her seriously, unless she can bring a serious Brexit proposition that conforms to the EU rules the UK helped draw up? Until then, should they laugh or cry? The Tory party in such shameless disarray is deeply damaging to us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6af6e680d24ee6fb1c2f0142cf64d6845b1fc795/0_87_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc7052214e363e00bbb95a336b64f4a5","title":"student loan interest rates rpi retail prices index inflation","story":"House of Commons analysis leads Labour to accuse Tories of ‘rigging’ interest ratesGraduates with student loans in England are saddled with up to £16,000 more debt because of the government’s use of an unreliable inflation measure to set interest rates, according to research from the House of Commons library.The analysis, provided to Labour’s shadow Treasury team, shows that the use of the retail prices index (RPI), a measure criticised by the Bank of England and the Office for National Statistics, adds the most interest to the debt of the lowest-paid graduates.While the Bank of England’s target inflation rate is the consumer prices index (CPI), the student loan interest rate is linked to the older RPI, which has recently run at a higher rate than the CPI.“The Conservatives are rigging interest rates to ramp up costs for students. It’s not enough that they’ve saddled graduates with an average of £50,000 in debt, they’re now charging an additional £16,000 on their loans,” said Peter Dowd, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.The figures are likely to increase the pressure for student loan interest rates to be overhauled when the government’s independent panel on post-18 education and funding issues its report later this year.The analysis comes as new forecasts from the Department for Education show that student loans of all types in England are likely to hit £15bn in 2017-18, in part because of the ending of maintenance grants and nursing bursaries. The DfE’s forecasts also show student loan outlays hitting £20bn a year by 2022-23, despite a predicted fall in student numbers.“The majority of this forecast increase is as a result of several changes made to the student loans policy by government,” the DfE analysis notes.“In particular maintenance grants were replaced with maintenance loans for new entrants from academic year 2016-17, and new nursing, midwifery and most allied health entrants from 2017-18 became eligible for student loans for financial support in place of receiving NHS bursaries.”Labour will be keen to return to the attack over student loans, with Dowd reiterating his party’s pledge to abolish tuition fees and calling for CPI to replace RPI on existing loans.The House of Commons analysis finds that switching to CPI would result in £16,000 less interest being added over 30 years to the debt of graduates who never earn above £25,000 a year, and similar amounts for other lower-earning graduates.Dowd pointed out that in 2011 the government dropped RPI in favour of CPI for uprating public sector pensions. “The government is cherry-picking inflation measures to maximise profits. They’ve used one measure to cut workers’ pensions and another to drive up student debt, simultaneously robbing the old and the young,” he said. Meanwhile, students leaving university appear to be finding it easier to win graduate-level jobs.

And they argue that the bill shouldn’t be handed just to nation states, but corporations too. Let’s be honest, the global community’s response to the rising evidence of mass extinction and ecological degradation has been largely to throw crumbs at it. Where we have acted it’s been in a mostly haphazard and modest way — a protected area here, a conservation program there, a few new laws, and a pinch of funding. The problem is such actions — while laudable and important — in no way match the scope and size of the problem where all markers indicate that life on Earth continues to slide into the dustbin. But a few scientists are beginning to call for more ambition — much more — and they want to see it enshrined in a new global agreement similar to the Paris Climate Accord. They also say that the bill shouldn’t just fall on nations, but the private sector too. In 2016, E.O. Wilson — arguably the world’s most lauded living evolutionary biologist — published a book called Half Earth where he proposed that to save life on Earth (and ourselves) we must set aside around half the planet in various types of reserves. Not surprisingly, the idea was immediately controversial — but it was also picked up by other scientists hungry for an ambitious, hopeful way of facing a future of ecological Armageddon. Last year, 49 scientists wrote a landmark paper exploring how feasible Half Earth might be across Earth’s different terrestrial ecosystems. But the head-line news of this paper was really this sentence: “We propose a Global Deal for Nature — a companion to the Paris Climate Deal — to promote increased habitat protection and restoration, national — and ecoregion — scale conservation strategies, and the empowerment of indigenous peoples to protect their sovereign lands.”In less technical parlance, this is a ringing call for a massive, global agreement that would look at drastically increasing the amount of the world covered by parks — in some cases up to the Half Earth goal — and indigenous protected areas. Indigenous people are now widely recognized as some of the best defenders of nature after decades of being sidelined. This new agreement, they authors contend, should embrace the Half Earth — or Nature Needs Half — goal.“A number of empirical studies are telling us that we need to set aside about half of the terrestrial and marine realms to avoid the worst of the two great environmental catastrophes — climate change and the sixth extinction crisis — looming on the horizon,“ Eric Dinerstein, the lead author on the paper, said. Previously with WWF, Dinerstein is today the Director WildTech and the Bioersity and Wildlife Solutions Program with the NGO, RESOLVE.Such an agreement would likely fall under the United Nation’s Convention on Biological Diversity, first established in 1992, as an international treaty. Today, the CBD meets every two years. In 2010, the nations of the CBD agreed to something called the Aichi Bioersity Targets, these are 20 goals that nations are supposed to be working towards by 2020. We’ve pretty much failed to meet the majority the targets, including halving habitat loss and deforestation, sustainably managing fisheries, preventing the extinction of known endangered species, and minimizing the impact of climate change on coral reefs.But we are close on one of the targets: setting aside 17 percent of land area under protected areas and ten percent of marine and coastal areas. Currently, 15 percent of land area is protected (though much of this lies in so called ‘paper parks’ which suffer from a dearth in funding) and about 8 percent of the oceans. The CBD has had a number of disadvantages. For one, much like the Paris Agreement, it’s non-binding and largely voluntary. This has been a necessary concession in order to get so many nations sign on — just like with Paris — but it also means there’s no legal way to enforce action. Just international peer pressure. For another it’s lacking a major signatory. Guess who? Yes, of course, the United States — that global black sheep. The non-binding treaty was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, but was never ratified by Congress. Every other nation in the world is a member of the agreement however.Finally, the CBD has not been able to garner the same kind of media attention and interest as the various climate change declarations. For some reason, an agreement about the fate of millions of species on Earth just hasn’t grabbed our attention-deficit media. But these drawbacks need not ensure that the CBD be toothless or ineffectual. And if there’s a time for it to prove its mettle, it’s now. Since the Aichi Targets expires in 2020, the CBD needs something to replace it. And it looks likely that the idea of Half Earth will be discussed. The Executive Secretary of the CBD, Dr. Cristiana Pașca Palmer, recently told the  in April that a new agreement should include a proposal to make half the planet more nature-friendly by 2050. This is not quite Half Earth — which envisions half the planet under various types of protection — it does, however, offer a significant ratcheting up of ambition compared to the Aichi Targets committed to ten years ago.The former Minister for Environment, Waters and Forests in Romania, Pașca Palmer says bioersity is the “infrastructure” that keeps our planet going. “In my view, we need to ensure that the entire planet is used sustainably,” she said in an interview. But this, according to Pașca Palmer, will require a wholesale change in our economy operates.“We need to...shift to an economic model that accounts for the fact that we operate within a closed system – planet Earth – and that our economic growth is limited by the ecological limits of the planet”Arguably, the largest element holding back greater conservation action worldwide is funding. To date, the money is simply magnitudes less of what is actually required. “As with any public good, bioersity conservation suffers from a free-riding problem, in which governments have an incentive to provide less than the optimal level of funding in the hope that others will cover the costs,” said Edward Barbier, an economist with Colorado State University, adding, “the current global bioersity crisis is in large part due to the lack of international commitment and funding over the past 25 years.”Barbier is a lead author on a new paper suggesting a novel way to ratchet up funds for the other eight million-plus species on the planet. “It will take around $100 billion a year to protect the earth’s broad range of animal and plant species, and current funding fluctuates around $4-10 billion annually,” he said, illustrating the massive shortfall for global conservation. In order to raise $100 billion a year — ten times more than is currently spent in the very least — Barbier argues we can’t just depend on governments but must turn to the private sector. He and his co-authors argue a any new agreement through the CBD should create a mechanism that would allow private corporations to join with their own targets and funding goals. But what would compel corporations to sign on?“Corporations depend on the health of our eco-systems and are therefore at risk of losing the very foundations upon which their businesses rely,” explained Thomas Dean, co-author of the paper and sustainable develop professor at Colorado State University. ”Growing awareness of this challenge will increasingly motivate corporations to engage.”The paper points to industries where bioersity is vital to their bottom line such as fisheries, forestry, agriculture and insurance. “For too long we have viewed corporate and environmental interests as adversarial. However they need to become aligned if we are to be successful both economically and environmentally,” Dean said. “After all, this is the fundamental purpose of an economic system — serving the needs of society in the short and long term.”But is protecting 50 percent of the world even possible? Let’s put it this way: it’s not impossible. Dinerstein’s study last year found that of the 846 ecoregions on land, over ten percent of them already have attained fifty percent protection. Moreover a number of countries — including Namibia, Bhutan and Venezuela — are close to fifty percent protection on land. Dinerstein says that conservationists will have to get creative to reach such an ambitious target, but he believes it can be done. “We will have to include semi-intact areas, managed areas, areas under indigenous protection, and probably about 7-10 percent restoration of key areas…The key here is to be strategic and protect the most irreplaceable sites first over the next decade and fill in the rest over the coming years.”This doesn’t mean every ecoregion can hit the 50 percent target. Some — think the tallgrass prairies of the US — have no chance. Indeed, the study found that 207 of the world’s ecoregions have less than four percent habitat left. Dinerstein says getting to 50 percent in these areas is “delusional” but aiming for 10-15 percent in such habitats via restoration would be a starting place. Such an endeavor would go a long way towards solving another global environmental crisis: climate change. Preserving and restoring forests and other habitats has long been touted as one of the quickest and cheapest ways of decreasing global carbon emissions. Around 15 percent of global CO2 emissions today are directly tied to forests being chopped down, peatlands drained or mangroves cleared. Of course, the biggest hurdle is likely to be political — as it was, and continues to be, with combating climate change. Will proponents be able to convince the world that Half Earth would be a positive — and inspiring — way to create a better more ecologically stable world? “It is certainly a major challenge, as has been the case with the Paris Climate Accord. But we need to start somewhere,” Dean said. If all this sounds like utopian fiction, Dinerstein pointed to the fact that Chinese scientists have already published a paper on how they could hit 50 percent protected land in one of the most populous countries on Earth. “Nature Needs Half is the biggest idea out there,” Dinerstein said, “and the only one that could guarantee a future for all life on Earth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a4e2c76422c86185c41edac6bc8a0a69eae7b17/866_0_2418_1451/master/2418.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65b939511f48ea5f87700244324e4de5","title":"incredibles 2 feminism animation","story":"With Elastigirl taking centre stage, the new Pixar film’s feminist cape is streaming proudly. But the wider animation industry needs to catch upBrie Larson is the latest Hollywood actor to call for a greater gender balance in film criticism – yet when the US reviews for Incredibles 2 emerged after its 15 June release, voices were overwhelmingly male. Not only that, but some were so focused on their arousal at Elastigirl’s shapely form, they failed to spot – or at least comment upon – the fact that the film is a feminist triumph.As a female film critic watching Incredibles 2, I was thrilled to see an animation that bucked tired gender cliches even more than the first film had. The plot that sees Mrs Helen ParrElastigirl (voiced by Holly Hunter) going to work while her husband looks after the kids isn’t a simple case of role reversal: it’s an act of sisterhood. When rich benefactor Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) starts a plan to bring back banned superheroes, it’s his tech-savvy sister Evelyn Deavor (Catherine Keener) who crunches the numbers and states that Mrs Incredible is the best person for the world-saving job – she’s statistically less liable to cause havoc and more likely to get results. “Heavyweight problems need heavyweight solutions,” bristles Elastigirl’s bulky husband (Craig T Nelson), unaccustomed to having his status challenged – but, like Winston, he complies. Disney-Pixar’s latest film shows signs of taking this on board, and not just when it comes to Helen and her superhero daughter, Violet (Sarah Vowell). We also see the return of successful costume designer Edna Mode (voiced by the film’s writer-director Brad Bird) while a key figure is a female ambassador (Isabella Rossellini), who is presented without comment on her gender. She happens to have grey hair, as do an unusual number of the women in the film – and they are far from hobbling grannies. Cast your mind back to action movies where there are gatherings of influential people in a glamorous location, say at a mayoral opening or a party on a yacht. Chances are – animated or otherwise – these will be dominated by sharp-suited men and a few younger women in tight dresses, a distinctly Weinstein flavour. I couldn’t help wondering if Incredibles 2 was consciously trying to avoid this trope, despite being in the planning many years before the #MeToo campaign. Disney has shown an increasing commitment to family-friendly feminism in recent years: such films as Maleficent and Frozen aren’t simply happy accidents.Might the Weinstein scandal finally have called Time’s Up to unconscious gender bias in animations as well as live action? Marge Dean, president of Women in Animation, says: “The landscape is changing rapidly. There has been movement for the last 50 years, but when the sexual harassment in Hollywood came to fore and there were consequences to male bad behaviour, everything shifted. People started listening to women and believing them. This has empowered women to speak up more.” Pixar itself felt the full force of this, with its co-founder and chief creative officer John Lasseter stepping down after allegations of misconduct.Predictably enough, and despite its record-breaking box-office results in the US, Incredibles 2 has faced a social media backlash. (As if anticipating this, an early scene sees Violet’s schoolmate stating that he’s not intimated by strong girls – because he’s pretty “secure”.) Some US punters remained unamused. @JonWest56 wrote on Twitter: “Tried to relive my childhood by seeing Incredibles 2 yesterday. The movie would have been fine if there wasn’t an agenda. Very modern feminist movie. Leave politics out of cartoons and children’s movies. Bad enough it’s all you hear now, but kids movies?!? COME ON”It’s shocking to think that audiences have been so conditioned that they see a reflection of current, real-world gender dynamics as “political” – especially as Mr Incredible and his two sons see plenty of action, too. This complaint echoes the territorial war cries surrounding the all-female Ghostbusters, and the toxic male Star Wars fans who trolled anyone who supported the fact that The Last Jedi had interesting female characters. But the Twitter naysayers may have to get used to it: there’s been a gradual shift towards complex female characters at the centre of animated movies – and very successful ones.While feisty young heroines – Princess Merida in Brave, Riley Andersen in Inside Out, Moana, Finding Dory – are becoming more common in the Disney-Pixar universe, Incredibles 2 is unusual in offering older, urbane, complicated female characters. In one of several Bechdel test-passing scenes in Incredibles 2, Helen and Evelyn share a drink in what looks like whisky glasses (again, when did you last see that?) and talk about gender dynamics in the workplace, discussing the “man’s world”. I found it quietly groundbreaking: it offered hope that a generation of young girls would be able to envisage a complex working future, albeit with less dramatic moral challenges than those faced by Helen Parr. But while it might pass the Bechdel test, Incredibles 2 doesn’t pass on all counts. Having crunched the numbers, Dr Natalie Wreyford, research fellow on the Calling the Shots project at the University of Southampton, says: “Incredibles 2 has three named male characters for every named female character. One of those women is voiced by a man, and another is only heard off-screen – nagging!” She also points to the gender ratio in the film crew. “There is a difference between paying lip service to equality, and having a woman’s perspective on the world. Incredibles 2 has more than 10 men working in the animation department for every woman. That’s a huge imbalance. The director is a man, and most of the key roles are held by men.” This holds true for most animated films. “Animation is still a profession dominated by men, despite there being more female than male animation students. These men do not have a very good track record of including women on screen, or even letting them speak when they are on screen – the male characters in Frozen, for example, have more lines than the women, despite Elsa and Anna being the leads.” The recent female-directed Japanese anime Maquia improved on this and proved the naysayers – who claimed that women film-makers were too “realistic” for fantasy animation – categorically wrong.There is good news on this front: Jennifer Lee, the co-director of Frozen, was recently hired as one of Lasseter’s replacements as the new chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios. “It marks an important moment in the visibility of women within American animation,” says Dr Christopher Holliday, an animation expert at King’s College London, “and a real chance for the industry to find a new set of female voices.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f43c5167eb192bf9a92c58d5657e4716874990b/0_3_1814_1088/master/1814.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c033629961bbd9c63b612d5116c1ea03","title":"vertigo is not the last word in misogyny but a feminist deconstruction of it","story":"‘Farfetched nonsense,” said the New Yorker. “The film’s first half is too slow and too long,” said Variety. When Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo was released in 1958, the critics were by no means all negative – “One of the most fascinating love stories ever filmed,” said The Hollywood Reporter – but, for the most part, the response was lukewarm. “A plot structure of egg-shell thinness,” wrote Penelope Houston in Sight \u0026amp Sound.Fifty-four years later, Vertigo took over from Citizen Kane at the top of a Sight \u0026amp Sound poll of the greatest films of all time and now, 60 years after its original release, the film’s status seems assured. The plot of Vertigo has more holes than a pair of fishnets, which can be off-putting on a first viewing. But, as with many great films, the story is little more than a skeleton on which to drape all the other, more interesting elements that you begin to see once you can look beyond the villain’s insanely convoluted modus operandi, the protagonist’s unfeasible gullibility and all the other “flaws” that make this the most magnificent, preposterous thriller of them all.Vertigo was adapted from the 1954 novel D’Entre les Morts (Among the Dead) by French crime-writing duo Boileau-Narcejac, whose credits also included the screenplay for Georges Franju’s classic horror movie Eyes Without a Face (1960), as well as the novel on which Henri-Georges Clouzot based Les Diaboliques (1955), the mother of all dark thrillers with shocking twists, which Hitchcock had, not surprisingly, admired. Set in Paris during the second world war, the book was influenced by another novel, Bruges-la-Morte, Georges Rodenbach’s 1892 masterpiece of Belgian symbolism, in which a grieving widower falls for a dancer who resembles his dead wife and (spoiler!) ends up strangling her with a lock of the dead woman’s hair.Hitchcock and his screenwriters (Alec Coppel and Samuel A Taylor) transposed the story of D’Entre les Morts to San Francisco and changed the ending, but otherwise preserved its main thrust. James Stewart plays Scottie, an ex-detective with acrophobia (fear of heights), who is hired by an old acquaintance to keep an eye on his wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak), whose odd, morbid behaviour has been giving him cause for concern. Scottie becomes obsessed with the woman he is stalking. After his phobia prevents him from saving her when she leaps to her death, he is inconsolable ... until he meets Judy, who bears a vague resemblance to Madeleine, and tries to recreate his lost love by dressing her in the same clothes.If, in some quarters, Hitchcock and his films are still considered the last word in misogynistic creepiness, Vertigo is exhibit No 1. “Look how strong and stable the male characters are,” says one critic (I’m paraphrasing, but not by much), while describing the female characters as simultaneously “unhinged, duplicitous and submissive puppets” – which would be quite a feat if it were true.While Scottie is Vertigo’s protagonist, his point of view is unambiguously delusional. There are only brief flashes from the female characters’ perspectives, but they are as clear-eyed as Scottie’s own vision is blinkered, and are as essential to the story’s poignancy as the women watch helplessly while he rejects the real world and spirals down into necrophilia. Judy loves him, but he is not interested in her – he just wants to remould her into the spitting image of his fantasy woman. She reluctantly capitulates, but was there ever a line as heartbreaking as: “If I do what you tell me, will you love me?”As for dear sweet Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes), Scottie’s friend and ex-fiancee – has there ever been a woman who watched Vertigo without identifying with her, even just a little bit? She’s clever, funny, down-to-earth and selflessly supportive, but what use are these attributes when the man she loves has no sense of humour or self-awareness, and prefers instead to lose himself in an ethereal, flaky fantasy of womanhood?It is not hard to find claims that Hitchcock’s female characters are blond and bad and deserve to die. “The sexual fantasies of his adult life were lavish and peculiar, and, from the evidence of his films, he enjoyed devising the rape and murder of women,” Peter Ackroyd wrote in Alfred Hitchcock: A Brief Life. “They all get punished in the end,” Bidisha wrote in a  article about Hitchcock’s women. “They were blond. They were icy and remote,” wrote Roger Ebert. “Sooner or later, every Hitchcock woman was humiliated.”And not for the first time, I wonder if I have been watching the same films as these other writers. Hitchcock himself didn’t help matters by colluding in his own mythology with statements that seemed designed to provoke. “I always believe in following the advice of the playwright Sardou. He said: ‘Torture the women!’ ... The trouble today is that we don’t torment women enough.”Of course, the film for which Hitchcock is best known – and which has inevitably coloured the popular view of him – is Psycho (1960), in which the blond heroine (Janet Leigh) commits a crime and pays the ultimate price at a disconcertingly early stage in the narrative. And one should not overlook his reprehensible treatment of Tippi Hedren, for whom he developed an unrequited erotic obsession while shooting The Birds (1963) and Marnie (1964), resulting in the sort of abuse that would rightly call down the wrath of today’s #MeToo movement.But just for a moment, let us consider Hitchcock’s women – all his women, not just the ones played by Novak, Leigh and Hedren. At all stages of his career, he surrounded himself with strong female collaborators such as his wife Alma (whose contributions to his work should never be underestimated), Joan Harrison (secretary, screenwriter and producer), Peggy Robertson (script supervisor and assistant) and Suzanne Gauthier (personal secretary).And for a so-called misogynist, his films feature a lot of intrepid heroines. Think of sharpshooting Jill Lawrence in The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934), feisty Erica Burgoyne in Young and Innocent (1937), Iris Henderson rejecting attempts to gaslight her in The Lady Vanishes (1938), Mary Yellen tackling a gang of wreckers in Jamaica Inn (1939), Charlie Newton realising there’s more to her beloved Uncle Charlie than meets the eye in Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Dr Constance Petersen treating her patient and solving the mystery in Spellbound (1945), Eve Gill sleuthing in disguise in Stage Fright (1950), Jo McKenna singing Que Sera, Sera as a child-locating device in Hitchcock’s own remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956).Even when the women are nominally just love interests, they are unusually plucky and quick-witted. Take Pamela in The 39 Steps (1935), Carol Fisher in Foreign Correspondent (1940), Pat Martin in Saboteur (1942) and – above all – Lisa Fremont in Rear Window (1954), who proves she is more than just a vision of pulchritude in a perfect little day dress by breaking into the murderer’s apartment to snoop around. In all the rooms across the courtyard, Rear Window lays out the various stages of sexual relationships for the benefit of its commitment-phobic male voyeur, but marriage in Hitchcock’s films is rarely a happy-ever-after ending, more often the prelude to a woman’s struggle for survival in films such as Rebecca (1940), Suspicion (1941) and Notorious (1946).The monstrous mothers of Hitchcock’s films are often cited as another proof of his misogyny. Yet no one ever seems to question Hollywood’s perennial obsession with father issues. And why should mothers be self-effacing and weak? Besides, Mrs Bates in Psycho exists only as a figment of her son’s imagination, and Alexander Sebastian’s mother in Notorious is – from her point of view – entirely correct to be suspicious of his new wife, who is a spy. And offsetting the monstrous mothers or domineering housekeepers (Mrs Danvers in Rebecca, or Milly, hiding shrunken heads in Henrietta Flusky’s bed in Under Capricorn, 1949) there are always benign, dotty but delightfully unconventional – and both played by Jessie Royce Landis – Jessie Stevens in To Catch a Thief (1955) and Clara Thornhill in North by Northwest (1959). “You gentlemen aren’t really trying to kill my son, are you?”As for Vertigo, it mercilessly scrutinises romantic love while swooning over it. That giant redwood, Bernard Herrmann’s music, that dizzying dolly and zoom. The film doesn’t just reflect Hitchcock’s own attempts to control his leading ladies, but suggests how contemporary notions of romance have themselves been shaped by Hollywood movies. It is not an example of misogyny, but an overblown, beautiful and tragic deconstruction of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d14580079ec492b336ba6539d00ceaee888cee92/76_125_3319_1992/master/3319.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f1833538d29572c8baf81bb904afc80","title":"when you watch your country play in the world cup who do you watch with","story":"If you’re a fan of the World Cup and have friends and family over to watch your country play, we’d like to hear from you With the World Cup fast approaching, we’d like to hear from families and or groups of friends living all over the UK watching their home country play.

Japan, however, only accumulated four bookings compared to Senegal’s six, and that – the Fairplay rule – ended up being the deciding factor on a day when Poland signed off their miserable World Cup finals with a win.It was a strange game in so many respects and finished with Japan, aware of the scoreline in Samara, playing a game of keep-ball deep inside their own half, desperate not to concede again or pick up any more bookings. Many in the crowd made their feelings known by whistling in disgust, yet Japan were not bothered in the slightest. Their players performed a lap of honour at the end and can now look forward to a place in the last 16 for only the third time in their history. As for Poland, Jan Bednarek’s second-half winner will provide small comfort from a tournament in which they were a huge disappointment.It was uncomfortably humid in Volgograd, with the temperature hitting 38C in a stadium where bottles of water were scattered around the perimeter of the pitch to give the players some respite from the unforgiving conditions. The game itself was something of a slowburner, however, and although Japan carried the greater attacking threat for much of the first half, it was Poland who came closest to scoring during that period.Just after the half-hour mark, Kamil Grosicki met Bartosz Bereszynski’s right-wing cross, following some fine work from Rafal Kurzawa in the buildup, with a twisting header from 12 yards that was drifting towards the far corner. Stretching every sinew to get across his goal, Eiji Kawashima managed to claw the ball out with his right hand. The Japan goalkeeper ended up in the back of the net but the ball just about stayed out – part of it was over the line but not all.It was an impressive save from Kawashima, whose place in the team had come under scrutiny after he was at fault for goals in the games against Colombia and Senegal. Although Nishino kept faith with Kawashima, the Japan manager made a number of curious selection decisions, including leaving out Shinji Kagawa, their talisman, Makoto Hasebe, the captain, and Takashi Inui, who has arguably been their best players at these finals.Generally, though, it was Japan who looked the more menacing up to the interval. Shinji Okazaki’s ing header, from Yuto Nagatomo’s left-wing cross, flashed past the near post in the 13th minute and moments later Yoshinori Muto saw his low drive repelled by Lukasz Fabianski at the near post. Fabianski, who replaced Wojciech Szczesny in goal and was one of five changes to the Poland team, made another decent stop when he beat away Takashi Usami’s angled shot.The problem for Poland was often the final ball – Grosicki overhit a pass that would have left Piotr Zielinski clean through on goal – yet Kurzawa found his range with a lovely flighted free-kick from left to right that exposed some awful marking in the Japan defence. Hiroki Sakai, Gotoku Sakai and Yuya Osako all stood and watched as Bednarek, on the edge of the six-yard box, side-footed home a powerful right-footed volley that gave Kawashima no chance.Inui, finally, was introduced midway through the second half but it was Poland, with the game now stretched, who should have scored again. Grosicki broke down the Poland right and this time executed his centre perfectly, picking out Lewandowski, who ought to have registered his first World Cup goal. Instead, in a moment that summed up his tournament, the Bayern Munich striker lifted his shot over the bar. What a blessing for Japan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9323670d4ae72bfb85cfb584442a296fa5ede8dc/578_195_2422_1453/master/2422.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed9fc10d81d222a6ec394a8c1289ef40","title":"joachim low cannot survive germany world cup humilation","story":"The most amazing thing about Germany’s World Cup exit at the group stage is that the sun still rose this morning. You wouldn’t have thought so on Wednesday evening. Anyone who was walking the streets of Berlin kept staring into the empty faces of people trudging zombie-like to the next tube station and felt like an extra in some post-apocalyptic drama.One can understand why those fans were shell-shocked. If you count the Confederations Cup as a big tournament, Germany had reached eight semi-finals at major events in a row since 2005. Quite apart from the fact nobody has ever achieved anything remotely like this before – not even one of the many fine Brazilian teams in history, not even the Germans themselves previously – it lulled the country into a sense of security that turned out to be very false indeed.Make no mistake, there had been warning signs before the national team left for Russia. Not the fitness debate surrounding some players, most notably Manuel Neuer. That was par for the course, as Germany always go into a World Cup haunted by injury worries. No, it’s rather that a strange mood had engulfed the team in the weeks before the tournament.The preparation matches were sluggish, like the group games that followed. Then there was the debate triggered by Mesut Özil’s and Ilkay Gündogan’s meeting with the Turkish President Recep Erdogan. It was shocking to hear German fans booing German internationals. It clearly got under Gündogan’s skin and while Özil outwardly remained his inscrutable self, we can assume he was shaken as well.Finally, there were reports about two camps in the squad the established players who won the World Cup and the hungry youngsters who lifted the Confederations Cup. The rift was probably not as deep as some observers claimed, but everybody could see that there was a world of difference between players who were hungry and eager to prove themselves – think Marco Reus and Julian Brandt – and most of the veterans.For the first time, either as assistant or head coach, Joachim Löw failed to create team spirit, traditionally the side’s biggest strength. Löw must have sensed it, because this concern was probably why he did not call up Bayern Munich striker Sandro Wagner and cut Manchester City’s Leroy Sané from the squad. Two players with a bit of an ego.Even the fans seemed unprepared for the tournament. There were far fewer Germany flags on display than we have become used to since the 2006 World Cup. One theory says the rise of the political right has reintroduced scepticism about the use of national symbols. Another points towards a growing disillusionment with football in general, epitomised by all those fan protests during the Bundesliga season just past. Personally, I think the fans were just like the players – tired.So, what now?First, Löw has to step down. No, this is not a populist call for heads to roll, I’m merely stating the obvious. Actually, there are many good reasons why he should stay on, starting with the fact that his only logical successor is unlikely to leave Anfield any time soon. But the unwritten rule says our national coach has to resign if the team is knocked out in the quarter-finals of a tournament. Löw would probably have been the first Germany manager to break this, and may even have kept his job if the team had been eliminated in the round of 16 by the likes of Brazil. But the group stage? No way.The national team is an institution like Volkswagen, or one of the major parties. And of course Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned in the wake of the emissions scandal, stating: “I am doing this in the interests of the company even though I am not aware of any wrong doing on my part.” And, of course, a party leader steps down after an awful election result, simply because it’s his responsibility.Also, there is really no alternative. To stay with the political analogy – if Löw decides to continue he’ll be a sitting duck, pretty much like Social Democrat Martin Schulz, who opted not to resign after his party’s September 2017 election debacle. But of course his public standing was so damaged that he belatedly threw in the towel five months after the historic defeat.But a new national manager won’t be enough. Another reason why Germany’s early exit wasn’t totally unexpected was the fact the recent European club seasons were a disaster for the Bundesliga. Since the 2014 World Cup, only four German clubs have reached the quarter-finals of the Europa League and not one made the semis.There will be calls for a radical rethinking – and that usually means an attack on the 50+1 rule (which prevents our clubs from being owned or controlled by iniduals or companies). However, for anyone who cares about the national team, this would be the worst possible scenario. All examples from abroad indicate that deep-pocketed investors are not interested in grooming homegrown talent, as this takes time and is hardly glamorous. Provided those investors who are supposedly waiting to sink large amounts of cash into our clubs do really exist, their money is going buy expensive foreign stars who will relegate German talents to the bench.So we have to continue on the path we have chosen – but we should also ask the one question that is truly worrying. It is a question not only raised by the performance of the team in Russia but also by the fact that Borussia Dortmund, widely lauded for their youth movement, had only one player in Germany’s World Cup squad as the talent the club nurtures tends to be foreign: Christian Pulisic, Ousmane Dembélé, Jadon Sancho.The question is: did we win the 2014 World Cup because our famous Talent Development Programme worked a treat and produced amazing players, or did we simply luck into one golden generation and now have to wait until the hand of fate deals us the next?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f98d99a68ddc07d3fe80d070957aa72ddcc84b/0_54_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b94f672a4303af3aee12b8458cc43c22","title":"senegal colombia world cup group h match report","story":"It was the moment that Colombia had prayed for and when it came the release of emotion was overwhelming. South America’s second most populous nation needed a win to make sure of their place in the last\u0026nbsp16, even though a draw would have sufficed because of Poland’s surprise 1-0 win against Japan.Colombia wanted to make sure themselves and they did so when Yerry Mina rose to meet Juan Quintero’s corner in the 74th minute. When the towering centre-half gets up in such positions, the alarm bells ring loudly and just as he had done in Colombia’s restorative 3-0 victory against Poland in the previous game, he thumped home the header.The result, coupled with that in the other Group\u0026nbspH tie meant Colombia advance as winners of the section. The delight was evident with all of José Pekerman’s players, who performed a team dance routine after the goal while, up in the stands, their great former midfielder Carlos Valderrama led the celebrations.It was a tempestuous occasion, framed by noise and colour, but the on-field spectacle failed to keep up. There was minimal goalmouth action, with Colombia mustering only two efforts on target. Senegal had three. But the outcome was all that mattered to Los Cafeteros, who had to contend with the loss of their marquee player, James Rodríquez, to injury after 31 minutes.Poor Senegal. They controlled the first half and their performance was framed by sound tactics, organisation and aggressive pressing – together with speed on the counterattack. On the other hand, they laboured to create clear-cut chances, messing up a clutch of promising situations.The roof fell in on them after Mina’s goal and in the end they were squeezed into third place and out of the competition on yellow cards accumulated, having finished level with Japan on points, goal difference and goals scored. Two bookings was the difference. None of Africa’s five representatives will feature in the knockout rounds.Senegal had been determined to emulate their only previous showing at a World Cup – the quarter-final finish from 2002. Instead, they would make an unwanted piece of history. They are the first team to be eliminated from the World Cup on fair play criteria.From the start the stadium was swathed in bright yellow – it was a Colombian takeover – and the din was deafening from first to last, although there was a gasp and silence on 17 minutes when Senegal thought they had a penalty.The referee, Milorad Mazic, pointed to the spot, after Davinson Sánchez jumped into a challenge on Sadio Mané, even if the decision looked harsh in real time. Enter VAR and it became apparent that although the Colombia defender might have brushed Mané’s shin first, he clearly took the ball. To the immense relief of the South Americans, the referee reversed the ruling.Aliou Cissé had started with Mané up front alongside the powerful and direct Mbaye Niang in a 4-4-2 formation and the movement of both strikers caused problems. Mané looked to have the beating of his markers, especially Mina, and it was an uncomfortable first half for Colombia, although Senegal failed to work the goalkeeper, David Ospina.Colombia could point to a 12th‑minute free-kick from Quintero that bounced awkwardly in front of Khadim Ndiaye, forcing the goalkeeper to push around a post, but they were disjointed for long periods.It was a big blow for Colombia to lose Rodríguez. The attacking midfielder had carried a calf injury into the tournament and he did not look fit. He touched the ball\u0026nbsponly 15 times and when he slumped to the turf, it was in obvious frustration. Pekerman was not clear on the extent of the injury but he declared himself to be “extremely concerned”. He added: “It’s a topic that could overshadow everything.”Poland have been one of the disappointments of the World Cup and yet there was a crescendo of noise from the Colombia support around the hour mark, when the news of a goal for the Poles against Japan filtered through. Suddenly Colombia were in a position to qualify, although to rely on Poland was not a sound idea. At the start, Senegal had been primed to finish top of the group and only needed a draw to qualify.Pekerman’s players were more assertive in the second half as they began to gain a foothold higher up the pitch. Rodríguez’s replacement, Luis Muriel, saw a shot blocked by Kalidou Koulibaly and he was beaten to a through ball by the advancing Ndiaye before Mina got away from Cheikhou Kouyaté to score.Senegal stared at disaster and they rallied. It was breathless stuff. Niang rolled Mina and shot only for Ospina to save – it was a big moment – and the goalkeeper also got down to stop a corner that deflected off Mina. Ismaila Sarr also fluffed a volley when well-placed. The pain would belong to Senegal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/892c0cbc103c30b24729d89d7467ecc5118a4f4f/0_43_1336_802/master/1336.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=976d98fc4d462070a83fc7aad0a47458","title":"argentina germany adapting adversity world cup liam rosenior","story":"In life it can be known as the moment of truth but in football it is the moment of adversity. It is the moment when as a team you find yourselves trying to cope with pressure, bad performances and even off-field problems which have combined to jeopardise your continued participation in the world’s greatest football tournament. You know that how you react will define your opportunity to lift the World Cup and become part of history.This week Germany and Argentina stared into the abyss of impending failure when adversity struck both sides much earlier in the tournament than expected. In the case of the South American team, I guarantee the relief, euphoria and joy they felt when Marcos Rojo fired the winning goal against Nigeria will make them psychologically stronger, more confident and fearless in the next game against France. This is the benefit in both facing extreme adversity and pressure from back home and having the knowledge that a major obstacle has already been hurdled, galvanising the group and strengthening them mentally.I feel Argentina are still a major threat in this World Cup. Problems in tournament football can actually be a good thing if a solution is found in time, something that Argentina have done, changing Jorge Sampaoli’s aggressive high-press game with three central defenders for a more conservative, conventional back four. It gives them a solid basis from which the pace of Ángel Di María, the probing passing of Éver Banega and the genius of Lionel Messi can flourish in forward areas.A lot has been made of who is actually making the coaching decisions within the Argentina camp but as long as everyone is on the same page and the players are open, honest and respectful in discussions with the coach, having a collaborative approach to tactical problems can encourage accountability, decision-making and group unity on the pitch. This will improve both team performance and dynamic in the future. The fact is the group saw something was not working, faced the challenges head on and tried to adapt, resulting in a much-improved performance against Nigeria than in their previous game against Croatia.Argentina’s adversity may make them an even tougher team to face in the later rounds and I have a feeling that they will overcome France on Saturday. Conversely, France have cruised through without having the scrutiny and difficulties that Argentina have had to overcome. They have played within themselves at a low tempo and question marks remain about whether they will be able to turn it on under pressure against an Argentina side who, even with the greatest footballer on the planet, will still be classed as underdogs and have nothing to lose.And then there’s Germany. Despite their reputation for finding solutions, they did not adapt or solve the problems they encountered in their first match against Mexico, instead continuing with their tactical plan of expansive full-backs without the necessary cover from midfield to protect them from counterattacks. This left them open against Sweden and ultimately led to them crashing out of the group against South Korea.I think many of us in the UK were amazed at Joachim Löw’s decision to leave Leroy Sané at home but that act points to something deeper within the Germany camp. Look at the reaction of supporters towards Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan after they were pictured with the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and then the public criticism by Mats Hummels of the performance in the Mexico game, which indicated that when adversity hit the group they were not unified or equipped psychologically to deal with it. They didn’t adapt or counter the problems that were clear in their first two games, basing their hopes on the quality of their players and the proud history of German teams in qualifying from the group phase rather than tackling their tactical deficiencies head-on. Compare this way of working with Argentina, who were humble enough to change and adapt to keep their World Cup dreams alive.In England the theory of coaching our next generation of players is based on a “growth mindset” – embracing problems and finding practical solutions – rather than a “fixed mindset” – relying on natural ability and previous history to overcome a problem. It is more and more being identified as the best way to help players to be mentally strong enough to make decisions,and be accountable and adaptable on the field of play.On the face of it you would think that this England group have had a smooth ride in the tournament so far but being clawed back in the first game by Tunisia and responding well would have been a huge psychological boost , especially the players who were facing their first pressure moment in a World Cup. The team continued to have faith in the way they were playing patient, high-quality technical football, did not panic and smash long hopeful balls into the box, and finally scored a deserved last-minute winner. They could easily have folded but didn’t and this was very encouraging for tackling the problems and challenges that will inevitably arise later in the tournament.Gareth Southgate, in the way he has picked his squad based on performance, is open to dialogue in all areas with his players and has challenged his group with a different tactical system and embraced openness between his players and the media, which has completely changed the culture and perception of our squad. I’m confident it will equip them well and they will be more than ready when the dreaded moment of adversity comes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edbdb547f4cc6af9b872c6dbc95bcff035d78a8a/562_778_4175_2505/master/4175.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08b80549fc274691dadbaa5d505aca8d","title":"lionel messi argentina france world cup","story":"A lot of the talk at this World Cup has been about big teams underperforming and, believe me, I know all about that. In 2002 we went into the first World Cup in Asia as reigning champions and we had also added the European crown in 2000, playing better football and with more confidence in our ability. France turned up in South Korea with Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet and Djibril Cissé – the top scorers in England, Italy and France if my memory serves me well. We were the overwhelming favourites and no one who looked at our group – Senegal (making their World Cup debut), Uruguay and Denmark – imagined we would have any trouble finishing top. And yet we left that tournament after three games, without scoring a goal. One of the biggest flops in World Cup history.In our defence, our star player – the incomparable Zinedine Zidane – got injured in a warm-up game and could only come back, not fully fit, for the third match. But by then we had already blown it. If you have forgotten – and these are painful memories for those of us who played these games, believe me – we lost the opening game to Senegal, 1-0. It was a huge surprise, maybe one of the biggest in the tournament’s history. A bad day at the office, it happens. But what was striking was the way that defeat affected us. We were the world champions but just that one defeat made us suddenly question everything.I was the captain and I sensed we had a problem after that Senegal game. We had several meetings among the players to try to clear the air, get back that confidence, work out what had gone wrong. But I was amazed at how quickly we lost it. Maybe it was the pressure of being the title holders and the fear of losing everything. You have a stature to defend and suddenly you fear losing it all, you lose that assurance.You wonder if it’s the end of a cycle and before you know it, it is. To win a second World Cup is super tough – just look at Spain in 2014 and Germany in Russia, like us knocked out in the group phase. It’s a bit like a tennis player struggling to finish off a match, the hands shaking at match point. In football that fear can creep in and overtake you.With Argentina, one of the other pre-tournament favourites, I think things are different. For me it’s very painful to talk about the problems Argentina are facing because it means having to criticise Lionel Messi. He’s supposed to show the world that he can carry his national team to victory. But he missed the penalty against Iceland that could have given his team a much-needed victory and, although his goal against Nigeria was magnificent, Argentina were only five minutes from being eliminated from this World Cup.We know Messi is great but we’re confused and sad for him. He is such a pure Barcelona product but with Argentina right now Messi’s in a mess. Something is missing – is it unity, faith? Messi doesn’t seem to fit into the collective. They have so many talented strikers, so many skilful attacking players and yet they don’t seem to know how to get the best out of them. They are really struggling. Is it the system? Is there a certain spirit missing?Argentina cannot keep blaming the pressure of living up to Diego Maradona’s generation – they have had plenty of time to get used to that and they have top players performing in some of the best clubs in the world. Pressure is something these guys are used to.Going into the last game in last place, behind Iceland, was just unimaginable for Argentina fans. But maybe it’s not that surprising. This team struggled to qualify for the World Cup and of course they got thrashed 6-1 by Spain not long ago – even though Messi was not on the field that night. It is possible to make a slow start and still win it – look at Spain in 2010, beaten by Switzerland in their first match but world champions a few weeks later. But somehow that scenario looks unlikely for Argentina.I can recall Argentina’s 1978 victory at their World Cup – one of my first football memories. Some great players such as Mario Kempes, Osvaldo Ardiles and then of course Jorge Burruchaga, Jorge Valdano and Maradona for the 1986 side. Today, though, you have to say they are not a good team. If you’ve watched their three games you know what they’ve shown so far means you can’t include them in the top five or six.In that respect you could say it’s good for France to have to play Argentina for a place in the quarter-finals rather than Croatia, who have impressed and looked full of confidence. The problem, though, for me as a France supporter is that maybe their last-gasp qualification will inject a belief into this Argentina squad. You expect them to show something different now. And let’s face it, France have yet to show anything to make us feel optimistic, to give us hope.But then I really do feel that this France team have more to give. I think they will be capable of raising their game and they will have to, if they want to overcome the Argentinians. Until now France have had to play teams who do not want the ball, teams who want to defend. But our team is more at ease against good footballing sides, we have players who can play really well on the counterattack and maybe we are not ready yet to control games. I’m really looking forward to Saturday’s game.A quick word on England, who at least have shown they are capable of scoring goals at this World Cup. People say it was only Panama but you can only beat the team in front of you – it’s not England’s fault the opposition was weak. England’s form suggests there is a future for this team. Is the future going to be at this World Cup or rather Euro 2020?Let me finish with a word about Panama, though. I’m not like those who moan about having little teams at these competitions – for me that’s what the World Cup is all about. Sure, the team let in six goals against England and had a style of defending set pieces that would not have looked out of place on a wrestling mat, but just look at the joy created by their goal!How can you not smile when you see all those Panama fans dancing and singing after that goal by Felipe Baloy? Don’t you just want to be part of that? For me, that’s what the World Cup is all about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63bcb5ad7278596b7d72c7c6eeb138242b9f75a9/686_92_2656_1594/master/2656.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50a1e252b4f5d7347483bfceb03ff85a","title":"wayne rooney england great dc united everton manchester united england","story":"Wayne Rooney, without the fanfare that greeted his arrival as the most gifted English player in a generation or the acrimony of his first Everton exit, has brought his 16-year Premier League career to a close. Even so, and even with all eyes on Gareth Southgate’s new breed in Russia, it is a career that does not slip away unheralded.Rooney, with Everton’s blessing and encouragement, flew on Thursday to Washington to finalise a three-and-a-half-year contract with DC United. The deal will be formally completed when the MLS transfer window opens on 10 July – Everton will not receive a fee – and the 32-year-old is expected to make his debut for the Eastern Conference’s bottom club when they open their £300m Audi Field stadium against Vancouver Whitecaps four days later. His basic wage will be around £75,000 a week, half the amount he received at Everton, albeit with greater commercial opportunities to soften the blow. It is a decision reached with careful consideration and some reluctance.The former England and Manchester United captain signed a two-year contract with Everton when he returned to his boyhood club last summer, the club having the option on a third year. Rooney rejected more lucrative offers from China (which he has again this summer) to fulfil an ambition that his sons should see him play for the club that they, he and his own father support. He did not envisage another brief spell at Goodison at the time but a new era where his experience and leadership would be valued before possibly moving into a coaching role.“They have been at a sort of standstill for the last 10 years but now they are pushing forward,” the striker said at his Everton unveiling alongside the then manager, Ronald Koeman. “They want to be winning trophies again and I want to be part of that.” Best-laid plans. In hindsight, the standstill was superior to Everton’s chaotic regression under Koeman, the caretaker David Unsworth and Sam Allardyce last season.How best to utilise Rooney’s ageing talent was a problem for all three Everton managers but it would be wrong to dismiss his return as a sentimental mistake. The striker finished as the team’s leading scorer on 11 goals and delivered several highlights in a miserable season, including the opening-day winner against Stoke City, the immaculate 57-yard finish in a hat-trick against West Ham United and a derby equaliser from the spot at Anfield. Not scoring against Liverpool in his earlier spell at Everton had been one of Rooney’s deepest regrets. It was another box ticked in a hugely rewarding career, albeit a minor one compared with the five Premier League titles, one Champions League, one Europa League, one FA Cup and three League Cups won in 13 years at Old Trafford.Rooney’s frustration under Allardyce was not disguised, with the manager substituting him early against Manchester City and Liverpool at Goodison, yet it registered as a shock to the forward’s camp when Farhad Moshiri, the major shareholder, said he would not stand in the way of a move this summer. Moshiri had received several inquiries and was open to to releasing Rooney from a rapidly rising wage bill.Even with a clear signal from the top that he was unwanted the veteran sought assurances from the new manager, Marco Silva, and director of football, Marcel Brands, about his role for this coming season before accepting DC United’s offer. None was forthcoming and, having never accepted a place on the margins, Rooney was not about to start now. The opportunity to play until 2021, something that was never going to be on offer from Everton and may not have been available next summer after a bit-part season, was also a factor in the final decision.Rooney readily accepts he is past his best after 253 goals in 559 appearances for United, 28 in 118 for Everton and 53 in 119 for England. However, as his goals and game intelligence showed last season in a poor Everton side, he should not be written off as another washed-up export to MLS. A more pertinent issue is how he settles with his young family in Washington – he would often travel to Liverpool even while playing for United – and adapts to the differing demands of football in the United States. He joins a DC United team who have fallen far from the heights of winning three of the first four MLS titles but who hope that, with a 20,000-seat stadium and the biggest signing in their history to help fill it, a fresh start beckons. It does for both parties.England’s all-time leading goalscorer takes his leave from the English game while the national team are experiencing something he never did – an enjoyable World Cup – but it would be remiss to question his impact and reputation. Rooney started on the streets of Croxteth and leaves England as one of its greats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd21e7170f7a73e8f2719ebedacb16fb18b210b3/0_114_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=955aabb49164eaf8f598d0d64c9336f0","title":"germany go out of world cup 2018 at group stage in pictures","story":"For the first time in 80 years Germany have not made it through to the World Cup second round.

Rate! Rate! You can rate the performances of each of the players involved in that fiasco out of 10. I’m not sure you’ll need any of the numbers to the right of No5, apart from a few exceptions. Japan goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima had a decent performance, while Kamil Grosicki, Jan Bednarek, Kamil Glik and Rafal Kurzawa were among the few Poland players to at least make an effort.What this means for England: If they top group G, they will play Japan in the next round. If they come second to Belgium, they will face Colombia.Group H: Colombia advance to the knockout stages as group winners after their win over Senegal. Japan go through in second place on the “fair play” rule.Irony alert: Japan go through on the “fair play” rule, despite putting in the most unsporting ten-minute shift of any team in this World Cup to date. Well done, Fifa. Well done.Here’s our snap on-the-whistle report from a very strange game in Volgograd.Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over and Poland have won. Good news for Japan though - Colombia have beaten Senegal in Samasa. Japan go through to the knockout stages courtesy of a better disciplinary record than the Sengalese. Two yellow cards was the difference.90+3 min: The referee waves at the Japanese players, apparently urging them to do something with the ball other than tap the ball between themselves. It’s been a farcical and surreal end to a very bad game. 90+2 min: The game’s being played at a walking pace. Japan’s players continue to pass the ball amongst themselves, inside their own half. Poland’s players are making no effort whatsoever to win it back and the neutrals in the stands are going berserk. 90 min: We’re in the final minute, Japan have the ball but are making no attempt to go forward and Poland are making no effort whatsoever to take it from them. “It’s testimonial stuff now,” says the BBC’s commentator. He’s not entirely correct – testimonials are supposed to be entertaining.89 min: In the interests of comedy entertainment, I really hope Senegal score. 88 min: Both sets of players have downed tools and are playing down the clock. I’m not sure the Poles know what’s going on, but they’re happy with their 1-0 win. Japan are content to lose 1-0 and hope Senegal don’t get another goal against Colombia. Meanwhile in the stands, the neutrals are getting very antsy with the entente cordiale being played out before them.85 min: Japan are playing a dangerous game here, trying to keep possession without doing anything with it in a bid to run down the clock. Poland are happy for them to continue doing so, but a Senegal goal against Colombia would mess things up for Japan. This has been a weird game. Very weird.83 min: Japan have two yellow cards fewer than Senegal and as things stand, that could mean the difference between the Asian side staying in the competition and their African counterparts going home.81 min: Makino goes perilously close to poking a Bereszynski cross from the right into his own net. From the ensuing corner, Poland head over. Japan substitution: Muto off, Hasebe on.80 min: Poland substitution: Slawomir Peszko on for Rafal Kurzawa, who has been one of Poland’s better players. 77 min: Correction: as things stand - Japan would still go through with Colombia ... on the fair play rule. Senegal would miss out.76 min: Meanwhile in Samara, Colombia lead Senegal by one goal to nil.73 min: Poland counter-attack. Grosicki curls a low cross from the left to the feet of Lewandowski on the edge of the Japan six-yard box and the striker skies the ball over the bar. That’s a hideous miss scoring was the easier option.71 min: Japan attack down the left flank, in desperate need for a goal. They win a corner, through the dogged persistence of Inui, the substitute. 66 min: Tomaoki Makino is booked for a shove on Lewandowski and Poland find themselves with a free-kick similar to that from which they scored, but on the other side of the pitch. Grosicki curls the ball in, but Japan clear courtesy of Southampton’s Maya Yoshida.65 min: After an hour of this game, Poland have finally sparked into life on the back of that goal. Japan make another change: Takashi Usami off, Takashi Inui on.63 min: The camera cuts to the stands, where assorted Japan fans are consulting their phones and tablets to see what’s going on in the Samara Arena.61 min: Southampton’s Jan Bednarek scores his first ever international goal and it’s a good one. Poland won a free-kick on the inside-left channel and Rafal Kurzawa curled the ball across the face of goal towards the far post. Rujnning towards goal, Bednarek struck the ball past Kawashima with a deft side-footed effort. As things stand, Colombia and Senegal will be going through, while Japan will exit the tournament.Game on!!! Bednarek scores with a side-footed volley from a Poland set-piece. Japan are in trouble.58 min: Japan take the corner and a game of head-tennis in the Poland penalty area ensues. The ball stands up for central defender Tomoaki Makino, who attempts an ambitious bicycle-kick. He connects, but sends the ball wide from a narrow angle.57 min: Glik concedes a corner as he blocks an Usami cut-back from the byline. 53 min: Japan counter-attack and Usami picks up the ball on the left flank. He cuts inside and with men up in support, unleashes a shot from distance. It’s blocked and with Japanese players committed deep in Poland territory, it’s the European side’s turn to launch a counter-attack. It ends with Eiji Kawashima being forced to dart off his line and smother the ball at the feet of Zielinski, who was trying to get on the end of a Grosicki cross from the right.For a keeper who many were expecting to be dropped in the wake of two unimpressive performances earlier in this tournament, Kawashima has done well today. Perhaps he has taken confidence from his manager’s show of faith in him - not only did Akira Nishino select the goalkeeper, he also gave him the captain’s armband. 51 min: Usami curls a dangerous cross from the left into the Japan penalty area towards Gotoku Sakai. Bereszynski heads clear for Poland.50 min: Poland throw-in, deep in Japan territory. Bereszynski concedes a stupid foul on Usami in the Japan penalty area and gifts possession back to Poland’s opponents. Awful stuff.49 min: Poland win a throw-in deep in Japan territory and immediately work the ball back to their goalkeeper. The whistles from the crowd ring out again.47 min: Shinji Okazaki goes down injured and is substituted 90 seconds into the second half. The Bundesliga-based Yuyo Osaka, who has just moved from Cologne to Werder Bremen, replaces him. 46 min: Japan get the ball rolling for the second half after a quick mid-game huddle. There are no changes in personnel on either side. A Poland goal would liven things up no end, but it’s difficult to see where it might come from. They’re playing with the air about them of men who couldn’t care less if they lose this match.An email: “Compare Poland’s effort to South Korea, who also were already out of the tournament and beat Germany,” writes Richard McGahey. “Lots of pride for the Koreans, really unimpressive from the Poles.”Group H standings: With both matches scoreless at the moment, Japan and Senegal will progress to the knockout stages as things stand, while Colombia and Poland will go out.A first half to forget comes to an end. Japan are looking good to get the point they need from a Polish side whose only interest seems to be in getting this game out of the way and boarding the plane home.45+1 min: Poland’s players pass the ball around inside their own half, running down the clock. They have nothing to play for, but their lack of ambition is quite jaw-dropping. 45 min: There’ll be a minute of added time.43 min: Good covering from Usami, who breaks up a promising looking Polish counter-attack. Poland win a corner deep in Japanese territory, down by a corner flag. Within seconds, they’ve worked the ball back to the feet of Lucasz Fabianski. In the stands, the unrest starts, with the paying punters whistling and jeering the dross they’re being forced to watch.40 min: Usami crosses into the Poland penalty area, where Okazaki gets a flick with his head. The ball goes out for a corner off a Polish defender. Hiroki Sakai is grappled to the ground while waiting for the corner to be taken and complains to the referee.Not for the first time in this match, Adam Nawalka, the match officials, warns the Polish defenders about wrestling their men at corners, rather than just leaving them to it and awarding a penalty against one of them when the corner is taken. 39 min: Japan win a corner. Usami curls the ball into the Poland penalty area, where Fabianski claims confidently.36 min: Poland win a corner, which Grosicki sends into the mixer. Shinji Okazaki heads clear. Rafal Kurzawa follows up with a long range effort, but it’s high and wide. That corner came from a through ball that at least ventured into the same postal district occupied by Lewandowski, who has never scored a World Cup goal and must be getting very fed up with the lack of service being provided by his team-mates.

Rodriguez passes to Torres at the edge of the box and then takes the return ball and lets fly from 25 yards. It takes a deflection of Meriah, wrongfoots the keeper and trundles into the net!30 min: Meriah aims another pass from deep to Khazri, but Torres is wise to the forward’s run this time and cuts it out smartly. 27 min: So far these two teams have shown commendable attitudes ... and precisely why they are not going to be in the next round. 25 min: Barcenas wins the ball in midfield for Panama and is then chopped down by Chaaleli, who gets away with a lecture. Teams have been eliminated from this tournament for less.22 min: A sloppy pass by Skhiri in midfield gives Panama a chance to break. But they’re not good enough to capitalise.20 min: Tunisia are dominating this. Panama have pretty much just erected barricades around their own box for most of the match so far.18 min: Khazri’s corner is garbage. But so is the clearance, thus he gets a second chance. This time his cross is good and Meriah meets it at the back post, bringing a decent save from Penedo. “Panama was Colombian, not Nicaraguan...,” tut-tuts Magnus Westergren. 15 min: Khazri makes another canny run into the box and is found by another good pass from deep. The Sunderland player holds up the ball until support arrives in the form and, indeed, the person of Ben Youssef, whose shot from 20 yards is blocked. 13 min: Naguez floats over a cross from the right ... all the way to the Panamanian keeper. “I’m with you Paul, what’s the point of watching a reserve match, eh?” hollers Simon Thomas, a gentleman and knight. “A good fact about Panama is that it used to be part of Nicaragua until the Americans decided to build the canal and Nicaragua said no. So USA encouraged the Panamanian province to rebel. Which they did. And then invented the hat, the cigar and paper to celebrate.” Rather careless use of the word ‘fact’ there but we’ll let that slide.11 min: Machado flings a mighty throw from the right to the penalty spot. It’s flicked on to Gomez, whose header from eight yards drops wide.10 min: Kazri makes a clever run across the area and receives a pass from deep, laying it back for Sliti, who has a pop from the edge of the box. But he miscues and the ball veers away from the goal and into the stands. 9 min: Panama work Godoy into a good position at the edge of the Tunisian box before he’s crowded out.8 min: Fast, flowing interplay by Tunisia sends Panama reeling backwards but a decisive final pass is lacking.6 min: Sliti takes down a long diagonal ball on the left and then dodges Machado and curls a low cross towards Ben Youssef, who tries to flip it into the net from eight yards. But a defender makes a telling block.5 min: Now it’s Tunisia’s turn to deliver a freekick from the right into the danger zone. Khazri is normally precise from these situations ... but he over-hits it. 4 min: Freekick to Panama wide on the right. Avila sends over an in-swinger for forwards to run on to. But the keeper, Mathlouthi, trots out and makes an easy catch.2 min: Tunisia exert early pressure. They’re more creative and more technically adept than their opponents and they’re intent on proving that quickly.1 min: Three, two, one ... we have kickoff! The stadium in Saransk seems close to full - so not everyone is watching England v Belgium, then. Here come the teams. Tunisia are all in white, Panama are all in red. The officials should be dressed in a cross between the two but have decided to eschew pink and gone for chicken yellow outfits instead.Here’s some ideal pre-match viewing: a video on the political history of the World CupLet’s hope this match is played in the same spirit as third-place playoffs. It should be free of fear (except from Panama’s tackling, perhaps) and cynical pay, the perfect antidote to the end of that Japan-Poland outrage from earlier today. I can’t remember a third-place World Cup match that wasn’t entertaining.Hello, glad you could make it. You’d have done anything not to miss this one, right? There are no dead rubbers in the World Cup! Especially not for Tunisia and Panama, both of whom will be going full gun to get the win that would make their tournament if not a success, then at least not a total failure. Panama have obviously never won a World Cup match so victory here would be historic. And it would also mean a heck of a lot to Tunisia, who became the first African country to win at the World Cup when they beat Mexico in 1978 but have not managed another win since then.Poor old Tunisia haven’t had much luck for this tournament. They lost several key players to injury before it even started and have lost another few since arriving in Russia. They’re missing two of their first-choice defenders today – Dylan Bronn and Syam ben Youssef – but, most significantly, two of their goalkeepers have also been struck down, which means that their third-choice keeper, Aymen Mathlouthi, is the only one available for this match. Mathlouthi doesn’t lack experience – he was his country’s No1 for years before falling down the pecking order in recent months – but he may be short of match fitness. And who knows who’ll replace him if he, too, comes to some kind of harm during this game. And let’s face it, there’s a real risk of that happening given Panama’s robust approach. On the plus side, Tunisia’s problems at the back – along with Panama’s problems at the back - will surely encourage the North Africans to attack more. And Panama intend to do likewise. That is why their defender Felipe Baloy reckons people should be tuning into this game rather than the group decider. “It’s difficult to ask fans to watch our match instead of England and Belgium because they have players who are world class,” admitted Baloy. “But I invite people to watch our game because it will be a beautiful game and we are very proud to play our last game at the World Cup.” Let’s be having you!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206b34e835b6a2c0d9a8b73801371dc6ba97645e/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5064037c92c3fad21c69dabcf1588177","title":"world cup 2018 england v belgium live","story":"34 min: Alexander-Arnold wins a corner with the free kick, then takes that as well. He finds Loftus-Cheek by the near post he whacks a header wide left of goal.33 min: Denconcker is booked for a late clatter into Rose, who was making his way down the left. Belgium are now three yellow cards worse off than England in this World Cup, should it come to that. As things stand, England are winning this group because of their superior disciplinary record.31 min: Alexander-Arnold strides down the right, then very nearly sends an Accidental Ronaldinho into the top left from an absurd position. For a second, Courtois was backpedalling in a frantic manner there, but the ball ended up clearing the bar easily enough.29 min: That’s two very tatty incidents in the England box now. Some uncertain defending by the second string, though Cahill and Alexander-Arnold will be pleased enough with their goal-line heroics, so in that sense it’s swings and roundabouts.27 min: Suddenly a purposeful run, as Batshuayi goes for Stones down the inside right. He wins a corner, from which there’s an almighty scramble in front of Pickford. Fellaini hoicks goalwards. Alexander-Arnold clears off the line. Januzaj latches onto the rebound, but can’t get a shot away. England survive.26 min: Belgium are hogging the ball now. And going absolutely nowhere. Not that they’re looking to advance particularly urgently.24 min: Januzaj and Tielemans tease England down the right, but can’t piece together the move that’d unlock the defence. A bit more possession for Belgium, though, who are passing their way into this match.22 min: We’re back in Friendly Mode. Events rocking at a gentle, summer-evening pace. To be fair, both sets of fans are giving it plenty nonetheless. A fine atmosphere in the stadium. It’s been a loud World Cup, pleasingly soundtracked by some glorious bedlam.20 min: Alexander-Arnold takes. Belgium deal with it easily enough, thanks to a fine clearing header by Chadli.19 min: After a bright start, this match is in danger of slipping into Friendly Mode. Ah hold on! Scrub that! Rose picks up the pace on the left and is unceremoniously hacked down by Tielemans, who is booked and doesn’t bother complaining about it, which shows self-awareness if nothing else. A free kick, and a chance for England to load the Belgian box.17 min: Belgium aren’t doing all that much in attack. Januzaj dinks one down the inside-right channel, in the hope of Batshuayi and Fellaini combining on the edge of the England box. But it’s not happening.15 min: Vardy, deep on the right, rolls a pass down the wing and isn’t far away from finding Rashford on the edge of the area. Courtois comes out to deal with the situation.14 min: Alexander-Arnold looks very bright down the right wing. He tears after a long pass and hooks a bouncing ball into the area. Vardy’s header flashes wide left of goal. England are enjoying the three-lions’ share of possession so far: 61 percent of it.12 min: Alexander-Arnold works hard down the right to win a corner. That set piece leads to another on the opposite side of the pitch, a Rashford shot having been deflected out of play. Alexander-Arnold takes this one, and loops it deep. Cahill wins a header at the far post, but nuts it wide, and he was pushing and shoving anyway.10 min: England nearly concede a farcical goal! Januzaj dinks a cross into the mixer from the right. Fellaini, by the left-hand post, heads down for Batshuayi, who tries to flick a fancy one into the goal from close range. His effort is smothered by Pickford ... who then lets the ball squirt through his arms. It’s heading over the line, but Cahill hooks off the line to save his keeper’s blushes.9 min: Delph hoicks long down the left wing and nearly releases both Rashford and Vardy. The England strikers are in full Scamper Mode.8 min: A bit of space for Rose down the left, but he can’t find anyone with his cross. The early signs suggest both sides are going for this, which is nice to see. 6 min: Belgium press and probe for the first time. Suddenly Tielemans, just right of centre, 25 yards out, snaps a shot goalwards. It’s creeping under the bar, but straight at Pickford, who stops with a strong arm. The rebound doesn’t fall to a red shirt. A fine shot, and a save to match.4 min: Rose rakes a long pass down the left for Rashford, who briefly worries Boyata. Rashford looks up for this. It’s been a brisk start by England, which fits in with the following theory, as reported by David Flynn: “Eamon Dunphy on RTE just speculated that Southgate knows England won’t win the World Cup and so wants to beat Belgium knowing that there’s not much between the two possible second round teams, and it would either look great if they beat Brazil or look not that bad if they lost to Brazil.”2 min: A very uncertain start by Thorgan Hazard, who plays a blind pass back down the Belgian left and sends Vardy skittering down the wing. Vardy looks for Rashford in the middle, but his low, hard cross is kicked away by Courtois. Meanwhile a word of warning from Philip Ritson: “Didn’t Roy make wholesale changes in the last group game at Euro 2016? Look what happened next!”1 min: England stroke it around the back awhile. Then Vardy looks for Rashford down the inside-right channel, but the pass is way too heavy. Goal kick, and a chance for Belgium to get a feel of the ball.And we’re off! England get the party started. “Aptly enough, the shin pad font seems to be Nashville, or close to it,” spots Grant Tennille. “Pretty fitting for Fellaini, considering how he fancies working himself into your ear, albeit via his elbow.”The teams are out! We’ll be off soon, but first it’s time for the national anthems. La Brabançonne bumps along with a quiet dignity. ♭♮♯ Noble Belgium, O mother dear  To you we stretch our hearts and arms  With blood to spill for you, O fatherland!  We swear with one cry – You shall live! ♭♮♯And now please be upstanding for England’s equally glorious rallying call. ♭♮♯ Kick, kick, kick, kick  Kick, kick, kick, kick  Kick, kick, kick, kick  Kicky, kicky, kick, kick ♭♮♯Roberto Martinez talks! “Every player who has been fully fit to start a game will start in the outfield positions. We feel the goalkeeper should have some continuity in a tournament like the World Cup. I don’t think Vincent Kompany is fully fit to play 90 minutes so that is why he is not starting.”So England will be playing in their very fetching first-choice white shirts. Belgium are to be decked out in their equally pretty red tops with fancy early-80s-style flash. “Can’t we just skip the game, assume England pick up another yellow, and draw lots?” wonders Robbie Schwieder. “Would probably be the fairest outcome at this point, given the travesty of non-competition they seem set to put on. And who wouldn’t like to see a little lot-drawing? Give the people what they want!”Siddharth Singh adds: “Swearing at the ref or each other (we need Dele Alli for that) might be an option but surely the tactic is for the players to go shirtless last minute of the game?” A peek inside the England dressing room. It’s very futuristic, isn’t it. I prefer a nice relaxing wood panelling myself, but each to their own.Meanwhile Belgium’s kit comes packaged in an equally futuristic plastic parcel, like an unsatisfactory airplane blanket. Personalised shin-pads too, but no consistency of font across equipment.Pre-match excitement (in descending order of rabidity): “As sure as the objective stance is that England should play to lose, and therefore win the weaker side of the draw, I completely reject that theory,” begins Hubert O’Hearn. “You know as well as I do that if England lose all we’ll hear about is ‘England are horrible they only defeated two absolute minnows.’ Worse than our hearing it, the players will hear it too. In creeps self-doubt, in creeps conservative play, out thuds England. Win the damn game because ... IT’S COMING HOME!”Steven Hughes adds: “Football teams have pre-match plans on who’ll take the penalties, who’ll take the free-kicks, corners, perhaps long throws so maybe Southgate will also have detailed two or three players to use the F-word and C-word at the referee, in order to get themselves booked and England to an arguably easier half of the draw? Maybe Roberto Martinez will have anticipated this with some players of his own to unleash some profanities and counter-swear? It might be like a David Mamet play out there if it’s a draw after 80 minutes.”And finally Paul Griffin: “Only a Thameslink journey standing betwixt me and tellyside glass of Chablis with my beloved at kickoff. So if you need any colour on the ionisation of trackside metal, or the half-life of gravel, I’m your man. ‘It’ might be coming home. I might not be.”It might also be worth noting that England have only lost to Belgium once. If you discount a defeat on penalties after a 0-0 draw in the 1998 King Hassan II International Cup Tournament, that is, which all right-thinking people surely must. That loss occurred in 1936, Hendrik Isemborghs of Royal Beerschot the two-goal hero of Belgium’s 3-2 triumph. (George Camsell of Middlesbrough and Harold Hobbis of Charlton netted for England, for the record.) Meanwhile here’s some more TV riffin’: “So Thursday night, squad players getting a chance to impress, and the nagging feeling that it might be better to lose than to win. Is it on Channel Five?” Gary Naylor, ladies and gentlemen, the Europa League’s official satirist.England have played the representative team of the Union Royale Belge des Sociétés de Football Association at the World Cup on two previous occasions. In 1954, Ivor Broadis of Newcastle United and Nat Lofthouse of Bolton Wanderers scored two apiece in a 4-4 group-stage draw. England were in the habit of eight-goal thrillers back then: that game was the one which followed their record 7-1 defeat against Hungary in Budapest.The match - which had gone to extra-time after a 3-3 draw under Fifa’s strange contemporary system - was transmitted live on BBC Television and had a 100 percent audience share, on account of there being no other channels yet in existence. There will be no such boast from ITV tonight, because at least somebody will be watching Tunisia-Panama on ITV4. Paul Doyle, for starters.Then at Italia 90, David Platt scored. Here’s that.Pretty much as expected, Gareth Southgate rings the changes. Eight bells. Only Jordan Pickford, John Stones and Ruben Loftus-Cheek remain from the XI sent out to thrash Panama on Sunday. Step forward Trent Alexander-Arbold, Gary Cahill, Phil Jones, Eric Dier, Danny Rose, Fabian Delph, Marcus Rashford and Jamie Vardy. Harry Kane must cool his Golden Boots. Belgium boss Roberto Martinez goes one better, with nine changes to the team named against Tunisia on Saturday. Only Thibaut Courtois and Dedryck Boyata survive the cull. In come Leander Dendoncker, Thomas Vermaelen, Nacer Chadli, Mousa Dembele, Marouane Fellaini, Youri Tielemans, Thorgan Hazard, Adnan Januzaj and Michy Batshuayi. Romelu Lukaku must cool his Golden Boots. The race for topsecond spot: what if this match ends in a draw? Good question, because England and Belgium have identical records in Group G ... nearly. They’ve both got the same number of points. And the same goal difference. And they’ve scored the same number of goals. So it’ll be down to the fair-play record. As things stand, England have picked up two yellow cards to Belgium’s three, so they’d top the group. But that may change if anyone gets the funk on this evening. And if they can’t be separated by yellows and reds, it’ll be the drawing of lots. That would be quite something. Hey, speaking of disciplinary measures, Uruguay have been well behaved so far, haven’t they?Group H has just been completed. So we now know the top team in Group G will face Japan in the second round, then if they get through, the winners of Brazil and Mexico. The runners-up get Colombia, and a theoretically easier run to the semis, because they’d then meet Sweden or Switzerland if they made the quarters. But, well, you know how these things have a habit of panning out, so best not to count any chickens.Well, this is the sort of thing you don’t see every day: a World Cup match in which neither side is too fussed about losing. The thought process being, second place in Group G will avoid the side of the knockout draw containing Brazil, France, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez. Yay! A no-brainer! Come on, Belgium, do your worst! The lads can take it!Though things are never quite as simple as that, are they? For a start, the other side of the draw features Spain, the hosts Russia, Croatia (who have the best midfield in the tournament) and a Swedish side that has already barged its way past four-time winners Italy and the now-deposed champions Germany. Ulp!The other thing to be considering: momentum’s a precious commodity at a major tournament. It’s the stuff of life, the energy that takes you all the way. Belgium are coming off a match in which they found the net five times England have just scored six. Six goals! At a World Cup! That’s another thing you don’t see every day, no matter how bad Panama are at football. It’d be quite nice to keep the mood buoyant. Both sides will have that in mind.Hopefully we’ll still have a game on our hands, then. But no matter if not, because both of these teams are already through to the knockout phase, and whatever happens tonight, they’ll be four games away from glory. Glory! Hallelujah! Just imagine! Oh lordy. But it’s OK to dream. It’s free, they can never take it away from you, and it’s all part of the fun. Enjoy tonight. It’s on!Kick off: 7pm in Blighty, 8pm at the Arena Baltika on Oktyabrsky Island in Kaliningrad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/158a5e0584320feb1ba5904ef9d2895d158e71b2/0_59_2172_1303/master/2172.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23832e644263f5a0c8435910da80a25d","title":"world cup 2018 germany reaction and england v belgium buildup live","story":"Jamie Vardy will replace Harry Kane for England on Thursday – plus reaction to Germany’s World Cup exitThe big pre-match news ahead of England versus Belgium is that Harry Kane will be rested and Jamie Vardy will lead the line in the Group G decider in Kaliningrad.Gareth Southgate is also expected to give a number of others the chance to impress against a Belgium team that could be completely different from the one that won their opening two games. Either way, despite both teams already guaranteed progression, it should be quite an intriguing night of football.In the meantime, there are two more matches and plenty of reading to be done. . .Marcel Desailly on Messi Stuart James with the England v Belgium Italia ’90 playersSenegal v Colombia LIVE with Simon Burnton Japan v Poland LIVE with Barry Glendenning The same game in Japanese with Ben Mabley Colin writes: “Gareth Southgate has not thought this through. He should have brought Rooney along for this kind of game, guaranteed yellow or red.”Gareth Barry would also be useful for this situation.Maybe I’ll just watch Panama v Tunisia to be obtuse. Not much work is being done across the country as the nation decides how best tonight match should play out. . . Nick offers: “I reckon the ideal scenario for England is for someone to get sent off early on – one of the second string as it doesn’t really matter if they’re suspended for the next game – and then the rest of the team hold on for a resilient, fortifying 0-0 draw. Belgium top the group on fair play countback and go into the testier half of the draw and England show they have the defensive mettle alongside all the attacking verve.“It’s also the ideal scenario for more as I’m going to miss a potential quarter-final if we win the group – I’m on a plane. I don’t really know how this happened.”If you want some more mocking of Germans. . .We’re closing on the 3pm kick-offs! We will have live blogs of both Senegal v Colombia and Japan v Poland, with the additional treat of the latter also coming with a Japanese version. We’ve all considered it, David.With both teams contemplating a second place finish as preferable tonight there might be plenty of shots from 45 yards in the hope neither side score.He writes: “Was Xhaka’s goal against Serbia further out? It felt like it was from the halfway line.”Ian ponders: “If England or Belgium deliberately and obviously scored an own goal in the last minute, would that count as unsporting behaviour? Would the ref therefore be within his rights to book the player involved and award a free kick to the other side instead?”Surely the modern international can score an own goal and not make it look obvious.Michal asks: “Just out of interest- what did you bring for lunch? I myself had pasta with tomato sauce and some melted gorgonzola.”I made some chorizo and peas to go with cod last night and have used the extra with pasta for lunch.Away from England and Belgium, Luke takes up back to the simpler time of longest goals.He says: “At work, I have access to a software application that uses algorithms to work out distances on the pitch from a video clip. This application confirms that Josh’s estimate of 26 yards for Modric’s goal is spot on. It also confirms Richard’s suspicion that Kolarov’s was further out which it measures at 30.7 yards.“As I have spent time working this out when I am supposed to be working, and probably broken some copyright laws by downloading the relevant clips, I would appreciate if you did not use my real name..... “Dave” would do.”Does two second-string teams facing off make the game a bit more interesting that if both manager’s had stuck with their usual starting line-ups? Let’s be honest, if Kane et al were facing Hazard (Eden) \u0026amp Co. then it might have been a slow-paced affair, with neither team wanting to get injured nor suspended. Now we will get a collection of players wanting to impress to give Martinez and Southgate a decision or two in the knockout stages. Or am I clutching at straws?ITV will be pleased they held out for this group-decider, as their viewers get to be enthralled by Ryan Giggsy Giggs’s views on Danny Welbeck scuffed shot and why Adnan Januzaj did not make it at Manchester United.Anyway. . .speaking of Gareth Southgate, here he is on the his fear of missing out on being England manager.Bobby Martinez might change his 10 outfield players. It looks unlikely that Southgate will do the same, but it might not be far off that by the look of things, with only John Stones the only outfield man guaranteed to start a third match. Will he be bold enough to change the goalkeeper, too? Southgate has spoken about the misery of going to a major tournament and not playing, although that might be preferably to missing a penalty in a semi-final. The England manager is going what he feels is right for the encounter with Belgium, who will also rest a number of players, and it will be a great boost for those two teams to really be able to go for it. All the other big-name teams have been forced to put our their strongest team for three games, so having 90 minutes fewer under the belt could be a great help for England’s key men.Jamie Vardy is to make his first World Cup start in England’s final Group G game against Belgium this evening, with the tournament’s top scorer to date, Harry Kane, set to start the match on the bench.Gareth Southgate is to make a number of changes to his lineup with progress into the knockout phase already secured, with Vardy – who came off the bench in the 6-1 win over Panama – to begin the game up front. Kane had indicated to the manager that he wanted to start the game in Kaliningrad, and add to his tally of five goals to date, but it appears as if the side’s captain will have to make do with a place among the substitutes.Raheem Sterling has been rested for the fixture, with Marcus Rashford the likeliest to start alongside Vardy up front. The Leicester City forward’s pace will be seen as a potent weapon on the counter-attack against the Belgians, who will see more of the ball than England’s two previous opponents in the group. Kyle Walker, who picked up a yellow card conceding a penalty against Tunisia, is also likely to be rested, with Phil Jones and Gary Cahill expected to start alongside John Stones in the back three.Eric Dier will play in defensive midfield and may captain the team, while Danny Rose will feature at left wing-back. Fabian Delph, who will return home to attend the birth of his third child after the game, has been pressing for a place in midfield and could come in for Ruben Loftus-Cheek, while Trent Alexander-Arnold could also feature given Kieran Trippier has been nursing a slight injury in the build-up.Well. . .after all the posturing of if players were going to be rested, we finally have an answer. Kane has had a long season and merits 90 minutes off during the chaos of the World Cup. It should also be noted that due to the lack of pace in the Belgian backline that Vardy might be the better option anyway.I am in favour of give a few different players a game and keeping them fit for the knockout stages. If Kane turns his ankle tomorrow, then you’d need Vardy, which would then result in a completely different formation and style for England, so it’s positive news in my book.Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy is set to lead the line for England tonight against Belgium, with captain Harry Kane the man likely to be rested. He says: “I guess one thing we’ve learnt is with the bricklayer’s first touch he displayed yesterday, Neuer’s no sweeper-midfielder.”Luckily, Manuel now has plenty of time to work on this for the rest of the summer.While manning the daily World Cup blog yesterday, I agreed to consume some surströmming if Sweden progressed and I will fulfil this promise once I find the time and muster the energy to do so.I planned ahead and brought my lunch, which will be consumed upon Michael’s return as I prepare my mind for a long day of football, which will conclude with me doing the pod tonight. Get your questions in early as I prepare to discuss the positives of England finishing firstsecond in the group.Good afternoon! As Michael goes in search of an ostrich burger, I will provide some light relief.Whatever the Swedish is for Schadenfreude etc etc. . .On that bombshell, I’m going for some lunch.

This has put me in a difficult position where I must pick one or the other – and as a result I pick my mother.”Some lunch-time reading for you:There’s also this from Stefan Stern on Gareth Southgate learning a few things Harvard Business School.“My team at work had no interest in the World Cup - two colleagues actually asked what it was,” emails Josh. “To drive interest I pinned up the obligatory wall chart and ran a sweepstake. To ensure enthusiasm remains high there are various prizes available, some ripped off from Will Dean’s 2016 article. Problem is - I can’t find any stats for the goal scored from the furthest distance!“Can you helpsuggest a place I can find this out? This will help me provide a post-group stages update to the team tomorrow.”I’m going to say Luka Modric’s goal against Argentina, which based on me measuring the pitch markings is 26 yards-ish out. Don’t agree? @ me. Harry Kane really does have it all. Waste even more of your employer’s valuable time by perusing our all singing-dancing World Cup player guide, which includes match ratings for every active player. Remarkably, Manuel Neuer managed to scrape a 410 for yesterday …Also, this is funny. “Good morning Michael, or should I say good evening,” emails Thomas Partridge. “I’m an Englishman living in Japan and I’ve been catching with the  live-blog diligently during my breaks at work. It’s particularly difficult being an England fan over here because all of our games seem to be starting at 3am, so I’ve been having to rely on the wonderful write-ups of your reporters to keep up to date. This World Cup has really been capturing the imagination of my Japanese colleagues. Before the tournament everyone here expected them to finish bottom of Group H , but Japan are currently the leaders! We are starting to believe!“Anyway, one World Cup story that’s getting a fair bit of play over here is the curious story of a Colombian fan who deceived a couple of Japanese fans into repeating horrible things about themselves in Spanish. I’m sure you can imagine what sort of thing he told them to repeat considering Colombia had just lost to Japan. I didn’t read anything about it in the English press, but it caused an uproar in the Colombia. The fan in question is now a national pariah and I believe he was even fired from his job in absentia. It was quite heartening to read about South American fans standing-up to sexual harassment in this post #metoo age.”We need to talk about Group H. Japan v Poland and Senegal v Colombia both kick-off at 3pm BST. This is how things stand. For those of you that didn’t see this earlier: Japan will progress if they get at least a draw against eliminated Poland. Colombia and Senegal face each other. A draw in that game will be enough for Senegal to progress. A draw might also be enough for Colombia to progress, but they would be relying on Poland beating Japan at the same time.This is also the only group in which a European team will not qualify for the knockout round. In fact, the non-European winner of Group H will go into the ‘easier’ half of the group, in which every other team is European: Spain v Russia, Croatia v Denmark, Sweden v Switzerland, Group H winner v BelgiumEngland. Which is the perfect excuse to shoehorn this into the liveblog. Could genuinely watch it on repeat all day. So where is everyone watching the game tonight? I’m clocking off at 3pm. Interesting to see how many tune in to ITV4 for the big one tonight: Panama v Tunisia. We’ve talked a little about Diego this morning. You should click on this piece by Marcela Mora y Araujo, and not just because of its magnificent picture. Manuel Neuer has spoken into a DFB dictaphone this morning, with the following results: You have to say we do not deserve (to go through). In the second round everybody would have liked to play against us. How are we going to be dangerous to an opponent if we do not get our performance (right)? We gave a bad picture in the three games. I can not answer why that happened. We have to take responsibility. We screwed up, (and) we screwed up together.”Asked whether he felt he had a future with the national side, Neuer replied: “I do not intend to stop.” An email from Kevin O’Rourke, who is not alone in my inbox in thinking Croatia are among the favourites to WIN THE BLOODY WORLD CUP. “I’m thinking that Croatia are finalist material. They seem the most dangerous team and waltzed through their relatively strong group. England losing to Belgium gives a semi against Croatia. Beating them means a quarter against Brazil – shocking defensively - Neymar is a reductive show pony who makes them less than the sum of their parts. And semi against most likely France or Uruguay – one has been toothless in a middling group, the other had too many teeth in the weakest groups.”“Wutcha Michael,” emails Paul Lees. “I’ve been loving the World Cup so far and I think it will go down as a classic. There’s been some terrific team performances so far but who do you think has been the standout inidual player so far? Personally I can’t really think of any one player … Hazard? Kane? Ronaldo? Tripper?!”Hard to look past Coutinho in my book, although Ronnie surely can’t be far behind. The quick quiz of the ’s other web bods today yields the following results: And if you think you know what’s going on, this is a good place to carry on.

Bye!Pictures just in from Bogota:And from Dakar:He’s asked about his team’s struggles to defend set pieces.Is it normal? When a goal is scored after a set piece, or without one, is it normal? You don’t want to concede goals but set pieces exist. It’s not a question of tactics or spirit or size. We’ve worked a lot on set pieces both from a defensive and an offensive point of view. We have conceded from a set piece in this match again.And he’s asked about his team’s focus on Colombia’s right flank:We knew their right wing was very dangerous. We didn’t want to give any space to Cuadrado and we were able to close that wing. Maybe Sabaly and Balde were not as fresh in the second half, it may have happened. But I look at the match and I think Senegal should have qualified for the next round. We deserved it.He’s asked about the World Cup and the organisation:Magnificent. I’ve played in a World Cup in Japan, now I’ve had a World Cup in Russia as a coach. I would say the organisation is superb, the people are extraordinary. I’d like to thank our team hotel. The people were very nice. I’d like to thank them very warmly and I think it’s great publicity for this nation.More from Aliou Cissé: Had we scored in the first half nobody would have said anything. Second half, the team created opportunities. We weren’t able to convert but that’s too bad. I found a team which was very focused and wanted to go ahead, but we have seen major teams eliminated in the first round. We still have to work but I’m sure we will do great things in the future.We were aware of the regulations but Senegalese players are highly committed. It is difficult to play well if you’re not highly committed. I can’t ask my players to go on the pitch to avoid yellow cards. You have to be in contact with other players when you play football. This is how we play. We need this, and it is a shame that it worked against us.”Though according to Fifa’s statistics Senegal have only attemped 17 tackles, fewest of all teams to have played three matches, while Japan are in 16th place with 31. How they managed to turn 17 tackles into six yellow cards I don’t know.(Though apparently England only attempted four tackles in their first two matches combined, which even against limited opponents seems an incredibly low total. Belgium have attempted five)You’ve got to admire Akira Nishino, though. He dropped six players including most of his best ones and then neutralised the latter stages, accepting a 1-0 defeat, when a point for Senegal would have knocked Japan out. That was some high stakes gambling.You may now reward the players with marks out of 10:“Win the group tonight and we avoid Colombia in the next round,” writes Matt Kelcher. “They have been one of the more impressive teams in the tournament so far. Surely far more important than some hypothetical quarter- or semi-final down the line?” They weren’t wildly impressive here, mind, and it looks like James Rodriguez won’t be fully fit, and potentially not available at all. If I were in charge, I’d have made sure the team received one extra booking against Panama to go into this game dead level. But then I want lots. Lots of lots.The BBC are reporting that England will make eight changes for this evening’s game.So now all the speculation is over. England and Belgium know precisely where they stand:And here’s the group table:There will be no African teams in the round of 16. It sounds like the final 10 minutes of the Poland v Japan game were an absurd display of mutually-convenient (though not without risk) time-wasting.90+5 mins: It‘s all over! Colombia are through as group winners, and Senegal are out!90+4 mins: Poland have beaten Japan 1-0. Senegal have one minute to score a goal and seal their place.90+2 mins: Carlos Sanchez has a shot from 50 yards, which misses by about 30 yards. “The yellow card tally tie-break is really unreasonable,” writes Patrick Sullivan. “With it, Shaqiri’s shirt-pull after a great goal could arguably have knocked the Swiss out. Given that yellows are handed out in an inconsistent manner across matches, this is the worst of policies. Way to go, Fifa!” I agree. Use shots on target, or decibels of player anthem singing, or something better instead.90+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there will be four minutes or thereabouts. They’ve played excellently in almost all respects today, but haven’t really created anything. Which, to be fair, is quite a major respect.89 mins: Colombia are taking off Falcao. The added bonus here is that he has to walk slowly to Carlos Sanchez in order to slowly transfer the captain’s armband before slowly leaving the field. Borja is on.86 mins: No team has ever been eliminated from the World Cup because of their disciplinary record. If this group had finished like this in 2014 lots would have been drawn.86 mins: A final change for Senegal. Niang is off, and Sakho is on.85 mins: The ball bounces inside Colombia’s area. Mina wins the header, goes over Mane, and wins a slightly generous free-kick.83 mins: Colombia make a change, Uribe strolling slowly off and Lerma coming on.82 mins: These last 10 minutes or so are perfectly set up for the neutral. A goal for Japan, Poland or Senegal would transform the table. Senegal find Mane in the area, but he’s just offside.81 mins: Sarr then flies down the right flank in a display of wild pace, but his cross is cleared.80 mins: Chance for Senegal! Mane’s cross picks out Sarr, who volleys wildly high! His team then makes another change, as Konate replaces Keita Balde.79 mins: Senegal, as it stands, are going out because of two bookings earned in stoppage time of one match.78 mins: Senegal have a corner, which is erted by Mina to Ospina, who makes the save and stays down, clutching his face, for no good reason.77 mins: Save! Niang, wide to the right of goal, slams in a hard, high shot and Ospina pushes it away!76 mins: Senegal had been down to 10 men after Sabaly limped off, so they had no choice but to make the substitution when they did, but it probably didn’t help their concentration.75 mins: As it stands, Colombia win the group, Japan are second, and Senegal are out!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9283c3cdf9de4f2deacf051dc4d0bc237a6f7ac/0_126_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc2d803e1a7722684c215d638b1a5326","title":"london property prices blamed for record exodus","story":"Number of people leaving capital to move elsewhere in UK is at its highest levelThe number of people leaving London for a new life elsewhere in the UK has reached its highest level, according to an analysis of official data.More than 330,000 people made the move during the year to June 2017. Newham was the London borough that experienced the biggest exodus, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.As recently as 2016, London was the fastest-growing English region, but its growth rate halved in the space of a year, driven by people in their 30s and early 40s with young children deciding to pack up and leave, according to the ONS.Estate agent Knight Frank, which analysed the figures, said they showed that migration from London to other parts of the UK had reached a record level. It added: “As well as a desire to trade up the housing ladder in search of more space, increased employment opportunities outside London means people are becoming more confident to make the move from the capital.”Top destinations for London leavers were said to include Birmingham, Brighton, Thurrock in Essex, Bristol, Dartford in Kent and Epping Forest, on the border of north-east London and Essex.The figures came a day after a report from the Resolution Foundation thinktank said London’s expensive property prices were leading to an exodus of people in their early 30s.The ONS revealed that the UK’s population was 66,040,229 as at 30 June 2017, an increase of 392,000 since mid-2016. This represented the lowest annual rate of growth since 2004, and was attributed to a fall in net migration, fewer births and more deaths than in previous years.“The effect is most pronounced in London and other areas that have seen high levels of immigration in recent years,” said Neil Park, head of the population estimates unit at the ONS.Areas of the capital that experienced large outflows include Newham, the east London borough where the 2012 Olympic stadium, now home to West Ham, is situated. There, the “internal migration inflow” totalled 21,326, but more people – 31,175 – left for other parts of the UK. There were similar trends in Brent, Ealing, Haringey and Redbridge.“London had a particular concentration of local authorities with high net outflows, reflecting the high net outflow for the London region overall,” said the ONS. “An important explanation for this is that many parents with young children move out of London.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14285d5417f43df3834e275621d7084f2b93cbc6/931_1549_8330_4997/master/8330.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dbcc29b24cdaefad1d8009bbe7135d2","title":"florence and the machine high as hope review","story":"Florence Welch’s fourth album is most powerful when focused on the small, telling details of encroaching adulthoodFlorence Welch recently told a journalist that her fourth album pursues a noticeably different direction. It is, she confirmed, less “Florence-y”. It’s a statement that is hard to read without raising a quizzical eyebrow. Being Florence-y means dealing in a showy kind of musical melodrama, where tribal drums meet sawing orchestras, grandiloquent piano and the singer’s war-cry voice, heavy on the vibrato. It’s an approach that has earned her three platinum albums and a level of fame that’s led Penguin to collect and publish her biro-written poems, lyrics and inspirational notes-to-self in a book.Moreover, we have been here before. Her last album, How Big How Blue How Beautiful, arrived in 2015 after advanced publicity suggested it was going to be less Florence-y, too: the stripped-down work, as she put it then, of “a quiet person”. In reality, it sounded like the work of a person who could drown out a car alarm at 20 paces an album during which you couldn’t swing the proverbial cat without clobbering a 36-piece orchestra, a lyrical metaphor involving Greek mythology or a massed choir of multi-tracked Florences turned up to 11.But the first single from High As Hope suggested that, this time, she might mean it. Sky Full of Song dials things down considerably compared with the florid arrangements and bug-eyed vocals of What Kind of Man?, the song that introduced How Big How Blue How Beautiful. The orchestra are present but hovering in the distance behind a muted double-bass. The Choir of the Massed Florences are in a subdued mood, the vocals so close-miked that you can hear her breathing between lines. There is a sense of someone who realised that heading any further down the path of her previous albums might have led her into the realms of self-parody.On occasion, the urge to go full-steam am-dram proves too hard to resist. The song 100 Years spends five exhausting minutes pelting the listener with every trick in the Florence book. Hunger takes a similarly Sturm und Drang approach, although its melodic foundations – and, indeed, her stark depiction of a teenage eating disorder – are strong enough to support the storeys of embellishment stuck on top. Elsewhere, she is capable of more restraint than ever before. Frequently, Welch’s notion of reining herself in simply involves waiting until the closing moments of a track before letting fly with the operatic vocal leaps and the thunderous drums. Nevertheless, these songs are allowed significantly more room to breathe than those on her previous albums.The relative lack of clutter reveals something intriguing. Clearly desperate to be the kind of artist who constructs a phantasmagorical world in which listeners might lose themselves, Welch turns out to be really adept at something more earthbound. The music is most appealing when it is pared back – as on the sparse opener June – and her voice is most powerful when she isn’t belting it out. Similarly, High As Hope’s most emotionally impactful lyrics come when she abandons the rococo metaphors and focuses on small, telling details. She is very sharp on that point in your early 30s when the realisation dawns that you can’t keep deluding yourself you’re not really an adult yet. There’s a lovely section in Hunger in which the music builds as she feels the mounting excitement of Friday approaching, only to realise that the messy hedonism of the weekend is something she is better off observing fondly from a distance: “Oh you and all your vibrant youth,” she sings, looking on, “how could anything bad ever happen to you?” South London Forever mixes up fuzzy memories of youthful indiscretions – staggering from a pub, “holding hands with someone I just met” while on ecstasy – with a warning that you should enjoy that stuff while you can, before indulging in it makes you a crushing embarrassment: “It doesn’t get any better.”The latter song is poignant and airily beautiful: it doesn’t need a tacked-on grand finale. That it has one highlights the problem at the heart of High As Hope, an album that is undoubtedly a progression from her previous work, filled with well-written songs but still frustrating to listen to. It gives the distinct impression that there is a different artist somewhere within Florence Welch, struggling against the desire for grandiosity and the kind of big musical statements that have powered her career. High as Hope suggests she should sweat the small stuff more often.• Comments on this review will be pre-moderated.Georgia Anne Muldrow – OverloadThe first fruit of the soul auteur’s hook-up with Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder label: beautifully poised between classic 90s R\u0026ampB and something strange, disorientating and psychedelic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad4ec01b6ca337780d1d282562daf89062219205/0_121_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=657dab446d74bbc7cb8bdb22f911b79c","title":"wireless festival women only stage","story":"Twenty-five female artists, including Lady Leshurr and Paigey Cakey, will play the new stageFollowing criticism over its lack of women performers, Wireless festival has announced a stage that will exclusively feature female artists. Only three of the 37 acts announced in January were women: R\u0026ampB singer Mabel, rapper Cardi B – who has since cancelled owing to her advanced pregnancy – and dancehall MC Lisa Mercedez.Artists including Birmingham MC Lady Leshurr, Spanish reggaeton artist Bad Gyal, and British MC Paigey Cakey are among the 25 artists appearing on the new stage, to be hosted by Beats 1 presenter Julie Adenuga and Rinse FM DJ Emerald and organised by Smirnoff’s Equalising Music campaign, a global initiative to address the gender imbalance in music.“I remember seeing the flyer with all the male names taken out, it was so shocking to see that and it really hit home,” Emerald told the BBC. “Not even the lack of women, but the volume of men. It was just so overpowering.” She accepted that the women-only stage could be perceived as tokenism. “But what are we going to do? Not have that stage there and have no women performing at the festival? I don’t think that’s the right thing to do.”Vanessa Reed, chief executive of the PRS Foundation, welcomed the additional stage. “This positive response goes to show that there are lots of talented female artists out there waiting to be booked. I hope other bigger festivals will follow suit. Alongside talent development programmes, we need to see more women on stages right now. That’s the only way that younger girls and women getting into music will be able to see themselves up there in the future as part of an industry that’s open to all.”Melvin Benn, director of Festival Republic, told the BBC that Wireless had originally approached more than 20 acts featuring women who were unable to perform due to touring and other commitments. “We’d love to see more female acts on the festival roster in the future. However, there is a bigger industry issue at the heart of the debate on lineup ersity, with fewer female acts available at all levels,” he said.The debate around gender equality at festivals has persisted into 2018. Green Man festival in Wales has been criticised for including four all-female acts in its initial 20-strong lineup announcement. Punk festival Slam Dunk only had two bands featuring women across its 16 acts. Green Man director Fiona Stewart told the  that booking women at the top of the bill had been hard this year: “There is an industry-wide issue of fewer female acts available at all levels that has affected the booking process.”Now in its 13th year, Wireless festival takes place in Finsbury Park, north London, from 6-8 July. Rapper J Cole, grime star Stormzy and hip-hop mogul DJ Khaled will headline.

Flying to Brussels was the prime minister’s very own “me time”. A time when she could put her feet up and no one or nothing could get to her for an hour or so. Several members of her cabinet could have launched blue-on-blue attacks. One of two might even have resigned. And she would be none the wiser. Which is just the way she liked it.Life was about to get better still. Her two-day visit to the European council was about to merge into a four-day weekend because she literally had nothing to do. The summit was meant to be the time when the prime minister spelled out the final details of Britain’s withdrawal agreement with the EU but what with one thing and another – mainly her incompetence and cluelessness – this had been pushed back yet again.She was now hoping she would be in a position to announce the terms of the withdrawal six months after Britain had withdrawn. So she could sit back, kick off her shoes and let the other EU leaders rabbit on. They might all get round to discussing Brexit once she had left, but it worked better for everyone that way. It was the only way any progress could be guaranteed.Shortly after landing, May stopped off for a coffee. It was customary to let the more important EU leaders turn up first, so she had time to kill and could watch them arrive on TV. There were Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel embracing one another. May felt a small pang of sadness. There was a time when she might have been a member of the inner circle. There again, she wasn’t even a member of the inner circle in her cabinet any more.A little later, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, appeared and gave a mini press conference. After talking about immigration, he was asked for his thoughts on how Brexit was progressing. “I don’t want to say it’s apocalyptic but…” he said. But it was apocalyptic. Next came the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. “We had been expecting progress … any progress,” he said unhelpfully. Was Britain really being serious in its negotiations. “We’ll have to wait and see.” If there had been anything left alive in Theresa, it too would have died at that point.Then the prime minister got the nod. There was a spare five minutes on the red carpet if she wanted to use it. May wandered purposefully towards the only microphone that wasn’t switched on so her opening words went unrecorded. Eventually the sound cut in and she could be heard saying how happy she was that the summit was prioritising the prohibition of chemical weapons. Everyone looked blank. They had imagined immigration was the main subject up for discussion.Next came the Brexit question. “We are making very good progress,” said May. The blank faces turned even blanker. What did she imagine little progress would look like? A reporter pointed out that wasn’t what the other EU leaders were saying. “We’ve been setting things out,” she babbled desperately. “We’re in a strong position … we want to sit down and move at pace.” A snail’s pace.Once inside the main hall, the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, made a beeline for the prime minister. Pulling a Belgian football shirt out of his bag, he thrust it into May’s hands. Which she promptly held up for the cameras. Half time: Belgium 1 (May og), England 0.“Oh look,” she said. “It’s got a Number 10 on it. I live at Number 10. What a coincidence! Are Belgium playing tonight?”Michel couldn’t believe his luck and started distributing Belgium scarves to everyone else. Jean-Claude Juncker held his above his head. So, too, did Varadkar. Before long the whole room was pointing at the prime minister and chanting, “You’re shit and you know you are you’re shit, and you know you are.” Final score: Belgium 27, England 0."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12be8ca26915bb67abd16eea59c550be7c19e018/936_624_4098_2460/master/4098.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa805dd132c98cd6bf6104e7e766468","title":"theresa may scores own goal holding up belgium football shirt","story":"Prime minister has team’s top handed to her by Belgian counterpart They say sports and politics make uneasy bedfellows, and Theresa May will no doubt now agree. At the start of a summit of EU leaders in Brussels, the British prime minister was ambushed by her Belgian counterpart, Charles Michel, who presented her with a Belgium football team top ahead of the England v Belgium World Cup game.May held up the Red Devils’ strip, before realising that doing so might be considered a PR gaffe. She attempted to swiftly stash it away only for fellow leaders gathered around her to point to the TV monitors showing her reaction live to a packed hall of reporters outside the leaders’ meeting room. . The French president, Emmanuel Macron, appeared particularly amused by the jape.The shirt – unfurled by Michel from a gift box – had 10 on the back, perhaps a nod to May’s Downing Street home, or Belgium’s finest player, Eden Hazard. To her credit, the prime minister appeared to take the incident in good spirit, although she is known to be more of a cricket fan, with a fondness for the slow but steady batting of Geoffrey Boycott.Michel went on to pass around Belgian football scarves to some of the other EU leaders. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who admitted he would be cheering on Belgium in their tie with England, happily posed with one, as did Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, beamed as he was handed a scarf, with the match seemingly taking on some symbolic value at a crunch time in the Brexit negotiations.The prime minister later gave Michel a replica England shirt at a dinner where she addressed the other 27 leaders on her plans for the relationship after Brexit. On handing him the top, May told the Belgian premier: “The equalizer.” She also brought souvenir T-shirts for his two children, with the flags of the two footballing nations on the front, and the date of the tie. A UK government source said: “The Belgian prime minister obviously decided that he needed to get in ahead of the first whistle.”As for support for the England team, there wasn’t much on show at the summit. However, Varadkar later pointed out that a loss for England could, due to the vagaries of the group stage, lead to an easier path for Gareth Southgate’s team to an unlikely second World Cup victory, by avoiding an early match with Brazil. “It could be a win-win situation,” Varadkar told reporters of his decision to back the Belgians.The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who was also at the summit, tweeted of Varadkar’s comments: “This tells us all we need to know. He really is the yes-man of Europe.”A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.Ireland, with the support of 26 member states, is piling on the pressure for the UK to come up with a solution that will avoid a hard border in Ireland after Brexit.The UK ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, has been given the job of updating the prime minister on the progress of the match with Belgium, a host nation for EU institutions, as the match clashed with the leaders’ meal.Farage, watching the match buildup from one of the heaving bars in the Brussels EU quarter, later described the tie with Belgium as a “grudge match”. Earlier this summer, in response to the MEP’s claim that Belgium wasn’t a real country, the European parliament Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, had goaded Farage on Twitter: “He’ll see how real Belgium is when we play England in the World Cup!”Farage told the : “Losing could be better for England but pride and machismo got the better of me.” He added that a victorious Verhofstadt is always “unbearable”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ee0ae97247946e1e127267a7730aa371fa1741/0_3_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=917d8efcc8416b35cdb17b199b575633","title":"uk could be heading for very worst brexit says mays former policy chief politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including the start of the EU summit in Brussels.If I can deliver a humanitarian operation and it is cost appropriate and effective for me to seek the use of UK military assets to do so, then I will. The fact that my actions benefit another department is a reason for doing it, not a reason for not doing it. So, if there is spare capability in defence that development can use then we should do so, and we should foot the bill for it. This is not about the militarisation of aid, but about ensuring that each department plays a complementary role. What I am really interested in is that we are coming together and we are using both our budgets in the most sensible way. I want DfID and the MoD to develop our capabilities together.

He claimed:Stuff came to light this morning which had not been previously aired or known about in any shape or form, certainly not to the first minister, and that’s the basis on which she took the decision not to proceed with the nomination.Martin has since issued a lengthy apology (see 4.30pm) but in a detailed account of the restaurant tipping culture in New Orleans, her blog spoke of “American Blacks – don’t tip at all or tip next to nothing – to be avoided. The waiters (also black, remember) would do anything to avoid serving a table of blacks …”She went on: “American Jews – tip ok but only if you’ve absolutely busted your hump and everything was faultless in the extreme. Often complain about the quality of the food, and then the small portions (Copyright: Woody Allen)”This is from AFP’s Danny Kemp.This is from RTE’s Tony Connelly.Jon Lansman, the Momentum founder and member of Labour’s national executive committee, says the proposed changes to the way Labour elects its leader, parliamentary candidates and council leaders, which the  has been writing about this week, do not go far enough.The MSP Gillian Martin has issued this statement about her non-appointment today as a Scottish government education minister. (See 12.27pm and 1.26pm.) She said:I fully accept and understand the decision that the first minister has taken.In a blog I wrote 11 years ago across a range of issues I used language that was inappropriate and offensive. I reported comments from other people which have caused offence, and made statements in a way which does not represent my views then or now.I deleted this blog some time ago precisely because I accepted that it contained unacceptable content – but I recognise that these posts should never have been published in the first place.That is entirely my responsibility and I am deeply sorry.When parts of this blog were last raised publicly two years ago I apologised – and I unreservedly apologise today.Since my election as MSP for Aberdeenshire East in 2016, I have always campaigned hard for equalities and I will continue to do so.At the start of the EU summit in Brussels Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, also said the UK needed to clarify what sort of Brexit it wanted soon. He told reporters:I don’t have to lecture Theresa May, but I would like our British friends to make clear their positions.Asked if there was a risk there may not be a deal, he said: We are preparing for different scenarios - on the proper withdrawal agreement but, in parallel, we are working on the no deal.Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has tweeted a clip of an answer he gave in an interview saying he did not mind Liz Truss, the environment secretary, making a joke at his expense in a speech on Monday.(If you recall the joke, you make think “fantastic sense of humour” is stretching it.)I muddled up two EU PMs earlier, saying that it was Leo Vardakar posing in the Belgian football scarves picture when it was Xavier Bettel. I’ve corrected that now. (See 3.21pm.) Sorry.Here is my colleague Daniel Boffey on Theresa May and the Belgian football shirt.According to the Australian, the British defence giant BAE Systems has won a $35bn contract to ­deliver nine advanced anti-submarine warfare vessels.Sam Coates from the Times says Downing Street were due to announce the news but have been scooped.And, on the subject of the EnglandBelgium match, Theresa May suffered a bit of an ambush when she arrived in the room for the summit. The EU broadcasts a live feed as the leaders mingle in the room, with no sound, so we could watch what happened.As Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister, arrived, he opened a package and took out a football shirt which he offered to Theresa May. Watching the footage, it was not entirely clear from her reaction whether she realised at first what it was.With the number 10 on the back, it seemed an appropriate present. I’m told by those who follow these things that the number 10 shirt belongs to Eden Hazard, the Belgian star player.Some Belgian team scarfs appeared too, and Michel then posed for a picture with Xavier Bettel, the Luxembourg MP, and Mark Rutte, the Dutch PM.Sadly, no one from the Number 10 team seems to have brought any England scarfs to pass around. Perhaps they were worried that no one would want to wear one? Or perhaps it was just another case of the UK turning up at an EU negotiation empty handed?UPDATE: I’ve corrected the post above to say it was Xavier Bettel in the picture, not Leo Varadkar as I wrongly said earlier.Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, gave the most extensive of the Brexit-related doorstep interviews on the way in. We’ve covered some of his comments already, but here is a full summary.We did expect that we would make more progress - or any progress, really - we expected there would be progress at this summit in June, like there was in March and December. And there hasn’t been. So I will be saying to Prime Minister May we all need to intensify our efforts now. All of us want there to be a deal. We need a deal. Europe needs a deal, Britain needs a deal too.We in Europe, the 27 states, are willing to be more flexible. But in order to to be flexible the United Kingdom needs to soften some of its red lines.There are things that we just can’t compromise on the four freedoms, the four freedoms and the single market have to go together. You can’t have one freedom or two freedoms or three and a half freedoms, because if we were ever to agree to that, the European Union would start to break up, and that is something that we can’t ever contemplate.I think it would have been helpful if they had that white paper two years ago. You would have thought that before people voted to leave the European Union they would have had an idea what the new relationship might look like. But I appreciate that has not happened. But we look forward to seeing that white paper.We’re two years telling people it can’t be cherry picking, it can’t be cake and eat it. So it needs to understand that we’re a union of 27 member states, 500m people. We have laws and rules and principles and they can’t be changed for any one country, even a great country like Britain.Any relationship that exists in the future between the EU and the UK isn’t going to be one of absolute equals. We are 27 member states the UK is one country. We’re 500m people the UK is 60m. So that basis fact needs to be realised and understood.As we agreed back in December and March, there can be no withdrawal agreement without an agreement on the Irish backstop.I am here in Brussels in Belgium, so of course I’m going to be cheering for the home team. But of course if Belgium wins, England will probably get an easier ride in the next round. So perhaps it’s one of those winwin scenarios. Theresa May’s claim that the UK and the EU have made “very good progress” in the Brexit talks was flatly contradicted by what Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said when he arrived at the summit a few minutes earlier. He said:We did expect that we would make more progress - or any progress, really - we expected there would be progress at this summit in June, like there was in March and December. And there hasn’t been. So I will be saying to Prime Minister May we all need to intensify our efforts now. All of us want there to be a deal. We need a deal. Europe needs a deal, Britain needs a deal too.Varadkar did not personalise his criticism of the UK, but it was clear that he felt London, not Brussels, was to blame for the lack of progress. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, in his remarks to journalists said splits in the British cabinet over Brexit were a problem. (See 1.59am.)Theresa May is arriving at the EU summit now.She starts by talking about the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons vote yesterday, which the UK led, she says.She then claims there has been “very good progress” on the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Both sides want a strong future partnership, she says.She says she wants both sides to continue with the talks “at a faster pace”.Asked if the talks are really going well, she replies:We have been setting out throughout these negotiations our position and at every stage, last December and March, we have come to agreements with the European Union.She says the cabinet will be coming together next week to finalise the white paper on Brexit. Asked if she is annoyed by how rigid the EU is being, she says the UK has already been able to get “flexibility from the European Union” on matters.This is not just about the UK, she says. It matters for both sides.Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has arrived. He said Theresa May should relax her Brexit red lines. This is from my colleague Lisa O’Carroll.I will post the full quotes soon.EU leaders have been talking to journalists as they arrive at the summit in Brussels. Mostly they have been talking about migration, but the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte (who speaks good English, meaning the British journos can ask him questions) has spoken about Brexit. Here are the main points he made.I don’t want to talk in apocalyptic terms. What I want to say is that I believe the first, second and third priority now is to solve this issue of the Irish border. And when that is solved so many other issues will be easier to discuss. The first issue on the table now to solve is this problem of the Irish border. That is crucial. And there has to be a backstop which is not temporary, which is continuous, in case we are not able to solve this problem in future. And that issue has to be solved.The UK’s plan for a backstop is time limited, because this is something Brexiters are insisting on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aafc7cd4ea4845e7bc09bcf2e939ab1b3dc5f02f/103_227_4456_2674/master/4456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b539168e675d0e557922ab29a32dec5","title":"age 105 then youve a better chance of living even longer","story":"Study suggests that death rates level off at this age threshold, but fuels fierce debate whether humans are approaching upper life limitIt’s considered an inescapable fact of life: the older you get, the more likely death becomes. But new research suggests that the chances of dying may level off – at least for those who make it to 105 years old.The study found that death rates, which rise exponentially in adulthood, begin to decelerate after 80 years old and appear to eventually plateau, or even decline slightly, after the age of 105. By that point, the chances of passing away in a given year are approximately 50-50.“It’s the equivalent of tossing a coin each year,” said Prof Jim Vaupel, a specialist in ageing at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany and one of the authors.The findings add fuel to an unusually hostile debate between two camps of scientists, who are locked in an escalating dispute about whether humans are approaching their upper limit in terms of life. The latest paper, from Vaupel’s team who argue there is no evidence of a looming longevity limit, is based on data tracking the survival trajectories of almost 4,000 Italians older than 105 between 2009 and 2015. And they believe it bolsters their position. The latest study is not the first to tackle the question of what trajectory the human mortality curve takes for those who survive into extreme old age. However, previous efforts were hindered by small sample sizes and a failure to meticulously check birth records. “Age exaggeration is common among the oldest old”, according to the analysis in the journal Science. One explanation for the result is purely statistical: those who die in a certain age group in a given year tend to be the frailest. The following year, the survivors are one year older, but they are also relatively stronger and healthier. “Eventually the two factors, the ageing and the weeding out, counterbalance each other,” said Vaupel.Biological factors may also play a role. Cancer, for instance, becomes less common in the oldest people alive, which some have put down to a slow-down in cell ision in this age range. “Cancer is quite a common cause of death for people in their 70s, 80s or 90s,” said Vaupel. “But very few people die from cancer over 100.”Similar mortality plateaus are observed in a range of other species, including fruit flies and nematode worms, which the scientists said could hint at a common evolutionary explanation. Other animals, including certain fish and tree species, follow the reverse pattern, with the chances of death lessening for each year alive as they continue to grow in size.The oldest human to have lived, according to official records, was Jeanne Calment, a French woman who died at the age of 122 years in 1997. Some claim the fact that this record has not been broken, despite an expanding pool of centenarians, is evidence that humans cannot live much beyond this age. And the latest findings appear to have escalated the ongoing debate.“It seems rather far-fetched that after increasing exponentially, the chance of dying should suddenly stop in its tracks,” said Jan Vijg, a geneticist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Vijg previously published a paper in Science’s competitor journal, Nature, suggesting that the human species has hit its maximum shelf-life that prompted five separate teams to submit critiques of the work. “I do not consider the evidence for a plateau presented in this paper to be especially strong,” Vijg added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f466539b066508dfe19db8e18e5e0bf7fb5cca9d/0_433_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12f12562f0b8af054626865df3d5957b","title":"united nations tory record poverty human rights","story":"Expert who angered Donald Trump to look into impact of budget cuts The United Nations has launched an investigation into poverty and human rights in the UK which will examine the impact of the austerity policies of Theresa May and David Cameron over the past eight years.The inquiry will be led by Prof Philip Alston, the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, who angered the Donald Trump administration this month when he concluded after a similar visit to the US that the White House’s contempt for the poor was driving “cruel policies”.The fact-finding trip is scheduled for this autumn and will be the first visit to a western European country by a representative of the UN’s rapporteur’s office since a trip to Ireland in 2011. Alston’s most recent inquiries into extreme poverty have taken him to the US, China, Saudi Arabia and Ghana.“The UK has gone through a period of pretty deep budget cuts first under the coalition and then the Conservatives and I am interested to see what the outcome of that has been,” Alston told the . “I am also interested to look at what seems to be a renewed debate on all sides about the need to increase spending at least for some of the key programmes.”He said the challenges facing the UK were different to the US, where he has concluded Trump’s policies were “tailor-made to maximise inequality and to plunge millions of working Americans, and those unable to work, into penury”.Alston said: “In the UK, things are at a different place where there is no great budget surplus to be mobilised. Welfare cuts have taken place but there is now an interesting debate on whether they have gone too far and what measures need to be taken to shore up the NHS and other programmes.”Alston has not yet determined exactly what he will focus on and will shortly invite submissions from groups who want to suggest matters for him to consider. They could include housing squalour, insecurity at work, in-work poverty, mental health and political disenfranchisement. Alston will arrive as survivors and residents continue to give evidence to the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster. Many have said they felt their views and needs were ignored or marginalised by the local authority.“Poverty is often characterised by a lack of political power, by a difficulty in enjoying even basic civil and political rights,” said Alston.The Institute for Fiscal Studies this month found that people with longstanding mental health problems in the UK were more than twice as likely to be in poverty as those without a longstanding health problem. Destitution, however, has fallen over the past two years, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, although there are fears that the universal credit scheme could reverse those gains. Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said Alston would see a changed picture of poverty in the UK. “Twenty years ago, poverty in Britain was concentrated among pensioners and workless households,” he said. “Now poverty has moved into the workplace with more than half of the children growing up in poverty in working households.”Meghan Campbell, the deputy director of the Oxford Human Rights Hub, cited Brexit as a looming issue because employment protections were threatened by withdrawal from the European Union. She said rising costs of child and elderly care would particularly affect the ability of women to be economically independent. Alston said: “No one is suggesting the conditions in the UK are those of a poor developing country, but every rich country, as my mission to the US showed, has pockets of poverty everywhere. “The government statistics and a erse array of civil society organisations would suggest the UK does have important challenges dealing with poverty.”The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, welcomed Alston’s plan to consider the impact of austerity.“Austerity is a political choice made by Tory-led governments that cut spending on vital public services whilst, at the same time, handing out tax giveaways for giant corporations and the super-rich,” he said. “Only last year, a separate UN investigation concluded that Tory spending cuts trampled on the human rights of disabled people, whilst the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecasts child poverty to hit record levels in the next few years.”Previous UN missions to the UK have been highly controversial. In 2013, Raquel Rolnik, the UN rapporteur on housing, proposed the government suspend cuts to what it calls the spare room subsidy but is widely known as the bedroom tax and affects residents of social housing with spare rooms. Her report was dismissed as “a Marxist diatribe” by the then housing minister Kris Hopkins.Alston is an Australian international human rights law expert currently based at New York University. When he toured the US, he studied homelessness on Skid Row in Los Angeles, poverty in African-American areas in Alabama and the stricken coal country of West Virginia. He has been a UN rapporteur since 2004 and has specialised in extreme poverty and human rights for the past four years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7478851802bcdd6443f0abb22875b9e6dd1a2bda/754_32_2607_1564/master/2607.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f83da468b61ba721cee4bfd2fe878d0","title":"ben stokes return england batsmen india","story":"Ben Stokes will return from injury next week to make a rare appearance for Durham and thus create a selection logjam in England’s powerhouse batting lineup for white-ball cricket.The all-rounder is due to play his county’s T20 Blast fixture at Yorkshire on Thursday as a batsman following a month out with a hamstring tear and, if his bowling progresses in the nets, he could then be in contention for the third Twenty20 international against India in Bristol on 8 July.The opener against Virat Kohli’s side takes place at Old Trafford on Tuesday and the second in Cardiff three days later. With Paul Farbrace, the interim head coach, confirming a fully fit Stokes remains a shoo-in, the top six will be scrambling for spots despite a 5-0 one-day whitewash of Australia and the 28-run pasting in the one-off Twenty20 on Wednesday.“Stokes is a three-in-one player,” said Farbrace, who is in charge while Trevor Bayliss takes 10 days of downtime. “He can bowl and he is the best fielder so you are going to bring him in as soon as he is available.”While Joe Root is England’s sole batsman in the top 10 of the ODI world rankings and their leading centurion since the last World Cup with seven (during which time he averages 59), the Test captain may appear the vulnerable man in a T20 side he has just returned to after two years of being largely rested in the format.His game is less power-based than others and though a 24-ball 34 at No 5 at Edgbaston on Wednesday was a handy strike-rate, only a couple of his four fours convinced in a scampering innings. A slow start of seven from eight balls was in contrast to form-rich Jonny Bairstow batting at No 6 and clearing the rope first ball. Bairstow faced only seven more and looked wasted so low down.Jos Buttler, Jason Roy and Eoin Morgan, the captain and another six-hitter, appear undroppable and Alex Hales, the expected fall guy for Stokes in the one-day side, is in form. But Farbrace insists Root is a first-choice player given England still need an element of adaptability and craft in their line-up when the situation dictates.Fielding, Farbrace said, could well dictate who misses out when Stokes returns and thus Hales, who blasted a 24-ball 49 from No 4 at Edgbaston, appears most in need of an unequivocal statement across the next two matches. It is a situation he is also facing in the one-day side despite his 147 during the men’s world-record 481 for six in Nottingham.Such an abundance of riches, underlined by Dawid Malan missing out altogether despite four half-centuries and a strike-rate of 150 in his first five T20 internationals, is clearly a welcome problem. But it will test the man management skills of Morgan, Bayliss and Farbrace, as well as of the national selector, Ed Smith, before the 50-over World Cup next year.After trouncing Australia six times in a row and leaving their head coach, Justin Langer, describing an innings in the field against England’s batsmen as “a walk into the jungle”, Morgan’s side face a step up in class when India arrive. There are no plans to experiment or rotate in the Twenty20 games or the three‑match one-day series that follows.Kohli’s team take on Ireland in their second Twenty20 at Malahide on Friday, having breezed to a 76-run over their hosts on Wednesday despite a slightly rusty fielding performance in which three catches went down.As well as having a muscular batting lineup of their own, India’s bowlers will provide a greater threat to England than Australia, with the wrist-spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal described by Kohli as his “X Factor” men in the middle overs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3707d2665141cff848276065eecf63c325c0ebf1/0_190_5552_3332/master/5552.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68a33d5892fb01a09ce772d0a1474c61","title":"lewis hamilton mercedes technology championship push","story":"Lewis Hamilton believes Mercedes are in a stronger position than ever to enhance his Formula One world championship advantage at the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday.Hamilton, who leads Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel by 14\u0026nbsppoints, is optimistic he can extend it because of the aerodynamic updates his team have brought to the Red Bull Ring.Hamilton won the French Grand Prix last Sunday in which Vettel finished fifth after colliding with Hamilton’s teammate Valtteri Bottas at the first corner. It resulted in a 15-point swing in Hamilton’s favour.Mercedes had brought their new, upgraded engine to France, one race later than Ferrari had introduced their power unit in Canada. The extra time allowed the team to improve the new specification to a greater extent than had been intended.Hamilton has won only once in Austria since its grand prix returned to the calendar in 2014 but is hopeful of a better return this weekend. Mercedes have brought their first major aerodynamic upgrade to Spielberg and in a season that is likely to be decided by a highly competitive development battle, it could prove to be a crucial.“The development race is always tight and up until now, we haven’t had a lot of development parts on the car,” Hamilton said. “I’m aware the guys are working harder and harder to ensure we bring quality rather than quantity, so it’s great to see some new bits this weekend. I’m excited to try them on track. I know how hard everyone is working back at the factory to make sure we bring the good stuff. It will undoubtedly help us.”Hamilton is conscious his fight with Vettel is finely balanced and is maintaining his focus on the difference he can make. “I just think about how can I get the car in the right ballpark so I can do what I do. Hopefully the developments will help me do it more,” he said, while acknowledging that qualifying would be key. “Everyone has some sort of upgrades. I anticipate it being one of the closest qualifying sessions we’ve had this season. That’s my feeling.”The changes are focused largely on the Mercedes’ side pods and the rear wing and represent a strong push to steal a march on Ferrari.With the following grand prix at Silverstone, where Hamilton has been dominant with four wins from the past four races, extending his lead further at the Red Bull Ring would put him in a commanding position going into the final European races, where he has traditionally been strong.The four-times world champion has been critical of the difficulty to overtake that the current generation of cars present but said the sport is heading in the right direction but that greater competition at the front remained key as F1 considers new regulations for 2021.“Karting is wheel-to-wheel racing. That’s what got me invested in racing and really caught my heart, it’s where the passion is,” Hamilton said. “That’s what I want. I want F1 to continue to be moving in this direction, and more teams involved, and everyone getting closer and closer. I feel that means the difference I can make in the sport can be seen more, I can utilise it more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b0c52bfb55f5615257d1b484cf6646fb1843f99/0_127_3488_2094/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e1afd35bd2f8f460aa4ce63188b071","title":"england v new zealand womens t20 international live","story":"6th over: England 43-2 (Taylor 20, Sciver 8) Target 130 After two singles, Sciver steps deep into her crease and clumps Watkin through the covers for four not so easy after all, this international cricket. Two more singles follow, and England are chugging along nicely now. “I think changing the women’s game away from the men’s (smaller pitches, smaller balls - the women’s balls are, or used to be, lighter in any case) is not productive”, reckons Ravi Nair. “The strength is coming, as it has done in the batting.”I’m no expert but I’m not sure about this - batting can be helped with kit, and is also a lot about timing. Maybe bowling is about whip more than strength, I’m not sure, but the pace will never be as intense with a 22-yard track. 5th over: England 35-2 (Taylor 18, Sciver 2) Target 130 A single apiece, then Taylor decides it’s time. She top-edges a reverse for two, then flicks one off her legs, misfielded by Amelia Kerr. New Zealand will be desperate to break this partnership because the combined knowhow is enough to power a city. 4th over: England 22-2 (Taylor 11, Sciver 1) Target 130 Taylor pushes to long on and dashes through for a second run. Three singles follow, which will do England, their current run rate 6.75 and the required rate 6.43. But these two will do well to play sensibly - I’m sure they will - because that’ll be enough, despite the temptation to blaze it out of sight. There does not seem to be much prospect of an unplayable delivery. What a start for Watkin! Again, it’s not a great ball so Beaumont is entitled to go for it, but given the low total, was it necessary? She doesn’t middle her drive, and is easily caught at mid off. 3rd over: England 22-1 (Beaumont11, Taylor 7) Target 130 Jensen into the attack, and Taylor wastes no time in welcoming her, reverse-sweeping her loosener for four. a single then follows before Beaumont cracks down the ground for four. She’s picking length so well, and when she goes, she’s not leaving anything out. “Ouch,” tweets Ravi Nair. “Wyatt’s relatively poor run with the bat continues. She is so good, or has been over the last year, that I hope she gets over this quickly. We need her at her best.”Joy of playing in a good team, I guess. You can fail a few times because your mates will sort you out. Fail in a struggling one and you’re out as soon as you’re in. 2nd over: England 12-1 (Beaumont 6, Taylor 2) Target 130 Back on the smaller pitch point, another idea offered is a smaller ball, which will do more off the pitch and be especially helpful for spinners, an activity much aided by large hands - and kids. Anyway, Taylor gets off the mark with a single, Beaumont adds one, Taylor responds, and then Beaumont cracks a cut for the first boundary of the innings. Beaumont is looking so confident, as you’d expect of someone having the summer she’s having. Watkin gets a wicket with her first ball! It’s not a very good one, right in the slot for Wyatt, but she doesn’t get under it so though she cracks it hard enough, Bates is able to take a very useful high catch at mid off. 1st over: England 5-0 (Wyatt 2, Beaumont 1) Target 130 Rowe will open, and Wyatt immediately drives her for one, then Beaumont slices across one which doesn’t quite carry to Devine at point. Wyatt then drives to mid off and they scramble a single - direct hit and she’s struggling - before consecutive leg-side wides make this a useful start. The required rate is 6.57. Right, the players are back with us - here we go! “Huzzah!” returns Ravi Nair. “A stumping, a catch, a run out, an lbw (four actually) and now a bowled. A full hand of the major dismissal methods.”Aaaaaas I was just about to say, of course. Can’t believe we missed out on a hit ball twice. “Sorry, this match is too exciting for me to tweet anything clever or insightful at you,” excuses Ravi Nair. “Is the pitch misbehaving? I’d have thought it would be dry and, at most, a touch dusty.”Yes, it’s a little slow and dry, but the outfield is sharp. England caught brilliantly there, far better than in much of this series. The bowling was good rather than great, but with Suzie Bates gone in the first over, that was plenty for New Zealand - Sophie Devine batted really well, her partnership with Amy Satterthwaite the only time New Zealand got on top, but once that was done, England did a fine job of keeping her off strike, and would expect to chase down 130 pretty much every time. Sophie Devine will not be the first women to carry her bat in a T20 international ... but what a catch it takes to ruin it for her! Seeing wickets tumble while she stands at the wrong end, she heaves to square leg and gets a good piece of it, but running around the rope, Sciver floats into a perfectly-timed leap, snaffling the snaffle and that’s that! Three wickets for Shrubsole, not enough runs for New Zealand. 18th over: New Zealand 129-9 (Devine 50, Jensen 0) New Zealand are well short here, failing a monstrous finish. England have done a fantastic job starving Devine of the strike, such that her partners feel obliged to whack. Broadmore, who has only faced one ball, makes room, misses, and Brunt clatters her off peg with a cross-seamer. Devine hit to midwicket and Wyatt gathered, throwing to the bowler’s end where Brunt grabbed very well to break the stumps. Bezeidenhout’s e was a good one but they went upstairs and gone she was - though Wyatt was rebuked by Brunt for looping in on the full instead of chucking hard on the bounce. 17th over: New Zealand 127-7 (Devine 50, Bezuidenhout 6) Three singles and then Bezuidenhout comes well out of her crease to glance four through third man - that was very nicely done. Two more singles follow, and that’s the nine off the over that New Zealand need to get a par-ish total. 16th over: New Zealand 118-7 (Devine 47, Bezuidenhout 0) Two wickets off the over, and that might prove to be when the match turned irrevocably towards England. Rowe goes down on one knee to hump across the line but there’s no width to facilitate that. So she misses, Hazell hits, and she’s on her bike. It’s all collapsing around Devine, who desperately needs to get herself on strike. Heather Knight brings cover up so Kerr is forced to sweep when she needed to drive. She misses, takes it on the pad, and there she goes. 16th over: New Zealand 118-5 (Devine 47, Kerr 5) Kerr’s only 19 but she knows how to hit the thing and helps herself to four through midwicket from the first ball of Hazell’s spell. 15th over: New Zealand 114-5 (Devine 47, Kerr 1) Kerr takes a single, then Devine hammers four to square leg. It’s not all on her, but it’s maionly on her. Sarah Taylor is a genius, what more do you want to know. Sciver sends down a wide, Watkin chases it, and as she moves Taylor already knows what’s coming next, anticipating the miss and whipping off the bails for the 50th stumping of her career. 15th over: New Zealand 109-4 (Devine 43, Watkin 16) Both sides are nicely set as Nat Sciver has a turn and after Devine adds one, Watkin goes again. She gets two into the off side then looks to go over the top to square leg ... but George is underneath it ... but she misjudges it and finishes short. 14th over: New Zealand 103-4 (Devine 42, Watkin 12) Ecclestone returns and Watkin looks to have a zetz immediately, missing the first ball and almost missing the second. But then she moves right across to leg and gives herself plenty of room to sweep four to deep backward stands and delivers, whacking through cover for four twinkles down the ground, lifting four over midwicket! That is a proper showreel of shots and a lesson in how to play SLA. You can tell a team’s condition by its catching, and this is a ripper! Green goes down the ground, but Jones comes around from long on, sets herself, and es to take a tumbler! Brilliant! 13th over: New Zealand 91-3 (Devine 42, Green 2) Shrubsole returns and is milked for five singles...Katie George has her first wicket for England! Satterthwaite heaves across the line once too often, misses, and is plumb. Still, 15 off the over and Devine is still in the middle. 12th over: New Zealand 86-2 (Devine 39, Satterthwaite 37) Heather Knight wants a wicket so hands George the ball, who directs fielders around the park then delivers a wide followed by width her second delivery is duly carted over extra cover for four before a single brings Satterthwaite on strike, also raising the 50 partnership. There’s not that much wrong with what comes next - I guess it’s a bit full - and Devine deals with it, driving four. So George tries a slower ball, into the pitch, and somehow Devine, with one hand, forces it over mid off after which it trickles over the fence. So England put out a deep midwicket and Devine cuts a single...11th over: New Zealand 71-2 (Devine 30, Satterthwaite 32) Yes they can! Ecclestone is back on. But in the meantime Hazell continues and I wonder if New Zealand might look to make hay if Devine starts getting involved England have a problem, and there she goes, driving four over the bowler’s head with consummate ease and impeccable technique. Ecclestone then saves three with a e, another single follows it, and this is nicely set up for both thrash and contest. 10th over: New Zealand 64-2 (Devine 25, Satterthwaite 30) Satterthwaite swipes across the line and gets two to backward square, then cracks Brunt back over her head for a one-bounce four to long on. This is excellent batting, this, is this, this is, considered risks and committing to shots. Two more come to long on, the two singles and a leg bye - England need a wicket, and can’t call upon its likeliest provider. Stokes will only play as a batsman in that first match. 9th over: New Zealand 53-2 (Devine 25, Satterthwaite 20) In commentary, they’re discussing whether the pitch in women’s cricket should be shortened, and I can see the sense. Women’s reactions are every bit as good as men’s, but they can’t bowl as fast, so such a change would add that element. The problem, though, is practical - where would these pitches be? If they’re shared with men, are there going to be footmarks in strange places? Two twos and two ones from the over, and this is now a partnership. As such, England bring back Brunt...8th over: New Zealand 43-2 (Devine 22, Satterthwaite 17) Can New Zealand take advantage of the situation? Knight brings herself on and immediately there’s an appeal for lb, but the ball looked to pitch outside. Devine then pinches a single before Satterthwaite pulls two to square leg, reverse-sweeps four, and then gives a full toss what it deserves, helping it around the corner to the fine leg fence. 11 from the over and New Zealand are starting to move. Ecclestone looks ok but is helped off, and Jenny Gun replaces her. Gosh, Sophie Ecclestone has gone down and looks in a lot of trouble. She came in to field, threw the ball back, and as she turned to return to her spot, the ankle turned slightly. The physio is on attending to her. 7th over: New Zealand 36-2 (Devine 21, Satterthwaite 7) Hazell’s off breaks arrive, and after Satterthwaite takes a single, Devine drives back at her hard ... Hazell gets down to it, but can’t quite get her hands to it. Tough chance, but a chance nonetheless, as we see that second appeal for lb was out. Four singles from the over. 6th over: New Zealand 32-2 (Devine 19, Satterthwaite 5) Ecclestone nails Satterthwaite first ball with one going on with the arm ... it hits the pad and looks good to me, but the umpire says no. So Satterthwaite opts to attack, dragging the next delivery from outside off to the square leg fence, and adds a single thereafter. Ecclestone is in the zone. Four wickets last time out, her second delivery is quick and straight, so Martin looks to pull and misses, taking it on the hip. The finger is quickly applied and New Zealand are in a situation. 5th over: New Zealand 26-1 (Devine 18, Martin 8) Shrubsole returns and immediately serves one on the pads, clipped to backward square with minimum effort and maximum prejudice. A dot follows, but then a lovely drive to wide long on adds four more asingle is all that the final three deliveries of the over yield, but England will already be fancying the back of Devine, who’s seeing it. Nine from the over.4th over: New Zealand 17-1 (Devine 9, Martin 8) George continues, as Mark Butcher muses on the decent score, settling on the average in women’s internationals, 162. Anyway, Devine swats one to wide mid off, then Martin smears four to square leg - she chucked everything at that and was duly rewarded.3rd over: New Zealand11-1 (Devine 8, Martin 4) Brunt takes over from Shrubsole - I think we know what she thinks about dead rubbers, i.e. there’s no such thing. Martin takes her first ball for two down the ground, and after adding a single to square leg, cuts beautifully through point - she was cramped but still managed to get the ball away. A single then follows, and that’s much better from New Zealand. 2nd over: New Zealand 4-1 (Devine 3, Martin 1) 19-year-old Katie George opens from the other end, and what’s this?! Sarah Taylor misses another chance and this one was a legit drop! Devine, cramped, tries to hit her way out of trouble, and this one’s a routine edge that somehow doesn’t stick! Even geniuses are fallible! George, meanwhile, is charging in and the left-arm angle is proving hard to get away so far. Two singles are all the over yields, though Beaumont had to make a decent stop on the long on fence to save a boundary. 1st over: New Zealand 2-1 (Devine 1, Martin 0) The batters crossed, so Devine nudges another single. England get the biggun right away! Bates is in great nick, so when Shrubsole gives her one on the pads she goes after it, hoisting to deep square leg without quite getting all of it, and after the crowd falls silent, Amy Jones hangs on ing forward. That cannot have been a pleasant experience. 1st over: New Zealand 1-0 (Devine 1, Bates 0) Devine has a fence at Shrubsole’s leg-cutter, imparting an edge ... enough of one to beat even Sarah Taylor. Bates then middles one beautifully, only to pick out Ecclestone at mid off...The pitch, apparently, is dry, which will help Sophie Ecclestone, England’s left-arm spinner. New Zealand will need to get after her, or at least not give it away against her, if they’re to win. It’s just so hard to look beyond England’s confidence, though, which is why it’s hard to complacency creeping in though this game doesn’t have meaning beyond itself itself is plenty. Incidentally - well, not really incidentally - New Zealand’s win earlier today was powered by Suzie Bates, who scored 62, and Sophie Devine who scored 68 not out. The question now is are their eyes in, or are they tired? Strange old thing, these double-headers and not really fair regardless of the answer. England, meanwhile, make one change from Monday’s hiding of ... New Zealand: George replaces Farrant. New Zealand make three changes from this afternoon’s match, all of them down the order: out go Petersen, Kasperek and Tahuhu in come Rowe, Bezuidenhout and Watkin. I doubt England mind too much. They have the firepower to chase down any total, and it’s getting dark so late these days that the dusk is unlikely to be much of a factor. Earlier today, New Zealand mashed up South Africa, chasing down 148 in 15.2 overs. That took both them and England into Sunday’s final. Morning everyone. For the best part of a generation, it was tennis with a bit of MMA until recently it was darts and now, it might just be women’s cricket. I’m talking, of course, about the most exciting sport in the world, by which I mean played to the highest standard relative to itself and competitive as possible at the top. The best teams are all good enough to beat one another, all are improving rapidly, and all are playing the game with joy and fire ... things are good.But, for now at least, there is still a hierarchy, and England are just about at its top. These teams will meet in Sunday’s final regardless of what happens today, though do not expect them to ease off that is not what is done, and there is smack to be laid down. There will be no mucking about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e21f89aaa7d8f3815cbdddb3b18f3d222b0e09f/0_114_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c1db86899d4047820e016aa7dca5b8d","title":"waterside pubs uk readers travel tips","story":"On canals, coast and riverbanks, readers pick their favourite pubs for a drink in the sunshine while taking in the action – or lack of it – on the waterWaterside pubs are an amazing link with the past on the UK’s 3,000 miles of canals.

It’s in the Curdworth flight at Bodymoor Heath, and is the only sanctuary for tired narrowboaters leaving Birmingham and finding themselves on this stretch of canal. The foods is pretty standard and cheap, the beer too, and the service is unique to this part of the country (indeed, when my friend accidentally ordered drinks to the wrong tab, the landlady corrected his mistake by shouting: “Oy, come here you little sh*t”).

The show, billed as “an adult fantasy about a crumbling medieval kingdom known as Dreamland”, marks Groening’s first new project in nearly two decades, since Futurama premiered in 1999.The 10-episode series, which is also Groening’s first production away from Fox, stars Broad City’s Abbi Jacobson as a boozy princess named Bean, flanked by her sidekicks Elfo, voiced by Nat Faxon, and Luci, played by the comic Eric Andre. There are seasoned voice actors involved, too, including Futurama’s John DiMaggio, Billy West, Maurice LaMarche, David Herman, Tress MacNeille, Jeny Batten, Rich Fulcher, Noel Fielding and Lucy Montgomery.“In Disenchantment, viewers will be whisked away to the crumbling medieval kingdom of Dreamland, where they will follow the misadventures of hard-drinking young princess Bean, her feisty elf companion Elfo and her personal demon Luci,” reads the official summary for Disenchantment. “Along the way, the oddball trio will encounter ogres, sprites, harpies, imps, trolls, walruses and lots of human fools.”Although the teaser, which runs a brief 45 seconds, gives away little of the show’s plot, it does reference Groening’s past work, which has nabbed him 12 Emmy awards including 10 for The Simpsons. “You’ve seen the future in Futurama, you’ve seen the present in Springfield,” says the voiceover. “So, what’s the obvious third move? The past, of course.”In a statement last summer, Groening described the show, which has been picked up for 20 episodes, as a show “about life and death, love and sex, and how to keep laughing in a world full of suffering and idiots, despite what the elders and wizards and other jerks tell you”.Disenchantment, which will be available on Netflix on 17 August, will be co-executive-produced by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, frequent collaborators of Groening’s.

But how long should a show go on for? We crunch the numbers …Or is it? The second season has already been criticised as “torture porn”. Episode one featured kicking, electrocution with cattle prods, being burned on a gas stove, and having urine dumped over people standing on the gallows. At the present rate, it’s hard to know where the dystopia could end up by season 10, except a real life version of Clockwork Orange’s Ludovico technique.History is littered with such examples of shows that went on too long. (And, ever so occasionally, ones that didn’t go on long enough.) So what is the perfect number of seasons? To figure that out, we have put some of the most memorably under-over shows of modern times through an exhaustive statistical analysis.When Fox pulled the plug on AD in 2006, the wailing was unending. Where would Tobias have taken his Blue Man Group if only he had had the chance? Would Michael Cera look creepy when grew out of his puppy fat? And what might have happened to a ridiculous far-fetched idea like The Wall? When Netflix exhumed the show’s corpse in 2013, the answers came. Another four years after that, a fifth is with us.But, even on a show constantly recapping itself, by Season five it has become hard to recall why these characters started down the arcs they have ended up on. We have come up not against the limits of the scriptwriters’ ingenuity, but the capacity of ordinary viewers to recall all the whimsical plot points that make up any given gag.Number of seasons:Percentage it went too long for:Therefore, how many seasons are enough seasons?What-ifs don’t come much bigger than: “What if Ricky Gervais had kept on doing the thing he was great at?” In fact, it sounds like a premise for his next terrible film.

Addressing the Bundestag before heading to Brussels, the German chancellor said European leaders should find a solution to asylum challenges “by allowing ourselves to be guided by values and rooting for multilateralism rather than unilateralism”.If the heads of government gathering in Brussels failed to do so, Merkel warned, they risked creating a situation where “no one believes in the value system that has made us so strong”.Migration is dominating the EU summit in Brussels, whose agenda has been dubbed by some insiders as Saving Private Merkel.Germany’s coalition government is under immense strain, after the hardline interior minister Horst Seehofer threatened to turn away any asylum claimants already registered in another EU country, unless Merkel came up with a solution by 1 July.Merkel fears that if Germany closes its borders it will set off a chain reaction that destroys Europe’s border-free travel zone, regarded by the EU as one of its greatest achievements, as well as a lynchpin of jobs and prosperity.The leaders of Spain, Finland and Luxembourg expressed support for Germany to curtail “secondary movement” of migrants who have made an asylum claim in another European country. “I understand when Germany says ‘why do we have to deal with everything?’” said Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel. The Spanish PM, Pedro Sánchez, said European solidarity on migration was vital, “especially with Germany which is now suffering a political crisis”.But Italy threatened to veto the summit agreement if it did not meet Rome’s demands for more help managing arrivals to its shores. European leaders are at odds over how to reform EU asylum policy, which is based on the principle that the first country of arrival takes responsibility for asylum claims. The system has put frontline states Italy, Greece and Spain under immense pressure, while Germany faces “secondary movements” of migrants, who may be seeking to speed up asylum claims.Greece said it was ready to help Germany by taking back asylum seekers, a political boost for Merkel, but one that does not solve her problem, as the numbers returning to Greece would be small.Merkel also needs help from Italy, but its new populist government wants European countries to share the burden of looking after the migrants arriving on its shores. Since Italy began turning away migrant rescue boats from its ports, Europe’s isions over migration have burst into the open.After days adrift in international waters, the German NGO ship Lifeline, carrying 234 people, has now been allowed to dock at Malta. The Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, announced that nine European countries, including Malta, had agreed to accept people rescued at sea.European leaders are likely to sidestep the isive issue of refugee quotas that has roiled the EU since 2015, when Brussels attempted to force through mandatory quotas.Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who was recently re-elected after a harsh anti-immigration campaign, made clear his country would not be welcoming refugees. In typically uncompromising language, he said the EU had to stop migrants arriving. “The invasion should be stopped and to stop the invasion means to have a strong border.”Faultlines over managing internal migration means EU leaders will focus on action to prevent migrants arriving in Europe, a policy that commands consensus. EU leaders are expected to call for migrant processing centres to be set up in north African countries, but details remain sketchy.The rightwing Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said that “being rescued in the Mediterranean must not automatically become a ticket to central Europe”.“We are not ready for the next crisis,” Rutte said, adding that it was not right that countries such as Spain and Italy were left to shoulder all the burden. The EU needed to decide “how to kill the business model of cynical boat smugglers, people dying in the migration sea” he said.Questions persist about the proposed migrant processing centres, which no African country has agreed to host. The EU will call for further study of “regional disembarkation platforms”, a vague term for a scheme that EU officials admit is lacking detail.Merkel, the architect of the EU-Turkey deal, told German MPs that it was time to seek conversations with African states about deals to return migrants “who absolutely have no right to stay”, modelled on the 2016 agreement.In a 26-minute speech to the German parliament, notably in Seehofer’s absence, Merkel sounded a note of pessimism about the chances of striking an EU-wide deal on migration. Throughout Merkel’s speech she was heckled by delegates of the rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland. At one point she interrupted her own speech with the words: “My God, seriously now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8724b834900b45f5f26d44733272bdbd315d23b/0_63_4949_2969/master/4949.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=935bce6ff3e5756ebc265ab1ed2763eb","title":"we need a paradigm shift in the way we think about migration","story":"Like climate change, migration is a global issue that needs to be addressed both locally and internationally. The regulation of population movements has long been a pitfall of international cooperation. The European asylum crisis of 2015 revealed that, even in highly integrated and cooperative contexts such as the EU, unpreparedness, political confusion and misinformation generate inadequate and humanly costly policy responses. At the global level, from the 1990 convention on migrant workers’ rights to the currently discussed “global compacts”, attempts to coordinate policies and foster global governance fell short of providing innovative and impactful solutions.The recent inflow of Syrian asylum seekers in Europe forced upon EU leaders and citizens a brutal awareness regarding the global refugee crisis that is mostly unfolding in the global south. This particular refugee inflow resonates with broader discussions on immigration, integration and ersity in European societies fragilised by the 2008 economic crisis. The current European crisis is made of the confusion of short- and long-term policy issues, of asylum and migration regulation, of debates around rights, politics and economics, which cannot be solely addressed at the national level.Beyond Europe, the emergence or entrenchment of political crises around migration and asylum issues calls for an urgent reaction of all stakeholders. Scientists, civil society organisations, activists, concerned citizens and policymakers must join forces to bring about a better understanding of migration, both forced and voluntary, of its determinants and consequences for host societies and countries of origin. By doing so, we will provide grounds for evidence-based policymaking and sound practices beyond ideological constructions and discourses that obfuscate debates in the media and political arena today.This call for a change of approach has become urgent.• Migration and asylum policies in Europe and North America as well as other countries (Kenya, Saudi Arabia etc) have created unprecedented attacks on inidual human rights for mobile populations and on asylum rights.• Since the 1990s, attempts by the UN or regional organisations such as the EU to regulate migration and asylum have failed (The 1990 convention, the Dublin agreements in Europe, up to the global compacts) and collapsed when confronted by the trial of either refugee arrivals (Iraq, Syria, South Sudan, Burma) or political crises around migrants’ incorporation and ersity.The policy options adopted by OECD countries in the past decade – building walls, externalising control at high political and financial costs – will neither prevent people leaving their country, nor will it impact the determinants of migration in the long run as often repeated by scientists and shown by recent experiences.The lack of understanding of the impact of migration in host and receiving societies generates enduring mismanagement. Fearmongering discourses infuse policy agendas and ignores scientific knowledge. Although scientific controversies on migration and asylum do exist, some well-established facts remain unheard and unused in policymaking:• Migration mostly occurs within regions and not between continents. Migrants are mostly located in the global south, especially refugees.• Visa restrictions increase the settlement of immigrants already present in a host country: migrant workers stay instead of moving back and forth across countries. The absence of visa opportunities for asylum seekers in countries of origin and transit also increases criminal practices and smuggling.• Border closure not only restricts mobility but also exchanges and transfers of funds, knowhowand ideas across borders.• Rapid access to housing, education as well as the formal labour market increases the quality of incorporation of migrants and asylum seekers in host societies, further reducing inequalities and disenfranchisement.• The impact of migration on population trends is short-lived as fertility behaviours rapidly catch up with demographic patterns in host countries.• Financing development can increase emigration in poor countries, making the migration-development relations much more complex than what current policies present as grounds for action. The effect of immigrant inflows on labour market outcomes and national growth is neutral or positive overall, depending upon economic conditions and dynamics, upon workers’ mobility and labour market regulations.In understanding the impact of immigration, analyses that are both context-specific and connected to global dynamics are crucial to determine the effects of migration. Recent concern has been formulated about the lack or unreliable quality of migration data. Beyond data, we argue that robustness and clarity in the analytical premises of policymaking is the key to sound and efficient regulation of population movement. One-size-fits-all and ideology-based policies do not work.We therefore urge the ending of the short-term and inadequate political solutions that brought us to political and humanitarian crises. We ask for a radical change of paradigm in dealing with migration and asylum, based on a rational, realistic, scientifically informed and humanist approach. We thus call for an emergency meeting of scientists and experts to inform policymaking, and for the creation of an International Panel on Migration and Asylum.Virginie Guiraudon CNRS director of research, Sciences Po, Paris, Andrew Geddes Director, Migration Policy Centre, European University Institute, Italy, Steven Vertovec Director, Max Planck Institute, Germany, Jean Jouzel Founding member of the International Panel on Climate Change, Thomas Piketty Co-director, World Inequality Database, Paris and more than 500 others.

Photograph: John BreenIrish scientists have been asked to contribute to an international investigation of the global decline of bee populations by identifying the particular causes of stress which are wiping out many species.Pollination experts from Trinity College Dublin will be playing a central role in the €9 million project, funded under the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme, by working with farmers and beekeepers across Europe “to establish a baseline of what’s stressing bees in agricultural ecosystems”. Bees play a critical role in the foodchain, but are vulnerable to loss of flowers because they feed on nectar and pollen throughout their lives. Decline in populations in Ireland and across the globe has been accelerating in recent years, especially among native varieties. Of the 100 species of bees in Ireland a third are threatened with extinction.Pollinators face multiple threats including agrochemicals, pathogens, habitat loss and climate change, according to the TCD professor of botany, Jane Stout, who is leading the Irish input.The project, named Pan-European Assessment, Monitoring and Mitigation of Stressors on the Health of Bees (PoshBee), will run for five years. It aims to understand the impacts of multiple pressures on a range of bee species and develop new tools to help reduce risks and negative impacts, Ms Stout said. It is being co-ordinated by former TCD zoologist Prof Mark Brown, now at Royal Holloway University of London, and will bring together 42 partners from across Europe seven beekeeping associations eight farming organisations four companies and 23 academic and government research organisations.Prof Stout will direct researchers across eight European countries in conducting fieldwork to assess real levels of exposure that bees have to chemical, nutritional and pathogenic stressors. In Ireland, this work will be conducted in collaboration with Teagasc and the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations.“It’s thought that a combination of pressures, including agrochemicals, disease and loss of floral resources, which provide bees with their nutrition, is contributing to bee decline,” she said. “We are aiming to quantify this in the field . . . to try to establish exposure hazards, and ultimately develop tools, screening protocols, and practice- and policy-relevant outputs to local, national, European, and global stakeholders.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3547065.1530198131!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"night time water pressure reductions introduced in dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOn Wednesday, demand for water in Dublin  rose to  615 million litres, exceeding the production capacity by five million litres. Photograph: GettyWater pressure reductions have been introduced in Dublin following an increase of millions of litres in water usage despite conservation warnings from Irish Water.Dubliners are now using more water than can be produced each day, with the utility having to draw on its storage supplies to feed the capital.Irish Water can produce 610 million litres of water per day to serve the Dublin area. Last summer, an average of 565 million litres of water per day was used. This summer the average has risen to 585 million litres but last Friday 602 million litres of water was used and overnight on Monday the levels were at 609 million litres, leaving “almost no margin of supply over demand”, Irish Water said.On Tuesday demand fell to 603 million litres but the following day shot up to 615 million litres, exceeding the production capacity by five million litres.In response, Irish Water has said it has had to take steps to protect Dublin’s water supplies by reducing pressure at night time across the greater Dublin area. This is currently being done at a level that will not impact on businesses, it said, but it remains “very concerned” about the possibility of having to impose cuts in the long term.“Where restrictions are necessary we are endeavouring to do them at times that will have the minimal impact on homes and businesses,” Irish Water’s corporate affairs manager, Kate Gannon said. “Lowering the water pressure in Dublin is designed to save water without causing disruption to customers.”More severe restrictions could become “unavoidable” if the dry weather persists she said.“If the drought is prolonged, water restrictions would become unavoidable if demand does not continue to drop. Irish Water are appealing to the public to be continue to be mindful of their water usage.”Demand for water is increasing while levels in rivers and lakes are dropping significantly which means that is there is less water available to treat and then supply to homes and businesses.Nationally, Irish Water on Thursday identified 100 water supply schemes around the country that were now at risk.Customers in Kilkenny, Longford, Athlone, North Galway, Louth and Kerry have already experienced restricted water supply and outages in some cases. Currently almost 4,000 customers are impacted.Some areas in Cork, Wicklow, Limerick, Kilkenny, Carlow, Tipperary, Clare, Mayo, Sligo, Donegal, Galway, Roscommon, Laois, Limerick, Kerry, Waterford and Offaly have been identified as being at risk.Transport companies are moving to conserve water during the drought.Irish Rail said it is cutting back its train cleaning programme from every two days to “at most” once every four days at its maintenance locations at Fairview, Connolly, Heuston and Cork, which are served by Irish Water.. “We will assess the requirement on a case by case basis to see if this can be reduced further,” a spokesman said. However, normal train washing will continue at its depots at Drogheda, Portlaoise and Limerick which use purpose built wells that do not impact on the public water supply, he said.Luas operator Transdev said it already operates a water conservation programme which sees it only wash trains every three days, but is reassessing this schedule in light of the current water shortage.Dublin Bus has committed to only wash their fleet of buses every three days, instead of once a day, in an effort to save water.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3546984.1530193697!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"top tips for conserving water at home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHomes and businesses Dublin use on average 565 million litres a day, Irish Water said.* Stop running the tap when you brush your teeth, wash or shave. This will save as much as 20 litres of water a time – if there are four people in the house and you all brush your teeth twice a day you will save almost 200 litres every day.* A single flush of your toilet uses almost nine litres of water so only do it when absolutely necessary – you’ll be the best judge of when that is. Consider adding a brick to your toilet cistern. It will displace the water and reduce the amount it needs to get things moving.* Keep a jug of water in the fridge so you don’t have to run a tap to make your drinking water cool enough.* While baths are frowned upon in lean times, it does depend on the power of your shower and the length of time you spend in it. A typical bath uses about 150 litres of water while a six-minute shower will use about 60 litres.* Shower faster – you can get yourself clean in three minutes if you push yourself.* Use a basin or a plug stop in the kitchen.

Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReuters Many parts of the country could see record-breaking temperatures as the extremely hot weather continues for at least another two days.By 5pm on Thursday weather stations at Shannon Airport and Mount Dillon in Roscommon had recorded over 30 degrees for the second successive day.In Shannon Airport temperatures peaked at 31.5 degrees Celsius while in Mount Dillon it reached 30.3. Temperatures in Moore Park, Co Cork, Claremorris in Co Mayo and Athenry in Co Galway also hit 30 degrees Celsius.The warm weather is forecast to continue into the early days of next week however temperatures will not be as high as recent days. Much of the country has had temperatures in the high 20s creating a partial drought situation. The soil moisture deficit in the Leinster area is close to 80mms which means it would take that level of rainfall to return the soil to normal moisture levels.Fortunately, humidity is low which makes it easier for people to sleep at night. Met Éireann forecaster Siobhan Ryan said it was “unlikely” that the all-time record temperature for Ireland of 33.3 degrees recorded on June 26th, 1887 in Kilkenny would be surpassed.It is already shaping up to be one of the sunniest months on record. Some 98 hours of sunshine - almost three times the average - was recorded across the country in the week from Wednesday to Wednesday. It has become so hot that the AA has issued a warning to motorists to take care on tertiary roads became of melting tarmac. AA Roadwatch editor Arwen Foley said melting tar could stick to the wheels and attract a lot of debris which made it hazardous for driving. Several local authorities including Sligo and Donegal have issued warnings about melting tar. Irish Water said it was operating on a “knife edge” to keep supplies flowing during the prolonged dry weather and have urged the country to “pull together” to prevent taps running dry. In Dublin, pressure is being reduced at night time to protect supplies.Eamon Gallen, general manager of the utility, said demand in Dublin earlier this week reached a “very concerning” peak while Donegal, Galway, Limerick and Mullingar have been deemed as “high risk”. About 10,000 households were coping with restrictions or no water at all for periods, mostly in the Bennettsbridge area of Co Kilkenny while supplies were also being interrupted in parts of Granard, Co Longford, and Kinnegad, Co Westmeath, he said on Thursday morning.“The conservation message is having an impact, we can see that in demand,” he said, appealing to the population to conserve where possible so as supply isn’t shut off for friends, family and neighbours. In particular, he urged people not to be using hoses or power washers, watering gardens, washing cars or filling paddling pools. Mr Gallen said people should have shorter showers rather than a bath and not run the tap when brushing teeth.Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said State and private advisory services are working with farmers threatened with fodder shortages because of drought conditions in some parts of the country. “The solution to this is rain, and unfortunately I’m not in a position to deliver that,” he said. “It is difficult, that is undoubtedly the case.”Race meetings at eight greyhound stadium on Friday have been delayed by one hour to allow for cooler temperatures to ensure the welfare of greyhounds. Affected stadia include Clonmel, Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Newbridge, Tralee and Waterford. Racing for Friday has been cancelled at Youghal and Longford which will postpone the €10,000 Longford Greyhound Derby Final.Racing at Shelbourne Park and Dundalk Stadium on Friday will proceed as planned. The Irish Greyhound Board (IGB) has suspended all racing and trials between 10am and 7.30pm each day with immediate effect. Iarnród Éireann has advised customers to stay hydrated when travelling during the hot weather spell, and are distributing 50,000 bottles of water to customers free of charge at major stations over the coming days around the network.Iarnród Éireann has also put into operation a series of hot weather protocols to ensure services run without disruption. Fleet maintenance will focus on cooling systems on board, and on ensuring air-conditioning is operating well on equipped fleets, with fleets being monitored remotely and in maintenance centres.Some track maintenance works are being deferred, as unsettling the track bed can increase the risk of rail buckling in the heat. However, engineers say that rail heat levels have not approached levels to cause concern or to require speed restrictions yet. It has become so hot that members of the the normally stuffy Barristers Tea Room Restaurant in the Four Courts can remove their jackets. The notice was pinned to the door of the restaurant with the caveat in small print that the recommendation came from the Health Service Executive (HSE). There was good news for bathers in the north Dublin area. Fingal County Council has lifted the temporary ‘do not swim’ notice for Rush south beach which was issued last Friday due to the risk of deterioration in water quality following an emergency sewage overflow at Rush east shore. Samples of the water were taken on Monday and the results were excellent.Conor Faughnan, of the Automobile Association, said its breakdown service has been very busy because of hot weather problems. These include vehicles overheating and “lots and lots of tyre problems”. “In very hot weather if your tyre is weak, if it is under-inflated, has any blisters on it, if the tread is worn out, weather like this will find it out,” he told RTÉ Radio One. “The hot weather causes the tyre to expand and that exacerbates wear and tear. We’ve had a lot of call outs for tyres over the past few days.”Mr Faughnan said while major routes were bearing up against the heat, some 90,000 kilometres of secondary roads around the country are “still basically chip and tar.”In very hot weather they need treatment, and motorists should not assume driving conditions are necessarily good because it is sunny weather as “roads can get a little slippery.”Drivers are also being warned not to throw cigarettes out windows, as the fire hazard in dry weather is more severe.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3547179.1530201630!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk urged to soften some of its red lines on brexit at eu summit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar: “We’re two years telling people that it can’t be cherrypicking – it can’t be cake and eat it.” Photograph: Eric VidalReuters The EU is willing to be more flexible in the Brexit negotiations, the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said, but the UK needs to “soften some of its red lines” if there is to be any progress in the talks.Mr Varadkar was speaking as he entered talks with EU leaders at the beginning of a two-day summit in Brussels on Thursday. But Mr Varadkar also warned that the EU could not compromise on the fundamental principles of the single market to make special arrangements for the British.“We as Europe, the 27 member states, are willing to be more flexible,” Mr Varadkar said.“But in order to be more flexible, the United Kingdom needs to soften some of its red lines. There are things that we just can’t compromise on.“The four freedoms of the single market have to go together. You can’t have one freedom or two freedoms or three and a half freedoms. If we were ever to agree to that the European Union would start to break up and that is something that we can’t ever contemplate,” the Taoiseach said.Mr Varadkar reiterated the EU’s opposition to the UK’s plan to take parts of the single market but not others, and also warned that any relationship between the EU and the UK in the future “isn’t going to be one of absolute equals”.“We’re two years telling people that it can’t be cherrypicking – it can’t be cake and eat it,” Mr Varadkar said.“Any relationship that exists in the future between the EU and the UK isn’t going to be one of absolute equals. We’re 27 members states, the UK is one country. We’re 500 million people, the UK is 60 million. That basic fact needs to be realised and understood,” he said.Mr Varadkar and the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had previously said that they had to see significant progress on the Irish Border issue by the time of the summit or the talks on a withdrawal agreement – due to conclude by October – would run into difficulty. EU leaders have repeatedly stressed that without a withdrawal agreement, there will be no transition period for the UK, and the British will leave the bloc in March of next year. If that happens, it would throw trade between the UK and the EU into chaos.“The deadline for the withdrawal agreement has always been October and that has been the case since day one,” Mr Varadkar said.“However, we did expect that we would make more progress, or any progress really, we expected there would be progress at this summit in June, like there was in March, like there was in December.“There hasn’t been. So what I will be saying to prime minister May is that we all need to intensify our efforts now. All of us want there to be a deal. We need deal.

They figured it would take them two years, but within months they realised that something was terribly wrong.The scientists, Dr Úna Fitzpatrick and Dr Tomás Murray, were new to the subject, and the idea of taking on an all-Ireland bee census was pioneering. They searched the historical data on Irish bees and two names cropped up: Arthur Stelfox and Prof John Breen, now retired from the University of Limerick.Stelfox worked in the National Museum of Ireland in the 1920s, and he was the first person to scientifically record bees in Ireland. When Stelfox died in the early 1970s, a Cork man called John Breen was studying wood ants in Tipperary. Breen was mad about bees. He would travel the hedgerow-dense roads on a Yamaha 50 motorbike if he spotted a bee, he’d pull over. “I was collecting bees everywhere, putting them in boxes and recording where I found them,” he says. “I’d stop at the side of the road and find nine species on one patch.” Today, he adds, he’d be lucky to find two or three.Breen built a valuable record. In 2004, Murray and Fitzpatrick went through his boxes and extracted the data. Armed with Stelfox’s and Breen’s records, they got to work. Fitzpatrick would survey the south and east of Ireland Murray would take the rest. What emerged was a sorry tale of decline and loss.Fitzpatrick went to the Clare coast to search for the Great Yellow Bumblebee, a remarkable species which Breen had regularly spotted. “I was shocked,” she says. “We expected to find it, but the habitat had gone because of urbanisation and the development of golf courses.” Fitzpatrick mentions six other species that Stelfox and Breen had commonly seen. “We barely saw them at all,” she notes.Murray was having similar problems in Roscommon. Bee numbers were low. It was as if he had stumbled into a rural village after a wave of emigration, only to find a handful of people left. He looked for the little Shrill Carder Bee, which makes a loud, soprano buzz –“you hear it before you see it”. Stelfox had recorded it in many areas. Murray found it once.In 2006, Fitzpatrick and Murray published their findings. Half of all species were in decline.Today they sum it up in a sentence: a third of all bee species in Ireland will be extinct by 2030.Some bees are declining so rapidly that Prof Jane Stout of Trinity College fears we are facing a “silent spring” of loss. It’s a staggering prospect as we are only beginning to grasp the consequences. They are our great unpaid pollinators. If they go missing, then what?We have just one honeybee species in Ireland, and it’s doing okay. Scientists say it’s more like livestock than wildlife farmed in hives, it will be fine as long as beekeepers are around. It’s the decline of our other bees – we have 21 species of bumblebees and 75 species of “solitary” bees – that’s so dramatic.These bees inhabit an astonishing world of complex behaviours. Consider the bumblebees. They beat their wings 8,000 times a minute. They can fly when loaded down with pollen and nectar that doubles their body weight. One species has gravity-defying swoops of orange hair on the top of its face, a bit like Donald Trump. Another has a long, horse-like face. The Aran Islands has its own bespoke bumblebee found nowhere else in the world.These sociable and hairy bees live a short life. They hibernate over winter in the soil scientists think they prefer cool north-facing banks, but they aren’t sure. The bumblebee queen emerges in spring to build a nest in the ground. She produces sterile female workers who live for the common good and keep the colony fed. Her second load of offspring, male drones, have one purpose: to mate with virgin queens. Then they die.So-called solitary bees pack a wallop when it comes to pollination one bee does the work of hundreds of honeybees. Many of these species are in decline and some, like the Dark Nomad Bee, are extinct. It was last seen on a summer’s day in Dublin in 1902.New species of solitary bees have appeared. The dark blue Violet Carpenter bee arrived in Waterford in 2007 but the reason it’s here is because temperatures are increasing a vivid example, scientists say, of climate change in action.The same is true of the Wool Carder bee, first seen in 2015. It’s unique among solitary bees for having a rampant sex life males are at it every 35 seconds. He ferociously patrols his flower-rich territory, armed with spikes on his body to tear intruders apart. He will make an exception when a female Wool Carder flits in, but there can be a whiff of #metoo in his approach – he will grab her and have his way, whether she wants it or not.Theories abound to explain the decline of our bees: urbanisation the intensification of agriculture the toxic impact of pesticides our “tidiness” culture which has caused the disappearance of flowers and weeds. Bees are hungry and homeless, starved of protein-rich pollen and sugary nectar. The flowers just aren’t there the bees are exhausted from trying to find them.The rapid changes in farming – from extensive to intensive, mixed to monoculture – have sounded the death knell for many species. Ireland’s grass-based farming system is a problem. Seven million cows graze on thick swards of shiny ryegrass, but according to Breen it’s useless for bees. “Intensification of our farming is the key issue,” he says. “It has taken a toll.”There are glimmers of hope. The “Ginger Spice” of the bee world is the Tawny Mining Bee which has a mass of bright red hair. It was presumed extinct until a few years ago when it was spotted in Kilkenny. It nests in gardens and feeds on flowering hedgerows, and scientists hope that this ginger bombshell will be found elsewhere. Could it be that if we all look we will find other long-lost species along the way?We know that bees are moving westwards to the flower-rich grasslands and bogs. They do well in the Burren, where farmers are paid to produce bioersity as well as food. But land in the west is under pressure from a publicly-funded scheme which has kick-started a forestry boom in places like Leitrim. Farmland which would be great for bees is being planted up with sitka spruce, a tree which is terrible for bees, says Fitzpatrick.Ireland has long had a network of native hedgerows they are the thick green veins of our country-side. Bees love them. Tipperary dairy farmer John Fogarty, who is a near-expert on wild bees, is alarmed by the pace at which they’re being cut down. “If I look out my window I can see a man working on the land 10 miles away. Years ago, when the hedgerows were high, you just wouldn’t see that.”It’s a death by a thousand cuts. Take pesticides. When bees drink low levels of pesticides in nectar they behave like a drunken uncle at a late-night party. They go missing, and take ages to do simple tasks like eating. Pesticides leave them out of their minds.Dr Dara Stanley is an international bee expert who runs her eponymous lab in NUI Galway. She attached radio tags to the backs of bumblebees and fed half of them low levels of pesticides. She found that bees exposed to pesticides were going on longer foraging trips than those not exposed, and were bringing back pollen less often. “Whatever they were doing, they were not foraging,” she adds.There is evidence organic agriculture can have benefits for bees, while “we need to find ways to use chemicals more sustainably and more carefully”.What can be done? In 2015 officials in the Department of Agriculture told farmers they would pay them if they left a tonne of sand in the corner of a field, and also put up bee boxes around the farm – actions they said would help solitary bees. The department has spent over €1.6 million of public money on these actions. Will it make any difference? Scientists doubt it – some are privately scathing about the measures.In 2015, the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan was set up by Dr Fitzpatrick and Prof Stout. They have come up with 81 evidence-based actions they say will benefit bees. For example, Waterford City and County Council sowed a meadow in the city and the Larger Carder Bee, which had not been seen in years, appeared. The scientists said they’re “overwhelmed” by the positive response from the public. But their €15,000 grant from the Department of Agriculture has long been spent.It’s a common theme. Fitzpatrick and Murray now work in the National Bioersity Data Centre in Waterford. It’s in desperate need of secure, long-term funding. There’s an urgency to this – the latest data shows bumblebee numbers have fallen 14 per cent since 2012.Bees are clinging on but they face a barrage of man-made hazards. They have no protection under Irish or EU law. They are not on anyone’s political agenda. But the evidence is clear: we need to step back from the chemicals and respect our hedgerows re-wild our spaces and stop killing every weed we see.Bring back the flowers, say scientists, and the bees will return.

Photograph: Clemens BilanEPAGerman chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that the fate of the EU could rest on find a joint solution to the emotive refugee question.Her own political future rests on the outcome of the two-day summit of EU leaders in Brussels, which concludes today, after her Bavarian allies threatened to close German borders in the absence of concrete, burden-sharing deals on migration with EU partners.With the clock ticking and pressure growing, a fiery Angela Merkel warned the Bundestag – and the wider European audience – that the EU had never faced anything like the refugee crisis.In her Bundestag address she stuck to her long-held argument that such a vast challenge requires European, not national, solutions. Challenging the July 1st deadline set by her Bavarian Christian Social Union CSU) for her to come up with an acceptable EU-wide agreement on issue of migrants and refugees, she said such a sustainable agreement “will take time”.Broader agreement was still being held up, she said, by disagreement on common EU asylum standards and refugee quotas. Instead the chancellor flagged a “coalition of the willing” to share the refugee burden with frontline countries like Greece and Italy and to stop mobile migrants “seeking out” where they file for asylum.The German leader was full of praise for her interior minister Horst Seehofer, the CSU leader who has pushed her into her tightest political bind yet.She praised him for presenting a migration “master plan” to tackle bureaucratic failings at migration authorities and after a series of shocking crimes involving migrants. But Mr Seehofer wasn’t in the Bundestag chamber to hear the praise. After three years of unproductive wrangling in Brussels, the CSU man says he is is “proud” to have “kissed awake” the refugee question in the EU.On Wednesday evening he used a television interview to insist he would remain tough on migration, while sending conciliatory signals to Dr Merkel. “No one has an interest in toppling the chancellor,” he said. “But I cannot tell you how things will proceed after Sunday.”A weekend of high tension awaits Dr Merkel on her return from Brussels. At 3pm on Sunday the CSU executive board meets to decide whether the results of the Brussels summit go far enough to meet their demands.If not, Mr Seehofer has promised to instruct federal police to start turning back migrants already refused asylum in Germany, or previously registered elsewhere. Sunday is gearing up to be a long day of shuttle diplomacy – and megaphone diplomacy in media interviews. At 4pm Dr Merkel records a political interview, for broadcast three hours later, presenting her take on the Brussels summit outcome. Officials at her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) expect a decision on the future of the CDUCSU alliance – and the fourth Merkel administration – on Sunday evening."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3547270.1530205803!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"an ulster football guide to brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP leader Arlene Foster and Minister of State Joe McHugh  at the Ulster football final between Fermanagh and Donegal on Sunday.  Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireFootball supporters will travel a long way to witness a team’s success or failure, including across international borders. Making the journey is part of the point, since supporting a team is about belonging and dedication. England fans travelled more than 3,000km to Nizhny Novgorod to see their team beat Panama on Sunday.Fans from a different part of the UK also travelled across a border to watch an important match, which was held at the same time as England’s. These were fans of the Fermanagh Gaelic football team – traditionally a minnow thanks to the county’s small population – competing against Donegal in the Ulster final. The match was in Clones, Co Monaghan.To get there, some Fermanagh supporters will have driven only a few kilometres. Some may even have walked. The stadium is a 10-minute stroll across the Border, along a country lane. It is often said the only way to tell the exact location of the Border is the subtle change in the road markings. Not on this road: there are no markings.This is why the Border is a stumbling block in the Brexit talks. When the Irish government makes UK negotiators’ lives more difficult it is not just for cross-Border businesses seeking seamless trade, but also for Fermanagh’s Gaelic football fans.The Gaelic Athletic Association is the largest participatory sporting body on the island of Ireland, but its history is also intimately – if unofficially – linked to Irish nationalism. For decades its members were banned from playing “foreign” games such as rugby or soccer.Its members in Northern Ireland do not all vote Sinn Féin – though many do – but the vast majority will have some degree of sympathy with Irish nationalism. It was, after all, an organisation founded to preserve and enhance a cultural version of Irishness distinct from Britishness. It has never been a politically neutral organisation. Most controversial was its ban on “British” security force members, including the police in Northern Ireland, until the turn of the 21st century. This contributed to a long-term suspicion of the organisation among Ulster’s unionists.But as important as its nationalist connotations are its communal and local ones. Its clubs are, by tradition, connected to Catholic parishes. The league is far stronger in conservative rural areas than urban or suburban ones, where the bonds of locality and tradition are weaker. My grandfather, a small farmer in Co Down, limited his annual holidays to two excursions in September: to Dublin, to watch the All-Ireland hurling and football finals.For many of Northern Ireland’s rural nationalists, it allowed them to imagine themselves and their localities inside a nation. Even if they were not political, that nation was not the partitioned Northern Ireland, let alone the United Kingdom. Last Sunday, there were two pleasant surprises (although sadly Fermanagh lost). One was weather more like the Mediterranean than Monaghan the other was the appearance of the DUP leader Arlene Foster. Though she represents Fermanagh in the suspended Stormont Assembly, the devolved parliament in Belfast currently not sitting, she had never before been to a GAA match. The gesture was warmly welcomed many people in Northern Ireland are desperate for a break from tribal mud-slinging. She was clapped walking in, and rightly praised for standing for the Irish national anthem.She grew up just a few miles from Clones, on the northern side of the border, but her journey to the game was different than that of the other Fermanagh fans in one fundamental way. And different from the journeys my late grandfather made to Dublin. She was leaving the United Kingdom. To them, they were travelling within Ireland.The test of the Brexit deal on the Border will be how it manages this psychological dissonance: people who believe they belong to two nations existing in the same place. The next question is whether such a deal can also satisfy those England fans in Nizhny Novgorod who voted Leave. It probably cannot. – Copyright Financial Times Limited 2018* Matthew O’Toole is a former spokesman on Brexit in Number 10 Downing Street.

counter-attack, and looked a little embarrassed to have nothing to offer Mr Michel in return, such as an England shirt perhaps.Having been presented with an open goal, Mr Michel soon made it 2-0 to

this yearBP has bought UK electric vehicle charging company, Chargemaster, for £130m as part of its plans to serve EVs at forecourts across the country. Chargemaster, which was founded in 2008, operates the UK’s largest network of EV charging points, with 6,500 in total. It also designs, builds, sells and maintains the units. The deal signals BP’s intent to add electric vehicle drivers to its customer base in the UK.According to the oil firm, developing convenient and innovative EV charging technologies and networks “is a key part of BP’s strategy to advance the energy transition”. The company expects to launch the chargers at BP forecourts over the next year. It also plans to roll out ultra-fast charging equipment, which will include 150kW rapid chargers, which will take just 10 minutes to give cars enough energy to drive 100 miles. Tufan Erginbilgic, chief executive of BP Downstream, said the oil giant’s decision to combine with Chargemaster will “deliver a truly differentiated offer for the country’s growing number of electric vehicle owners”.Mr Erginbilgic said: “At BP we believe that fast and convenient charging is critical to support the successful adoption of electric vehicles. Combining BP’s and Chargemaster’s complementary expertise, experience and assets is an important step towards offering fast and ultra-fast charging at BP sites across the UK and to BP becoming the leading provider of energy to low carbon vehicles, on the road or at home.”Proposed ban on non-electric cars \u0027not ambitious enough\u0027How electric car batteries sparked a cobalt frenzy in 2017Global electric car sales jump to record high in third-quarterDavid Martell, chief executive of Chargemaster, said the deal “marks a true milestone in the move towards low carbon motoring in the UK”. After the deal completes, all Chargemaster employees will continue to be employed by BP Chargemaster or its subsidiaries. BP Chargemaster will operate as a wholly-owned BP entity.Erik Fairbairn, chief exec and founder of Pod Point, a competitor of Chargemaster, said the tie-up was “testament to the fact that future of transport is electric”. “Traditional oil companies know that they cannot afford to ignore this shift from internal combustion engine vehicles,” he added.“We\u0027ve always highlighted how EV technology is advancing so rapidly that within just a few years they will become the natural choice for anyone buying a car. Today\u0027s news shows that this is becoming an increasingly mainstream view.

The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

Tufan Erginbilgic, chief executive of BP Downstream, said the oil giant’s decision to combine with Chargemaster will “deliver a truly differentiated offer for the country’s growing number of electric vehicle owners”.Mr Erginbilgic said: “At BP we believe that fast and convenient charging is critical to support the successful adoption of electric vehicles. Combining BP’s and Chargemaster’s complementary expertise, experience and assets is an important step towards offering fast and ultra-fast charging at BP sites across the UK and to BP becoming the leading provider of energy to low carbon vehicles, on the road or at home.”Proposed ban on non-electric cars \u0027not ambitious enough\u0027How electric car batteries sparked a cobalt frenzy in 2017Global electric car sales jump to record high in third-quarterDavid Martell, chief executive of Chargemaster, said the deal “marks a true milestone in the move towards low carbon motoring in the UK”. After the deal completes, all Chargemaster employees will continue to be employed by BP Chargemaster or its subsidiaries. BP Chargemaster will operate as a wholly-owned BP entity.Erik Fairbairn, chief exec and founder of Pod Point, a competitor of Chargemaster, said the tie-up was “testament to the fact that future of transport is electric”. “Traditional oil companies know that they cannot afford to ignore this shift from internal combustion engine vehicles,” he added.“We\u0027ve always highlighted how EV technology is advancing so rapidly that within just a few years they will become the natural choice for anyone buying a car. Today\u0027s news shows that this is becoming an increasingly mainstream view. It’s obviously exciting to see the rapid acceleration of the EV market.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Usually after brushing his teeth. Or when stopping by the bathroom, or anywhere with a mirror.He hooks an index finger into each side of his mouth and pulls gently upward. He puckers his face into a kiss, then opens wide into an O, trying to limber up his facial muscles. He practises both the Mona Lisa – slight, closed-lip – and a wide, toothy smile.At least, he’s supposed to do his exercises every day. Being 13, he sometimes forgets, though he understands their importance.“I need to stretch my cheeks,” he says. “I do it for a couple minutes. I have to do it every single day.” He exercises so much that his jaw sometimes hurts. \u0026nbspDavid and Victoria Beckham smile in \u0027amazing\u0027 family night picture How to get white teeth: Four top tips to achieve a brighter smileMan smiles before lethal injection for murder of two young daughtersKevin was born in New Jersey with a rare malignant vascular tumour, a kaposiform haemangioendothelioma, covering the left side of his face, squeezing shut his left eye and pushing his nose to the right. Immediately after his birth, doctors whisked him away to another hospital in another state – the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. His mother didn’t see him again until he was eight days old.The doctor told Kevin’s parents that the chance of him surviving was slim.\u0026nbspBut survive he did. However, the large tumour and the damage from its treatment prevented him from being able to do one of the most fundamental things humans do.\u0026nbspSmile.Most babies are born immediately able to communicate with the world around them in one way: by crying.The second signal babies send out is a smile. Newborns can smile spontaneously, as a reflex. This is sometimes misinterpreted by new parents as a reaction to their presence, a reward for their intense concern and sleepless efforts. However, it’s not until six to eight weeks of age that babies smile in a social way. Blind babies do this at the same time.That new parents sometimes optimistically interpret the first reflex smiles as meaning something more underscores the duality of smiling: there is the physical act, and then the interpretation society gives to it.\u0026nbspThe smile, and what the smile means.On a physical level, a smile is clear enough. There are 17 pairs of muscles controlling expression in the human face, plus a singular muscle, the orbicularis oris, a ring that goes entirely around the mouth.When the brain either reacts to a stimulus spontaneously or decides to form an expression intentionally, a message is sent out over the sixth and seventh cranial nerves. These branch across each side of the face from the eyebrows to the chin, connecting to a combination of muscles controlling the lips, nose, eyes and forehead.The basic upward curving smile is achieved primarily by two pairs of zygomaticus muscles, major and minor. These connect the corners of the mouth to the temples, tugging lips upward – often accompanied, depending on the underlying emotions and thoughts, by the levator labii superioris, raising the upper lip, and other muscles of the face.And as for the oft-cited folk wisdom about how it takes more muscles to frown than smile – the jury’s still out, especially as different smiles require different numbers of muscles. However, one source suggests that a genuine smile takes about as many muscles as a frown (and that a particularly insincere kind of smile might take not much more than the pair of risorius muscles).It is when we leave the realm of physiognomy, however, that the smile becomes enigmatic. This contraction of various facial muscles resonates across the entire arc of human history, from the grinning Greek kouros sculptures of 2,500 years ago right up to emoji, those little images that pepper our online communications.One study of smartphone users from 60 countries showed that emoji with smiling faces are by far the most prevalent in messages. The most popular overall – the face with tears of joy – was picked as the 2015 Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries. \u0026nbspJust as this emoji expresses more than mere happiness – tears adding the ironic twist so popular online – smiles themselves can convey so much more than happiness. Interpreting their nuances is a challenge whether dealing with art history or interpersonal encounters or the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.A 2016 study, published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour, questioned thousands of people in 44 cultures about sets of photographs of eight faces – four smiling, four not.In most of these cultures, people deemed the smiling faces to be more honest than the non-smiling ones. This difference was huge in some countries, such as Switzerland, Australia and the Philippines, but small in others, such as Pakistan, Russia and France. And in a few countries, such as Iran, India and Zimbabwe, there was no trustworthiness benefit to smiling at all.Why? That question is also complicated, but in essence, the researchers concluded it has to do with whether a society is set up so that its members assume that other people are dealing with them honestly. “Greater corruption levels decreased trust granted towards smiling iniduals,” the authors concluded.That attitude harks back to a very old view of smiling as being opposed to pious solemnity. There is exactly one smile in the Old Testament – Job, ironically – though in many passages faces are said to “shine”, which could mean smiling or could mean heavenly radiance.Eastern religions often use the smile to denote enlightenment. The literal name of the 1000-year-old Flower Sermon, which describes the origin of Zen Buddhism, is: “Pick up flower, subtle smile.”\u0026nbspThe Buddha and various religious figures were depicted with serene smiles, though the original Buddhist texts are as devoid of smiling as Western scripture. Jesus weeps but never smiles.Nor did Kevin Portillo, not fully. He did not smile on schedule. At five weeks old, he was already a week into chemotherapy with vincristine, an anticancer drug so powerful it can cause bone pain and skin rashes. Doctors warned his mother that the treatment might leave him blind, or deaf, or unable to walk.“If he survived,” says his mother, Silvia Portillo, in Spanish, speaking through a translator. “The doctor always said he could not give us hope that he would survive.”Whether stunted due to the tumour or killed by the chemo, Kevin’s seventh cranial nerve withered. That nerve originates at the brainstem then branches out across the face. It is susceptible not only to tumours, as in Kevin’s case, but also to rare conditions such as Moebius syndrome, a congenital facial paralysis caused by missing or stunted cranial nerves. You can’t smile, frown, or move your eyes from side to side.“You essentially have a mask on your face,” says Roland Bienvenu, 67, a Texan with Moebius syndrome.Without being able to smile, others “can get the incorrect impression of you,” says Bienvenu. “You can almost read their thoughts. They wonder, ‘Is something wrong with him? Has he had an accident?’ They question your intellectual ability, think maybe he’s got some intellectual disability since he’s got this blank look on his face.”A lopsided smile can be as problematic as no smile at all.“I have half a smile, so even with that I am able to successfully convey emotion,” writes Dawn Shawn, born with a teratoma – a fast-growing tumour that was interfering with her windpipe.“The hardest part for me was seeing photos of myself smiling, because smiling exaggerates the fact that half my face doesn’t move very much. But eventually I learned to own it. That is me. That is how I look.”The challenges stemming from lack of a smile are frequently compounded. When people have a medical condition severe enough to keep them from smiling, other difficulties tend to be involved.“He was different than the other kids,” says Silvia of her son. “He was fed for four years through the G-tube in his stomach. He wasn’t able to have a normal life, because every few hours he had to be connected to the machine to be fed.” Little kids, being curious, would look and ask what happened to him, she says.While those who cannot smile can blame the state of their facial nerves and muscles, those who can smile are often concerned with a different aspect of physiognomy: their teeth. More than $3bn is spent worldwide on teeth-whitening products, with billions more spent on braces and on purely cosmetic dentistry: straightening crooked teeth, for instance, or reducing the amount of gum that shows when a person smiles.Caring for the state of your teeth is not a modern concern. The Romans had dentists and used chewing sticks and toothpaste. They preferred dazzling white smiles, sometimes rinsing their teeth in urine to enhance the effect.Contrary to common modern perceptions, the ancients had surprisingly good teeth, for reasons that have nothing to do with dentistry. A CAT scan of 30 adult bodies recovered at Pompeii found they had “perfect teeth”.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.650 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.750 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.850 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.1350 Fertility \u0027breakthrough\u0027 as human eggs grown in lab for first timeHuman eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments. 1450 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.1550 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1650 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded1750 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively1850 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned.

Prior to the French Revolution, broad smiles in art were overwhelmingly the realm of the lewd, the drunk and the boisterous lower classes.“The whole face ought to reflect an air of seriousness and wisdom,” John Baptist de La Salle wrote in his 1703 The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility, allowing that people might, under certain circumstances, convey the impression that they are happy, provided it is done within limits.“There are some people who raise their upper lip so high or let the lower lip sag so much that their teeth are almost entirely visible. This is entirely contrary to decorum, which forbids you to allow your teeth to be uncovered, for nature gave us lips to conceal them…”In The Smile Revolution in Eighteenth Century Paris, Colin Jones argues that smiling reflected the gathering sense of inidual worth that went along with the beheading of kings:This shift in social practices and in sensibilities involved the emergence of the perception, common in our own day, that the smile offered a key to inidual identity. In late eighteenth-century Paris, the smile came to be viewed as symbol of an inidual’s innermost and most authentic self. In a way that was perceived as both novel and modern, it was held to reveal the character of the person within.Photography, by capturing smiles, eventually helped popularise them. But the sitters in 19th-century photographs still rarely smiled, a neutral continence being both easier to hold over the long exposure necessary at the time and less likely to detract from the gravity of the occasion.“A photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever,” humorist Mark Twain was quoted as remarking in the 1913 memoir of an acquaintance.Around the same time, however, Kodak in the US launched extensive advertising campaigns to help consumers see photography as a means of recording joyous events and celebrations.Over the century, smiles showed a confidence in keeping with the rise of modern capitalism. “An insincere grin? That doesn’t fool anybody,” Dale Carnegie wrote in his 1936 bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People, embraced as a life guide by millions.“We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.”Part of the attractiveness of smiles is they are so easily extended. Part of their menace is that they can also be just as easily withheld.“For a salesman, there’s no rock bottom to the life,” Charlie says at the end of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. “He don’t put a bolt to a nut, he don’t tell you the law or give you medicine. He’s a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back – that’s an earthquake.”Once Kevin was able to eat food, go to school and enjoy usual childhood pastimes – he became passionate about soccer and playing the drums – he still felt the tremors of having a half-smile in a world solidly established upon “a cultural expectation of pearly perfection”, as Richard Barnett writes in his book The Smile Stealers.“I couldn’t smile on my left, I only smiled on my right,” says Kevin. “My smile was weird … people kept asking what happened to me, why I\u0027m like this. I keep telling them I was like this when I was born.”If you see someone in a wheelchair, you anticipate that the person might have trouble walking and assume a physical condition is involved. But facial paralysis carries no telltale equipment, and is rare enough that the unaffected population is not generally familiar with the conditions that cause it, whether congenital or appearing later in life.One of the latter is Bell’s palsy, an inflammation of the sheathing around the facial nerves on one side that paralyses half the face, causing the eye and corner of the mouth to droop. It usually strikes men and women between the ages of 15 and 60.In most cases temporary, Bell’s palsy generally slowly goes away as mysteriously as it arrives. Doctors suspect it is caused by a viral infection. There are also traumatic events – car wrecks, sporting accidents – that damage nerves and muscles in the face, plus congenital irregularities such as cleft palate.A common condition that can also affect the smile is stroke. A sagging smile or face drooped on one side is one of three signs that a person has had a stroke and needs immediate emergency care (the other two are weakness or numbness in one arm, and slurred or garbled speech).While losing a smile is a serious blow at any age, it can have a particular impact on younger people, who are starting out, forming the bonds that will carry them through the rest of their lives.\u0026nbspOr trying to.“It’s a huge problem,” says Tami Konieczny, supervisor of occupational therapy at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHoP). “When you look at somebody, the first thing you see is their face, their ability to smile or not smile, or an asymmetrical smile. It’s your social world.“If someone can’t read your facial expressions, then it’s difficult to be socially accepted. It’s hugely devastating for kids. I had kids photoshopping their pictures. They are taking mirror images of their good side and copying it, photoshopping their own pictures before posting them to social media.”Photoshopping might work on Facebook. But fixing a smile bisected by nerve damage and subsequent muscle loss – Kevin couldn’t move the muscles on the left side of his face, so they atrophied – is far more complicated. Sometimes, it requires multi-stage plastic surgery spread out over a year or more.There are two major procedures available for facial reanimation, according to Phuong Nguyen, a plastic surgeon and reconstructive surgeon at CHoP.The newest, which has its roots in older techniques, is called a lengthening temporalis myoplasty – taking part of the broad band of muscle that powers the jaws and repurposing it to draw up the lips.That wasn’t ideal for Kevin because he had one side of his face working. The older, more complicated surgery was better suited to him.“Kevin had the most commonly done one, a classic two-stage cross-face nerve graft followed by a free gracilis muscle transfer,” says Nguyen. “To be perfectly honest, when Kevin had his stage, we weren’t familiar with the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure yet.”Nguyen later learned the new procedure from facial reanimation pioneer Ronald Zuker, a Canadian plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and from its originator, French surgeon Daniel Labbé.“My preference is to do it when kids are five years of age,” says Zuker. “At the time, if I can restore a smile for them, they can go to primary school, meet kids on the playground, meet kids in class. They have their smiles and are well-equipped to handle that situation.”Why put children through what is still elective surgery?“It’s incredibly important to be able to interact with humans on a face-to-face basis,” says Zuker. “If you don’t have the ability to smile, you are at a disadvantage. People cannot understand your inner emotions. They mistake your appearance for being disinterested, or not too bright, or not very involved in the conversation.”Still, some parents prefer to wait until their children are older and can participate in the decision.“If families want to wait, that’s perfectly fine,” says Zuker. “Sometimes when a kid is nine or 10 they look in the mirror and say, ‘You know, I really want this surgery.’ That’s the time to do it.”Which is what happened with Kevin. He was doing well, “even with that scar on his face, has always been popular at school,” says his mother. “He’s always been a happy kid.”But there were kids that made fun of him, she says. One day when he was about nine, he was sad. “I said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said, ‘Some kids, they’re not my friends. They laugh at me because I look funny.’ It was really hard for us as parents.”“We always wanted the surgery,” she says. “But we were told it was impossible. We had to wait to see how everything was changing.”At age 10, Kevin told his parents that he wanted to do what most people do without giving it a second thought. He knew it would be a long, painful, difficult procedure, but it was one he wanted to undergo.“He’s very engaging, very motivated,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his occupational therapist at CHoP. “His goal, I wrote in my notes, was to have a symmetrical smile.”As with smiles themselves, so the scientific study of smiles reflects the cleavage between the physical and the interpretive. The physical side is entwined with the long history of plastic surgery, which has tended to focus on survivors of diseases like syphilis and of the knives of vengeful authorities and warlords.The father of modern plastic surgery, Harold Gillies, reported in 1934 that restoring the ability to smile made patients’ faces “feel much more comfortable”. In addition, Gillies observed, “the psychological effect is also one of considerable value”.On the interpretive side, Charles Darwin discusses the meaning and value of smiles in his 1872 landmark The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Like many, Darwin sees a smile as the first part of a continuum.“A smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the development of a laugh,” \u0026nbsphe writes, then reverses course, musing that perhaps the smile is instead the remnant of laughter.He observes his own infants closely, detecting in two their first smiles at six weeks, and earlier in the third. He comments how smiles do more than merely convey happiness, mentioning the “derisive or sardonic smile” and the “unnatural or false smile”, and showing photos to see if his associates can read what they mean.The scientific study of smiles finds differences in gender (generally, women smile more) and culture. Smiles are definitely communicative – people smile more when in public than they do when alone, and more when interacting with others than when not.Scientists have shown that smiles are far easier to recognise than other expressions. What they don’t know is why.“We can do really well recognising smiles,” says Aleix Martinez, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University and founder of its Computational Biology and Cognitive Science Lab.“Why is that true? Nobody can answer that right now. We don’t know. We really do not know. We have a classical experiment, where we showed images of facial expressions to people, but we showed them very rapidly… 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds.“People can detect a smile even in exposures smaller than 10 milliseconds. I can show you an image for just 10 milliseconds and you can tell me it’s a smile. It does not work with any other expression.”Fear takes an exposure time of 250 milliseconds to recognise – 25 times as long as a smile, “which makes absolutely no sense, evolutionarily speaking,” Martinez says. “Recognising fear is fundamental to survival, while a smile… But that’s how we are wired.”Studies have shown that smiling faces are judged as more familiar than neutral ones. And it’s not just us that can recognise smiles more easily. “This is true both for humans and for machines,” says Martinez. Alibaba, China’s answer to Amazon, launched its new facial recognition payment system called “Smile to Pay” in September 2017.Although scientists have been studying smiles for about 150 years, they are still at the stage of trying to count and categorise types of smile among the millions of possible facial expressions.“One of the fundamental questions in the scientific literature right now is how many facial expressions do we actually produce?” says Martinez. “Nobody knows.”Scientists such as Martinez theorise that smiles – as well as frowns and other facial expressions – are remnants of humanity’s distant pre-linguistic heritage. Human language started developing as far back as 100,000 years ago, but our expressions reach back further still, even to before our origins as human beings.“Before we could communicate verbally, we had to communicate with our faces,” Martinez says. “Which brings us to a very interesting, very fundamental question in science: where does language come from? Language is not fossilised, not found in any other living species. How could something that complex have evolved from nothingness?”One of the hypotheses is that it evolved through facial expression of emotion, he says. “First we learned to move our facial muscles – ‘I’m happy. I feel positive with you! I’m angry. I feel disgust.’ Then language came through a grammaticalisation of facial expressions, which over time evolved into what we call grammar and language.”In October 2015, Nguyen, who plays in a band, cranked up some rock music in the operating room at CHoP – he thinks it was probably something from the Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream.He began work by removing a section of sural nerve from Kevin’s right ankle and attaching it to the working right side of his face, running it underneath his upper lip, to the paralysed left.“We bring it across, parking it, waiting for nerves to regrow from the right side to the left,” Nguyen says.That growth took almost a year. The nerve fibres advanced about a millimetre a day (about 24,000 times slower than a snail).In nerve grafts like this, many of the fibres don’t make it across. This means that the nerve can lose the ability to transmit information – in a few cases, completely.“The thing with nerve-based surgery, you don’t get a lot of instant gratification or feedback,” says Nguyen. “You do the procedure and don’t know if it works or not. You have to wait.”During that time, doctors would periodically tap areas of Kevin’s cheek, to see if the nerve was taking. “When it tingles, you know the nerve is growing,” says Nguyen.The body has a way of covering losses. Removing that nerve did cause a small patch of skin on Kevin’s ankle to go numb. But as he was still growing, the numb patch began to shrink as the neural network took over its function.Once Nguyen was certain the nerve was in place and functioning, it was time for the second stage of the surgery.The mystery of Mona Lisa\u0027s smile has finally been solved Mona Lisa smile \u0027based on his gay lover\u0027, art historian claimsRussian Mona Lisa could be genuineSecrets of the Mona Lisa, BBC2, TV review: the face behind the paintOne morning in August 2016, he took a purple marker and wrote a “P” on Kevin’s left temple and an “NP” on his right, for “paralysed” and “not paralysed”, a common surgical precaution against the risk of cutting into the wrong side of a patient – easier than you might imagine, considering how much of a patient’s body is draped before surgery.“It happens,” says Nguyen. “You want to make it idiot-proof.” \u0026nbspHe also drew a pair of parallel lines, marking the location of a prime artery, and an arrow: the vector Kevin’s smile would take.The surgeon made an incision from the temporal hair line, in front of Kevin’s left ear, then pivoting back under and behind it, extending into his neck – the standard location for hiding plastic surgery scars. The skin on a face peels back easily. He attached three sutures to the inside corner of Kevin’s mouth and gently pulled, to gauge exactly where the muscle should be attached.“So you know it’s in the right place,” explains Nguyen. “If you don’t get this right, they’re going to have to live with it for the rest of their life.”The moment Nguyen put strain on the triple surgical thread was the first time Kevin Portillo ever smiled on the left side of his face.That done, Nguyen removed a 12-centimetre segment of gracilis muscle, along with a section of artery and vein, from the inside of Kevin’s left thigh, as well as the obturator nerve. The muscle was secured in place by a customised splint that hooked into Kevin’s mouth and was sewn to the side of his head to keep the relocated muscle from pulling out before it healed.The section was taken from Kevin’s thigh because the powerful upper leg is rich in muscles. “There are so many muscles that do the same function… you don’t miss this,” Nguyen says.Well… most wouldn’t miss it. Kevin, a diehard young soccer fan, did. “When the surgery came I couldn’t play,” he says. “I didn’t know it would take that long. I thought it would take a couple days and I would be back.”Just how long was he sidelined?“It was more than two weeks,” he says, sorrowfully.“He wasn’t concerned with how serious the surgery was,” his mother says, laughing. “He was more concerned with not being able to play soccer.”Over the next year, Kevin began to get motion on the left side of his mouth.“It’s really kind of a magical thing,” says Nguyen. “We do this procedure, a number of hours and effort, using not a small amount of resources. We don’t know if it works or not.“I saw him post-operatively within the first couple of weeks, he looked like he had this big bulgy thing in his cheek. Nothing was moving. All of a sudden, he was smiling. It was a really incredible moment.”Well, it’s magical, but it’s also hard work. Low-tech and high-tech.\u0026nbspKevin begins his regular occupational therapy session by holding a two-cent white plastic fork in his mouth and showing that he can move it up and down.“Try to purse your lips together to make it stand up,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his therapist at CHoP. “We’ve got it pretty solid in the middle. Try to work it over to the weaker side. Nice try… and that’s harder.”Kevin puts on purple latex gloves and pulls at the inside of his cheek.“You’re going to do your stretch on the inside,” says Field. “A nice, slow hold. Good. Bring that thumb up… Do you feel like it’s getting looser than it was?”“Mmm-hmmm,” Kevin agrees, gloved fingers in mouth.She takes some photos. There is a lot of photography in facial therapy, to track progress.“Now give me the biggest open-mouthed smile you can,” says Field. “Good. Can you make the left side go up even more? Try to make your gums even.”Then, after more exercises, she asks if he is ready for the computer work.They move into the next room, to a $20,000 Lenovo biometric therapy system. Field sticks a surface EMG – an oblong black sensor that reads electrical activity in the muscle – to Kevin’s left cheek and he plays a video game, Load Ship, where he moves animated boxes from a conveyor on the screen by smiling and relaxing.“Give me a big smile,” Field says, calibrating the device. “And relax.”He plays for four minutes, the game burbling a skittery kind of jazzy electronic music.They play a few other games: one trying to get a man to a safe spot as two serrated blue spaces come together. Then a marble maze.“How are you feeling?” she asks.“Hurts,” he replies.Physical rehabilitation is the part of the surgical process that often gets overlooked, but it can make the difference between success and failure.“It’s huge, particularly with facial palsy,” says Nguyen. “You can do technically very sound surgery on two completely different patients and have two completely different outcomes based on how involved they are with their own therapy… It just doesn’t look as good.”How does Kevin feel about being able to fully smile after a lifetime of not being able to?“I’ve been getting better on how I react. I do it automatically,” says Kevin. “Sometimes when somebody says a joke. It actually feels great now. Before it felt weird to not smile. Smiling with both sides of my mouth at same time, I feel I’m one of the other people who smiles right.”His mother remembers the moment she noticed.“We were at the table, we were eating,” says Silvia. “And then we said, ‘Kevin, are you moving there?’ He started moving. Not the way he was doing today little movements.”“We were eating,” he says. “I think she said something funny, and I just smiled.”And how does smiling affect his life?“Before, I was actually shy,” he says. “Right now, I’m less shy, more active.”“I used to have trouble expressing my emotions. Now people know if I’m smiling or laughing. When I laughed, before, I laughed weird. And right now, they know, bit by bit, that I was trying to smile, I was expressing my laughter and my smile. When I play soccer, and score a goal, I’m happy. I’m smiling, to tell everybody I scored.”You’d be forgiven for thinking that classifying and counting the different types of smile would be straightforward. It’s anything but.In the mid 19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne wanted to distinguish real smiles from fake. Interested in the response of nerves and muscles to stimulation, he applied electricity to particular parts of faces to see the results.He ided smiles into two groups: those that involved the crinkling of the eyes – sincere smiles – and those that used only the muscles around the mouth – insincere smiles.Today, the full smile that uses the muscles around the mouth and eyes is known as a “Duchenne smile” – and the fake one is the “Pan Am smile”, after the kind of smile you might greet someone with if it’s part of your job to be friendly.In 1974, Leonard Rubin described three basic types of smile, based on his study of 100 people:The “Mona Lisa”, where the corners of the mouth go up and outwards and the upper teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the zygomaticus major. About two-thirds of people studied smile this wayThe “canine” smile, where the canine teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the levator labii superioris. 31 per cent of people smiled like thisThe “full dentured”, where the lips are pulled back strongly, showing both upper and lower rows of teeth. All muscles are equally dominant. Just 2 per cent of people were found to smile this wayCosmetic surgeons, who have to be meticulous in identifying the smiles that their patients are paying good money to try to achieve, call these three types commissure, cuspid and complex, respectively.Phuong Nguyen, a Philadelphia plastic and reconstructive surgeon, attempts to clarify the matter using celebrities. The Mona Lisa, he says, is the Angelina Jolie. The Tom Cruise smile is a canine smile, and a Julia Roberts is the full dentured smile. This is a subjective matter. Other doctors place Jolie in the second or third categories.Smiling is not a realm given over to easy description. Contemplate the ideal smile as recounted by one clinician in the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics:An optimal smile is characterised by an upper lip that reaches the gingival margins, with an upward or straight curvature between the philtrum and commissures an upper incisal line coincident with the border of the lower lip minimal or no lateral negative space a commissural line and occlusal frontal plane parallel to the pupillary line and harmoniously integrated dental and gingival components.The total number of different types of smile is frequently debated. A recent BBC article gave the total as 19.Arguably the most important researcher into smiles over the past 30 years has been Paul Ekman at the University of California. His 1978 Facial Action Coding System, written with Wallace V Friesen, seeks to create an atlas of nearly all possible human expressions. Ekman says, in his book Telling Lies, that their technique for measuring the face can distinguish over 50 different smiles.Confused? You’re not the only one. Perhaps the best approach is to just grin and bear it…This story was first published on Mosaic\u0026nbspby Wellcome. It is republished here under a Creative Commons licence.

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But the significant number of EU migrants leaving is a reminder that the UK must remain an attractive place to work,” a CBI spokesperson said.“It is also time to confirm that this offer to EU citizens is independent of wider negotiations and that it will not be taken off the table altogether in the event of ‘no deal’.”Leaders in the health and social care sector have also mounted concerns about its capacity to recruit and retain care staff from other EU countries after Brexit, warning that without the “major contribution” made by foreign workers, more elderly and disabled people will be driven into institutional care settings and away from independent living.Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, told The Independent: “Social care is a fundamental public service on which millions of older people and disabled adults depend to live their lives. It is above all a ‘people business’, but it is proving difficult to attract enough high quality staff who want to engage in this demanding, albeit rewarding, work.\u0026nbsp“Every day there are an estimated 90,000 vacancies in the social care workforce, and in some parts of the country especially a major contribution is made by care staff who have come here from abroad, both from within the EU and also far beyond it.“Philip Connolly, policy manager at Disability Rights UK, echoed her concerns, saying: “These sectors are largely made up of people from overseas, but more and more of these people have been deterred from coming following the Brexit referendum.”Ms Abbott said many EU citizens are\u0026nbspworried about their future status.“Ministers have talked as if they are a bargaining chip and the government’s latest effort falls well short of providing certainty,” she added.\u0026nbsp“The government’s policy of creating a hostile environment affects all migrants, including those perfectly entitled to be here. It is wrong, and it is damaging our society and our prosperity. It should be abandoned.”Chai Patel, policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), claimed the UK was becoming a “less welcoming” place for migrants, and warned that this would be a “very serious” problem for public services and Britain’s economic future.“Immigrants pay more into public services than they take out, so if you’ve got fewer migrants coming in then you’ve got an issue with filling public sector jobs – particularly in the NHS – which is obviously disastrous,” he said.UK news in picturesPrime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

reports, the committee said the government must learn from the lessons of the past 10 years and commit to tough new regulations and strict enforcement.CCC chairman Lord Deben said housing and car companies “should be ashamed of themselves”, and accused construction companies of “cheating” their customers by not providing effective insulation for homes.The report noted the absence of the Department for Transport’s long-awaited strategy to deal with car emissions, and Lord Deben said the government needed to “get on with it”.“People need to get a sense of urgency, not just because climate change won’t wait, but because the less urgent you are the more expensive it will be to do the things we are going to have to do anyway,” he said.The committee also called for an end to “chopping and changing” of policies that have caused confusion and led to the demise of successful green measures like onshore wind power.\u0026nbspUnless action is taken, the UK will not meet either the fourth or fifth carbon budgets the government has set in order to reduce overall emissions by 80 per cent by 2050.“This is a really strongly worded warning and a wake-up call to the government to say they need to take swift action to get back on course and meet their climate obligations,” said Green co-leader Caroline Lucas.Legal \u0026amp General right to tell big companies to act on climate change Scotland \u0027not doing enough\u0027 to fight climate change despite new targetWorst-case climate change scenario could be more extreme than thought“The government seems to be very good at setting targets and very bad at actually ever meeting any of them”The nation’s carbon emissions are down 43 per cent compared to the 1990 levels the climate change act is based on, and the economy has grown significantly over that period.However, nearly all of this progress has come from the country’s shift to wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy.While the committee welcomed the government’s clean growth strategy, which was supposed to bring together every sector to tackle climate change, there have been no policies announced to implement it.“Today’s report shows how the Tories are failing to meet our climate change commitments and how they have made little to no progress in the six months since the last report,” said Dr Alan Whitehead, Labour\u0027s shadow minister for energy and climate change.“Just this week they scrapped support for Swansea Bay tidal lagoon whilst supporting a third runway at Heathrow which shows how empty their green rhetoric is.”Paul Morozzo, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “This government can’t live up to its claims to climate leadership as long as it backs and new Heathrow runway and stalls action on cleaning up our road transport.”Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the industry recognised that more needs to be done, but they have “some of the most challenging carbon dioxide reduction targets of any sector and a record of delivering on them”.“We need a strategy with realistic ambition levels that supports industry’s efforts, allows manufacturers time to invest, innovate and sell competitively, and which provides the right incentives to take the consumer with us.”Though the CCC declined to judge how sensible a new runway at Heathrow would be, they noted there would not be room for any more aviation growth if there is any chance of meeting emission targets.“It is for the government to decide whether it wants to use up the elbow room it has got by having a new Heathrow runway,” said Lord Deben.He noted that if the plans go ahead the expansion will drain virtually all the “generous” amount of carbon emissions that are allowed in the emissions framework.It will also require other sectors to make even greater reductions in their emissions to make up for the uptick from planes.Emission cuts from aviation and other sectors will need to be even greater if the government commits to the stricter targets suggested by the Paris climate agreement, and the CCC said preparations must be made for this possibility.A government spokesperson said the UK has proven itself to be a “world leader” in tackling climate change since the introduction of the climate change act.“As the CCC has recognised, we’ve made huge progress in cleaning up the power and waste sectors and through our ambitious clean growth strategy we’re confident of cutting emissions across the wider economy to meet our carbon budgets while seizing the economic opportunities of clean growth,” they said.Committee on Climate ChangeEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Dutch prime minister\u0026nbspMark Rutte said\u0026nbspMs May had to make a decision with her cabinet and that “the first, second, and third priority now is to solve the issue of the Irish border”.But despite other leaders’ focus on the Irish issue, senior UK government officials familiar with the prime minister’s dinner speech suggested there was little content on the border.UK should have come up with Brexit plan two years ago, Irish PM saysTime is running out to avoid a Brexit no deal, Irish PM tells MayThe ugliest secret of Brexit concerns your salaryGovernment criticised for slow progress on post-Brexit flight dealMr Varadkar told reporters on the doorstep of the European Council building: “I think it would have been helpful if they had had that white paper two years ago.\u0026nbsp“You would have thought that before people voted to leave the European Union they would have an idea what the new relationship would look like but I appreciate that that hasn’t happened, and two years later it still hasn’t happened.”He added that he looked forward to seeing the plan when it was produced, but suggested that Britain did not understand that is was not an equal partner with the EU.\u0026nbsp“It needs to understand that we’re a union of 27 member states, 500 million people. We have laws and rules and principles and they can’t be changed for any one country, even a great country like Britain,” he said.You would have thought that before people voted to leave the European Union they would have an idea what the new relationship would look like but I appreciate that that\u0026nbsphasn’t happened, and two years later it still\u0026nbsphasn’t happened“Any relationship that exists in the future between the EU and the UK isn’t going to be one of absolute equals: we’re 27 member states, the UK is one country, we’re 500 million people, the UK is 60 million. That basic fact has to be realised.”The Irish prime minister\u0026nbspsaid he would not accept a land border with the UK, but said to be “responsible” Ireland and other countries would have to make preparations at ports and airports for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.Addressing the chaos in Theresa May’s cabinet, Mr Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, told reporters in Brussels: “I do understand it’s difficult to come to agreements within her cabinet and the UK parliament, but she has to.“I don’t want to talk in apocalyptic terms. What I want to say is that I believe that the first, second, and third priority now is to solve the issue of the Irish border. When that is solved then so many other issues will be easier to discuss.”Over dinner Ms May said the UK wanted to continue to contribute to the security of the continent, telling the leaders: “Our ability to do so is being put at risk. The existing legal frameworks for third countries will not allow us to realise the ambitious future security partnership that I believe is in all our interest.\u0026nbsp“Under our current position the UK would for example be able to share information through key databases and agencies, such as SIS2, ECRIS, and Prum that allow our law enforcement to protect all European citizens.\u0026nbsp“We would no longer be able to share real-time alerts for wanted persons including serious criminals. We would be able to respond less swiftly to alerts for missing people from either side of the Channel and reunite them with our loved ones. Our collective ability to map terrorist networks and bring those responsible to justice would be reduced.\u0026nbsp“That is not what I want and I do not want to\u0026nbspbelieve it is what you want either.

They must now set a deadline to make all blocks safe and take all steps necessary to see the work is done.”However, it is still unclear who will pay for the work after some building owners refused to meet the cost – instead telling residents to pay tens of thousands of pounds to make them safe.The government has resisted pressure to make owners pay – arguing leaseholders should “challenge the costs in courts if they are unreasonable” – although Theresa May hinted at a U-turn this week.Until now, it was thought that cladding that would fail fire safety tests introduced after the Grenfell disaster was on 141 private tower blocks.‘Like a war zone’: Harrowing testimony of first Grenfell firefighterGrenfell firefighter ‘did not consider evacuation’ ‘Grenfell two is in the post,’ says survivor who predicted deadly fireBeyonce and Jay Z pay tribute to Grenfell Tower fire victims in LondonIn his statement, Mr Brokenshire said local authorities had been “working hard to identify affected buildings in their areas” and had now tested more than 6,000 buildings.He also announced £1m for a new expert inspection team to speed up improvement works and “ensure building owners take the necessary action”.The minister said owners were responsible for the safety of their buildings and pledged the government would “hold them to account where they have unsafe cladding systems”.Town halls had begun\u0026nbsp“to compel them to take action” in some cases, MPs were told.Mr Brokenshire did not echo the prime minister’s threat that she was “not ruling anything out” if companies failed to pay to remove cladding.Speaking in the Commons, Ms May praised three companies – Barrett Homes, Legal and General and Taylor Wimpey – for “doing the right thing and taking responsibility”.And she said: “We want others to follow their lead… if they don’t, we are not ruling anything out at this stage.”Leaseholders have been forced to make insurance claims to cover the cost of removing and replacing the cladding, sometimes with the owners acting on their behalf.In many of the blocks, they have also been required to pay for round-the-clock patrols by fire wardens, because of the risk of a blaze.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The PM hopes to break a deadlock between her ministers, who have been unable to agree on a workable policy a year and a half after triggering Article 50.Mr Varadkar told reporters on the doorstep of the European Council building: “I think it would have been helpful if they had had that white paper two years ago.\u0026nbsp“You would have thought that before people voted to leave the European Union they would have an idea what the new relationship would look like but I appreciate that that hasn’t happened, and two years later it still hasn’t happened.”He added that he looked forward to seeing the plan when it was produced, but suggested that Britain did not understand that is was not an equal partner with the EU.\u0026nbspYou would have thought that before people voted to leave the European Union they would have an idea what the new relationship would look like“It needs to understand that we’re a union of 27 member states, 500 million people. We have laws and rules and principles and they can’t be changed for any one country, even a great country like Britain,” he said.“Any relationship that exists in the future between the EU and the UK isn’t going to be one of absolute equals: we’re 27 member states, the UK is one country, we’re 500 million people, the UK is 60 million. That basic fact has to be realised.”The Taoiseach said he would not accept a land border with the UK, but said to be “responsible” Ireland and other countries would have to make preparations at ports and airports for the possibility of a no deal Brexit.Addressing the chaos in Theresa May’s cabinet, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, told reporters in Brussels: “I do understand it’s difficult to come to agreements within her Cabinet and the UK parliament, but she has to. Everything I will do to support her to do that I will do.“I don’t want to talk in apocalyptic terms. What I want to say is that I believe that the first, second, and third priority now is to solve the issue of the Irish border. When that is solved then so many other issues will be easier to discuss.”Ms May is still locked in negotiations with her own Cabinet about the so-called “backstop” arrangement, and talks on the future relationship between the UK and EU have yet to progress past the very early stages. The EU says a deal needs to be done before October in order to give time for any agreement to be ratified.The UK has flat-out rejected EU plans to give a special status to Northern Ireland that would effectively keep it in the customs union and single market, and says any deal must apply to the whole UK and be time-limited. The EU says UK plans so far are not enough to actually prevent a hard border from happening.Theresa May said she would be “setting out our position for the future and what I want to be able to do” to leaders. She is missing England play Belgium in the World Cup\u0026nbspfor the dinner Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel presented her with a football shirt bearing the name of the Belgian player Hazard.\u0026nbsp“I look forward to talking with fellow leaders about the very good progress we’ve made on the withdrawal agreement and looking forward to securing our strong future partnership which I believe is in the interests of both the European Union and the United Kingdom,” she said.“I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done until now and certainly we would welcome this.”Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The 40-year-old is the first French head of state not to have done military service.Restoring military service for some 600,000 youths each year would ensure France kept its \u0026ldquostrategic autonomy and was able to \u0026ldquoact alone if needed in light of the multiplication of crises around the world, he told voters.During the campaign, Mr Macron said: \u0026ldquoI want every young French citizen to experience, even if only for a short time, military life.He said the move would \u0026ldquoallow our democracy to be more united and increase the resilience of our society.

Nothing, and so the whole idea is pointless\u0026hellip It\u0026rsquos obviously a fallback solution. Mr Macron would be better off scrapping the idea altogether.Mr Macron\u0026rsquos original proposal was to make French citizens have a \u0026ldquodirect experience of military life for a minimum of one month, between the ages of 18 to 21.The new military service will cover youths \u0026ldquoaround 16 years of age, both girls and boys, and will be ided into two separate phases. It will be overseen by the army and the national gendarmerie.The first stage will be a compulsory one-month placement focused on civic culture, which government officials say will \u0026ldquoenable young people to create new relationships and develop their role in society.The options being explored include voluntary teaching and charity work, as well as traditional military training with the police, fire service or army.The second stage is a voluntary placement of at least three months and up to a year, during which youths will be encouraged to work in \u0026ldquodefence and security. They would also have the option to serve in an area linked to heritage, the environment or social care.The programme will cost the French state around \u0026euro1.6 billion (\u0026pound1.4bn) a year to run, with \u0026euro1.75 billion (\u0026pound1.54bn) of investment up front.

Definitely, a real connection.”Who, of course, apart from Adam, who was going to be trouble from the moment he introduced himself as: “Not the serious man you see on Instagram.”A personal trainer unencumbered then by the flab of self-doubt who’s got a hint of the Blutos about him and flags up the moments he’s about to be cocky by ­saying: “Not being cocky but . . .”You can’t argue with the female ­reaction, though. Kendall, Megan, Rosie and Zara have all fallen for the swaggering great berk and Adam’s dumped all but the last of them with a smirk of self-satisfaction.As a way of endearing yourself to the core audience, it’s not good. As reality TV baddies go, however, he’s gold.It was inevitable then, I suppose, the fun police would also start taking an interest in him.Sure enough, there they were above the caption “Is Adam’s behaviour unacceptable?” on Thursday’s This Morning, where Katie Ghose, from Women’s Aid — who you’d hope had better stuff to do — was claiming: “Adam’s behaviour is a form of emotional abuse.”It didn’t take a genius to make the obvious point here. It took Towie’s Lauren Goodger, who said: “It’s just a TV show” and Adam’s merely taken the ­multiple dating rules at face value.So, if you have a genuine moral objection, take it up with ITV rather than feeding their publicity machine.Personally, I don’t. I have, though, had a nagging sense something was missing from this year’s run and it wasn’t until last week I worked out what it was either. The opposition.Big Brother, which is normally, head-to-head with Love Island, has disappeared and, I can almost guarantee, none of you have noticed or regretted its absence either.So not only has Love Island been funny, entertaining, immune to political correctness and proved a point, it’s removed the pox of Big Brother in the process.And if that isn’t public service broadcasting of the highest order and worthy of a plug, I dunno what is, frankly.The BBC failing to put Mark Lawrenson out of his obvious misery. Gary Lineker using apparently random World Cup trivia to draw attention to his goal-scoring exploits.The main BBC News actually doorstepping Lord Sugar over one stupid bladdy Tweet.This Morning’s Russell Grant spraying his astrological BS all over Love Island with the claim: “Rosie gave way to Adam too quickly ’cos of Mars in Venus and Venus and Leo.”And host Phillip Schofield failing to deliver the very obvious response: “Your head in Uranus.” TIME was, BBC comedy would make fun of Rick from The Young Ones, and all his ridiculous right-on pretensions.These days he’s running the show, in the guise of a man called Shane Allen who, not withstanding a thousand layers of state bureaucracy, has the easiest mission statement in television – make the viewers laugh.Apparently not, though. According to Shane, running BBC comedy these days is about finding “the diversity story”.Which sounds a bit like awarding the World Cup trophy to Switzerland, on the grounds of the squad’s ethnic mix.Except he doesn’t really mean diversity. It’s just those groups the BBC likes that Shane wants to employ, having made it abundantly clear “Oxbridge white blokes”, who’ve punched well above their weight, historically, are no longer required.So, at a stroke, you deny yourself any chance of finding talents and shows as brilliant, era-defining and clever as Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G/Borat), Pete and Dud, Python, Fawlty Towers, Jimmy Carr, Fry \u0026amp Laurie, The Goodies and Not The Nine O’Clock News, while still very much lumbering us with the likes of Mel \u0026amp Sue, Famalam and Tittybangbang.For the privilege of institutionalising this failure and replacing an imagined prejudice with a very real one, I’ve also just learned we pay the BBC’s Head of Comedy £208,000 a year.Laugh?I didn’t.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “What South American country comes first alphabetically?”Mark: “Zimbabwe.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “Beginning with the letter J, what word means liquid extracted from fruit?”Carroll: “Glucose.”Andrew O’Keefe: “What sedimentary rock is an anagram of the word leash?”Karen: “Coal.”And Andrew O’Keefe: “Which wig-shaped New York building was ­constructed in 1902?”Hat: “Trump Tower.”No, but I like the way you’re thinking, Hat.NEXT up from BBC2’s department of really dumb ideas?You take two of the greatest and most original comic talents of the last 30 years, Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse.And send them bloody fishing.A combination which, in terms of things I don’t want to watch, is right up there with Vic Reeves \u0026amp Harry Enfield restoring vintage cars and Mel \u0026amp Sue attempting stand-up comedy.Mind you, the point of Gone Fishing also seemed lost on Bob Mortimer, as he trudged off to a Norfolk lake, angling for tench and asking his new mate: “What do we hope to achieve by the end of this, Paul?”Long pause.“A bit of inner peace?”What’s in it for the viewers became less and less clear as the silent pauses became longer.To the extent that, if you were lucky, Gone Fishing may just have been television to fall asleep to.If you weren’t, the last thing you may ever have heard was Bob asking: “Anything, Paul?”“No. Nothing.”On the plus side, though, corpses will have missed the moment where the BBC suddenly abandoned the fishing trip and, genuinely (I’m not making this bit up) sent Bob and Paul to a local micro-brewery.The resulting p***-up, you might not be wholly surprised to learn, wasn’t particularly well organised.Lee Dixon: “It’s a must-win game and Germany need at least a draw.”Phil Neville: “Mexico thoroughly deserve their 1-0 victory at half time.”Pablo Zabaleta: “At 3-1 down Tunisia need a goal to equalise the game.”Jason Mohammad: “One of the impressive things about Germany, the whole tournament, they were just so German-like.” Compiled by Graham Wray.THIS week’s winner is Sir Reg Holdsworth, in a wig, and Sir Reg Dwight (Elton), in a wig.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And he was right.Likewise when Boris Johnson said “f*** business” after Airbus threatened to pull jobs out of Britain post-Brexit, he wasn’t declaring war on firms that employ thousands of people.He was sick of the complaints from foreign companies with a vested interest in keeping the EU sweet — and in lobbying groups like the CBI which back Brussels over Britain.Of course the Tories are keen to ensure Brexit does as little damage as possible to businesses. Job-creation has been their biggest success since 2010.And of course the lack of certainty is worrying some firms. But they, in turn, need to understand this Government’s duty to honour the referendum in full.It cannot abandon red-line commitments — to end free movement, or to trade independently around the world — because big companies which have thrived within the EU don’t like them.Brussels is used to riding roughshod over inconvenient votes. That cannot and must not happen here.The sooner the EU’s corporate supporters grasp it the better.WHY is it OK for every country but England to show off their national pride?The Scots, Welsh, Irish, French, Americans — they love to see their flags adorning homes, offices and streets.Here, the left has made it borderline shameful to put up a St George cross. To them it means you’re parochial and even racist.It is time we killed off that myth and showed the same pride in our flag as the world does in theirs.What better time to start than with Harry Kane’s boys off to a flier in Russia? And where better than the full length of Whitehall?This brilliant idea by ex-Tory minister Nick Boles just needs Theresa May’s nod.Come on, PM . . . get cracking.THE Tories must honour their election vow to protect our troops from witch-hunts.The PM should read the letter from four ex-Cabinet ministers and act.It is a national disgrace that her Government lets veterans be hounded over action they took decades ago in the heat of battle.Our Boys would be right to doubt the Tories’ commitment to them.But at least Labour is not in power.Just one of its MPs turned up to debate bringing in a vital time limit on prosecutions.

And, indeed, free trade is what most people thought they were ­voting for in the 2016 referendum.Free trade, cunningly styled “no deal” by pro-Remain spin doctors, has always been the best option, but has become even more attractive, now that the intransigence and arrogance of EU ­negotiators has become clear.Fair play, Theresa May and David Davis — you gave the negotiations with the EU your best shot but it’s now time to take the road to freedom.Carping critics say they could have done better, but the public instinctively knows that you’ve tried hard and that it takes two to tango.So, let’s be bold and scrap all tariffs on Brexit day, March 29, 2019.It will immediately boost living ­standards, by reducing prices, and will be especially beneficial for the less well-off. Juncker will cry into his claret at the new, competitive UK.Even companies such as BMW and Airbus, which urged us to join the euro and asked their workers to vote Remain, will benefit.Their engines, and other components imported from the EU, would continue to be free of tariffs. However, ­components from outside the EU would also become tariff-free, which is not usually the case today. Not only that, but their workers would be better off too, which is a plus for any business.And instead of sending £39billion into Brussels’ unaudited coffers, let’s invest the money here.Dividing it equally among our 650 MPs would allow each one to spend £60million in their constituency, on local projects. If MPs don’t like that suggestion, the £39billion could instead be used to reduce taxes or government debt. Our democratically elected Parliament can debate the best approach and decide.Most of us understand Chancellor Philip Hammond’s dogged attempts to get public expenditure under control, after the trauma of the credit crunch.But, it must make sense to invest this money in the UK, rather than the EU.Finally, free of Juncker’s shackles, we can regain control of our fishing waters, boosting the morale and income of our beleaguered coastal communities.No longer will 60 per cent of fish in UK waters be landed by EU boats.The public, too, has its role to play now. Project Fear, promoted by the CBI, the Financial Times and big businesses, has tried to frighten us with threats of gridlocked Channel ports and lorry parks across Kent when we leave the EU.Few believe them, but let’s call their bluff. UK consumers and businesses should now start to favour and prefer non-EU and British products wherever possible, dramatically reducing pressure on those ports.Wetherspoon has started by swapping champagne for UK and Aussie sparkling wine, and German wheat beer for the English and Welsh equivalent.As a result of this tactic, the public is benefitting from equal or better quality and lower prices. And there are a large number of other EU products that can be replaced in all pubs and supermarkets in the next year or two.The public instinctively understands the benefits of world trade, so let’s make buying non-EU a national goal for the next few years.It’s tough on our excellent EU ­suppliers, of course, but that’s the price the continent is paying, unfortunately, for a failing and undemocratic system, with unelected apparatchiks like Juncker and Barnier in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Should any new information come to light, this will be explored.”Olivier said the woman - who has chosen to remain anonymous - was screaming “why me?” after she was shoved into the path of the bus.About 15 minutes after the incident, the jogger came back the other way across the bridge.The victim tried to speak to him but he did not acknowledge her and carried on running towards the north side of the river.Responding to the news the notorious Putney Pusher had walked free, Olivier, 45 — commended at the UK Bus Awards for his life-saving reactions — told the Sun: “I think the police have done all they can do, but it’s sad he will not be caught.“He should hand himself in. He needs to face up to what he’s done. What made him do what he did?”Colin Sutton, a retired detective chief inspector who solved some of the Mets most notorious crimes, said little could be done with limited money and resources.He said: “Something that high profile and potentially as dangerous as this, ten years ago, would have had a different level of attention.Roy Ramm, a former Scotland Yard commander, added: “Somebody will know who this jogger is and perhaps one or two years down the line circumstances might change and they will come forward, but that’s the only remaining possibility that this case will be solved.”- The woman was pushed into the path of an oncoming bus by the jogger in Putney Bridge on May 5 last year – yet the politan Police only launched an appeal for information regarding the identity of the middle-aged man THREE MONTHS after the incident.- In August, two 41-year-old men were arrested in connection with the investigation but were both released without charge. One of the men, millionaire banker Eric Bellquist, hit out at cops for implicating him in the “abhorrent” crime when he was 5,000 miles away in California.- He was forced into hiding and was under the protection of ex-SAS veterans after becoming a figure of hate when he was implicated in the crime.- A third man, aged 49, was arrested in Aberdeen in October but was also released with no further action.Do YOU know who the Putney Pusher is?

And for the sake of society, it is absolutely right that this twisted soul was sentenced to life and should remain behind bars for decades.But the truth is that Kouider is not your average female inmate. In fact, she’s almost one of a kind.In the age of “equality”, it’s not fashionable to say that men and women are ­different. But when it comes to ­criminality, there can be no argument.Women make up a ­vanishingly small minority of those in the criminal justice system, representing less than five per cent — and in all but the most exceptional of ­circumstances, the crimes that get them incarcerated are, to put it plainly, petty.In 2016, more women were sent to prison to serve a sentence for theft than for violence against the person, robbery, sexual offences, fraud, drugs and ­motoring offences combined — and 80 per cent of those locked up for theft were shoplifters.In the past decade, the number of ­community sentences for women has fallen by nearly half. In 2016 alone, 8,447 women were put behind bars, depriving around 20,000 children of their mothers.These children will now be shunted around family members or placed in care, eating up even more limited resources than the £36,000 it costs to imprison someone for a year.And they will be stigmatised, probably for life, through no fault of their own. Whatever the macho “tough on crime” politicians say, it is plain that nothing is achieved by locking up women for minor offences.If we want to avoid pouring more of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash down the black hole of the broken prison ­system, we need to stop lumping ­vulnerable women in with violent men and start confronting the complex ­reasons behind their rare appearances in the ­justice system.Research shows that women in prison have often been victims of much more serious offences than the ones they are accused of committing.More than half report having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse as a child compared to under a third of men behind bars — and 57 per cent report having been ­victims of domestic violence.Depressingly, because many women fear disclosing abuse, both figures are likely to be an underestimate.The abusers, it would seem, are also the ones pushing their female partners into a life of crime.Nearly half of women in prison (48 per cent) questioned for the Surveying ­Prisoner Crime Reduction survey reported having ­committed offences to support someone else’s drug use, ­compared to just 22 per cent of men.Manipulated, under-educated and all but broken, these women suddenly ­surface in the criminal justice system, ­desperate for the help which would enable them to put their lives back on track.But instead of offering it, we treat them just the same as the low-lives who ground them down in the first place.And it’s creating a cycle of crime.Overall, 48 per cent of women leaving prison are reconvicted within one year.For those serving sentences of less than 12 months, the reconviction rate rises to 61 per cent.This statistic is hardly surprising when you bear in mind that many women lose everything as a result of imprisonment, and 60 per cent of them don’t have homes to go to on release.Without accommodation, it is much harder to get a job or training ­placement, or arrange benefits or care for children so, understandably, they turn back to petty crime.Women like Kouider must always be locked away and no one is suggesting for one moment that serious crimes should go unpunished. But when you have nearly half of all women in jail to support the drug use of someone else and nearly half having attempted suicide at some point in their lifetime — a figure more than seven times higher than that of the general population — it would very much suggest that ­incarceration is not the wisest response.And at last, the Government is latching on. Justice Secretary David Gauke has now abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales. Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation.It may be a small step — vulnerable men are still at risk of falling through the net and Gauke must address that, too — but it’s in the right direction.If we are to stop our shuddering prison system from imploding entirely, we must start by separating the victims from the criminals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, and across the globe. Pourquoi? (That means “why” and is usually accompanied by a shrug and slightly hysterical hand gestures.)Fewer and fewer British kids are learning French in school. The number studying this absurd language has dropped by 30,000 in the past seven years. Instead, our children are learning languages which might actually prove to be useful later on in life.French is useful only if you visit France — and even then they’ll pretend not to understand you.Oh, and a small bunch of arid and desolate African countries which — trust me on this — you are never going to visit. Unless you want a dose of the Ebola virus or your head chopped off. French does not make the top ten of languages spoken worldwide.It only just crawls into the top 20 — between Marathi and Korean, since you asked. Marathi is spoken by some people in India. Not a huge amount of people, frankly. Nice people though, I’m sure.The Africans have learned the utter uselessness of French.In the past few years two countries from that continent have ditched French as the second language and replaced it with — of course — English. That’s Rwanda and Gabon. The switch has proved very popular indeed. More countries are set to follow suit.Do you know where else they don’t speak French any more? France. Well, in French universities. Science subjects such as physics and maths are taught in English.This is because foreign students coming to France don’t want to have to encumber themselves by learning a new language which will be of less use to them later than Swahili or Gaelic.This has been too long in coming. Right now, more and more British schools are switching to Spanish.This makes sense because while 437million people in the world speak Spanish as a first language — i.e. Spain, Central and most of South America — only about 75million speak French.That’s France, half of Belgium and about nine people in Switzerland.But never mind Spanish, important though it is. Foreign languages are too often neglected by British students.And yet we need them to compete in the world. English is the international language of commerce and culture, sure.I would make it compulsory for kids to learn Mandarin from the age of five. And as a second choice, Spanish — which we’re getting good at — or Arabic.Hell, we could do with knowing what that lot are up to. Our security services have struggled because too few English people have any knowledge of Arabic.And how about Russian?We need a bit of a revolution in the way we teach foreign languages here.For too long we have glided by thinking we need to learn nothing. Just a verse or two of Frere Jacques, that’ll do.But the world is changing and our schools need to change with it.Right now they are beginning to do so, but too slowly.Get the kids learning stuff which will help them compete in the world. And shove French in the trash can of history.Ding dang dong, indeed.THE wags seem to have had a nice night out in St Petersburg.Good for them.I do miss Abbey Clancy from the line-up, though.I suppose it would be a bit much to put Peter Crouch up front just so we got a chance to see her again.JUST as the England team looks like it’s going places and everyone’s happy, there’s a beer shortage.This is because of a national shortage of carbon dioxide.How the hell can we have a shortage of THAT?Your average human breathes out almost three pounds of the stuff every day.This is a national crisis and I think I have the answer.We need to get some people who are of no other use to the world to sit in vast vats of flat lager, belching continuously.Diane Abbott, for example.Humans involved in strenuous exercise exhale even more CO2 – maybe 12 pounds a day. So, Diane, on a treadmill, in a vast vat of lager, belching continuously. Yum.SO, the adolescent, unemployable liberal scumbags are still trying to get Donald Trump’s visit to the UK cancelled.Lefties who cannot bear to hear people express different views to their own will be staging infantile protests across London.There are even plans to have a giant blimp of the US president flying across the capital.A typically nasty and childish little prank by people who cannot abide democracy.And who do not care that the US is our major ally – and especially important once we have left the European Union.The protests are being supported by such organisations as ActionAid, which calls itself a charity.Make sure you never give those people any of your money.And one more thing, you protestors. You think Trump is only in power for four years? Think again. He will win again.Just as other populists are winning elections across Europe.The liberals have lost the argument and they are losing at the polls.NOTHING has given me as much pleasure during the World Cup as watching that fat, cheating coke-head Diego Maradona being hauled out of his seat, drunk out of his skull and incapable of standing.Hand of God – yeah. And the septum of Danniella Westbrook.The only downside was that the Argies won their game against Nigeria, undeservedly. They now face France in the next round.Argentina versus France. Like deciding who you want to win in a fist fight between Jeremy Corbyn and Nick Clegg. You kind of hope they’ll annihilate each other and no team goes through.It’s been a great World Cup so far, and very well run by the Russians. Best teams? Croatia, certainly.

Who would have thought?Did he mention that Airbus, who have been warning of plague and pestilence if we dare to leave, have just been found to have received illegal subsidies worth £17billion from . . . the EU?Did he tell his audience that even Financial Times bosses — a paper so comfortable in Brussels’ bosom it could redesign its masthead as a blue-and-yellow brassiere — think German car manufacturers need a UK trade deal, regardless of what BMW say? Did he heck.Big businesses have done very well out of the EU for years. They’ll resist every possible attempt to reform it or improve it and in Greg Clark they’ve got a man unimaginative enough to believe everything they say.There are plenty of other businesses who are looking to the future with confidence and are excited about Britain striking out on their own.And those outfits who are complaining about Brexit will adjust, just as they did when we (thankfully) didn’t join the Euro, because we’ve got the fifth largest economy in the world and they’d be mad to turn their back on us.It’s time the PM backed Brexit voters over corporate doom-mongers.LOVE Island’s Adam is a nasty piece of work.How ITV can justify him still being on the show despite being caught sending sleazy messages to a 17-year-old girl is beyond us.People have been thrown off for much less. ITV’s shameless pursuit of ratings can’t justify him still being there.Boot him.VAR has made the World Cup a much better experience.Rather than arguing about decisions in the pub for years afterward, they get sorted out straight away.Yes, there are niggles. But between Neymar’s ludicrous dive and South Korea’s (wonderful) goal, more ­decisions are right than ever before.Dinosaur Premier League bosses should introduce it next season.The only downside is that it might have ruled out Geoff Hurst’s goal in ’66.But today’s probably painful enough for our German friends...Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

smashing yesterdays high of 31.9C.Highs were recorded across the UK this afternoon -  making it the first time in five years that temperatures have hit 30C in all four nations of the UK.Met Office meteorologist Bonnie Diamond said: Last year for England there was a warm spell where they had five days over 30C but what makes this current spell different is that its nationwide.Its staying sunny and warm and dry for most (into next week).There is a small risk of seeing some showers developing in the far south-west but otherwise it will be dry.But the heatwave has sparked health warnings with conditions expected to remain hot and sunny over the weekend.The Met Offices heat-health watch alert remains at level two, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.Authorities have also issued warnings to cut shower times down to just four minutes as temperatures continue to sizzle.With no rain on the horizon, the South East is set for its driest June since records began.The last time the area received so little rain was in 1925, recording just 3.4mm.A number of homes were evacuated and pockets of fire continue to burn across an area of around six kilometres, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said.After a very dry month, there is still no rain on the horizon, particularly if the potential thunderstorms fail to materialise this weekend.The heat has already claimed casualties - a 17-year-old boy was recovered from the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search a rescue operation.It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening.Elsewhere the body of 13-year-old Ryan Evans who went missing on Monday after getting into difficulty in Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent was recovered from the water.The body of 31-year-old Edward Savage was also pulled from the water at Mercers Lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday.The heat has caused havoc for commuters after rail services imposed speed limits on trains due to overheating tracks caused by the steel on tracks to expand and sometimes buckle.South Western Railway said temperatures were expected to reach 47C on many parts of its route this week.Services on the London Waterloo to New Malden line are being subjected to speed restrictions from 11am each day until Friday to reduce the likelihood of buckling.A spokesman for the Met Office said: Over the next few days the high pressure will remain so there will be blue skies across the UK and that will last certainly into the weekend.We may see some thunderstorms on Sunday or Monday but nothings certain.But we can expect these sorts of high temperatures to be reached certainly until Saturday.The heatwave could even top a blistering 38C in the coming months, raising fears this summer could be even worse than the Lucifer heatwave last year.The RSPCA also called on pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals in the heat after receiving 625 calls about animals in hot environments between June 11 and 24 -

It obviously got a lot worse.A spokesman for South Central Ambulance Service said on social media: It beggars belief what happened to our staff in Eastleigh.We received a 999 call informing us that a 13-year-old girl was in cardiac arrest.We immediately sent a rapid response car and ambulance but when they arrived they were met by a barrage of bricks, glasses, tables, chairs and other items from the upstairs windows.We of course informed the police as well as sending more staff to the scene as the original vehicles were being damaged and the first responders we had sent were extremely shaken.Police officers then had to gain access to the property to confirm it was a hoax call.The spokesman added that the hoax had diverted emergency resources from others in genuine pain and distress.Lets hope the people taken away by Hampshire Police from the property are having the largest book at the local station thrown in their direction.Paul Jefferies, assistant director of communications at SCAS said: Luckily on this occasion our staff werent physically hurt, but obviously theres the mental and emotional trauma that goes with this.They were very shaken up because its not what you expect."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416705371.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"england flag world cup council remove graves relatives chippenham","story":"Relatives placed the Cross of St George on the graves of Tom Reilly and Nicholas Witts at Chippenham cemetery in Wiltshire last week.But when they returned a few days later, the England flags had been removed by the town council.Nicholas brother Andrew Beavan-Witts, 68, said: Im sure that if it was a foreign flag it would not have been taken down.

Much of this clearing is illegal.Norwegian Environment Minister Ola Elvestuen said the pace of forest losses was catastrophic and threatened efforts to slow global warming.Elvestuen added: Forest destruction is driving climate change... Norway has invested about £2.1billion to safeguard tropical forests in the past decade.Justin Adams of the the Nature Conservancy environmental group said only three per cent of public finance for slowing climate change went to natural solutions like forests.He said well-managed forests can be a source of jobs and economic growth but tree cover is just one measure of the state of the worlds forests.The UNs Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says the loss of forests worldwide slowed to just a net 12,700-square-miles a year from 2010-15.The FAO says that a forest where trees are deliberately felled to make way for new plantings is still a forest but Global Forest Watch registers the felling as tree cover loss.Anssi Pekkarinen, a senior forestry officer of the FAO, said that the FAO method of identifying the underlying land use gives a much more comprehensive picture on the worlds forests."},{"url":null,"title":"kids homework question answer favourite book brutal funny","story":"The boys class was asked whether they would recommend their favourite book to a friend - but the teacher couldnt have predicted how hilariously savage one kids answer would be.Asked if he would recommend his favourite book to a friend, the kid wrote: No, it is my favourite, and I dont want anyone else to have it.His mum couldnt help sharing the boys mischievous answer online, captioning the photo: A tiny piece of writing, all about the love of books and reading ... from my sons homework when he was six.The comical post quickly went viral, picking up 27,000 likes and getting retweeted over 4,800 times in 24 hours, including by leading authors J.K.

in a green shirt - pulled her off.The untethered animal - rescued two years ago from being put down by a private zoo in Russia - was reportedly “purring like a cat” although this is something lions are supposed not to be able to do.Two other unchained male lions are nearby as the video was shot.The astonishing scene is from the Taigan Safari Park in Crimea, annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014.Zubkov allows visitors to mix with big cats in scenes that defy normal health and safety rules and would be forbidden elsewhere.“If a giant lioness jumps into your arms while you drive around Safari park, and purrs like a cat, then you can be sure that this is Lola from Chelyabinsk,” said Safari park director Tatiana Aleksagina.“Life in the park has transformed her into one of the kindest wild animals we’ve seen. “She just gave birth to her first cub, a lioness we called Lilu, and she loves coming to say hello to tourists.“In fact, she is so passionate in jumping into safari bus with kisses and hugs that many tourists can’t handle it.They can’t believe that all Lola wants to do is kiss and hug.”Yet when she arrived at the park after being neglected at the zoo which was poised to put her down - because they couldn’t afford to feed her - she was hostile to people.But she was tamed by Zubkov, who insists his animals will not harm tourists and that they are safe if accompanying him.The lioness was rescued by Karen Dallakyan, a vet and animal shelter owner in Chelyabinsk.“Lola was in horrible condition after being fed with too much cheap cooked meals like porridge,” he said.“A huge tummy didn’t let her jump, and her joints ached from carrying extra weight.“She had to go through a strict diet and in a matter of weeks she started to move around and jump, like any young animal is supposed to do.“We knew from the start that Lola could not stay with us, as our open air shelter in Chelyabinsk was too cold for her.“We got in touch to lions shelters around the world in Mexico, Sochi and Crimea.“Taigan Safari Park was the first one to respond.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dog trapped inside lorry mcdonalds 40 minutes honks horn","story":"A witness claimed they saw the little pooch locked in the vehicle as temperatures reached a scorching 27C outside a McDonalds in Somerset.Teen Gabrielle Dart said she had heard the vehicles horn beeping as it sat outside the Frome branch of the fast food chain.Speaking to Somerset Live, the 17-year-old said: We heard a car horn which kept going off and realised it was the dog honking the horn.So I took some photos, got the manager and alerted them.The rush to help the dog comes after cops were forced to break into a blazing hot car to rescue two dogs left in a car by their owner in York.The York officers involved in the rescue attempt said even they were struggling to breathe as they worked to free the dogs from the car.Gabrielle said she was horrified to see the dog locked in the car in Somerset on Monday, June 25.She claimed a window had been opened a crack.The teen said she had notified a local shop manager but when they returned to the car park, the lorry and dog had gone.According to the RSPCA, Britons could end up with a criminal record if something happens to their dog after its left alone in a car.It is not illegal to leave a pet unattended in a vehicle.But if the animal becomes ill or dies as a result, you could be charged with animal cruelty.If convicted under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, drivers can be jailed for six months and slapped with an unlimited fine.A car sitting in 24C conditions outside can reach 34C in just ten minutes, and a dangerous 43C after half an hour -

These are likely to go unfulfilled, because he flaunts them so crassly.Yet before acknowledging that the Armed Forces need more money, which they do, we should recognise how hard it is to configure Britain’s defence and security posture at a time when threats and the means to address them are changing at awesome speed.Countering terrorism in some ways represents the least ­difficult element, because it is the only peril the public really cares about.It is evident to all save ­disciples of Julian Assange that electronic surveillance through GCHQ, supported by the intelligence services, armed police and military special forces, deserves generous funding, which it nowadays receives.It is much more difficult to identify the appropriate tools with which to equip the Armed Forces to meet the strategic threats, of which Russia ­represents the most obvious.When President Putin favours hybrid warfare embracing covert special forces, fake news, cyber attacks and subversion, are tanks and infantry battalions the appropriate responses?When US backing for Nato is wavering and key nations such as Germany forswear a serious combat capability, alongside what allies can we hope to present a common front?These are big and hard ­questions.A couple of months ago at a round-table dinner, some of Britain’s top generals and ­strategic gurus held forth about the threats as they see them.Afterwards, the former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who was among the guests, told me that he had been disappointed by the ­unoriginality of the ideas expressed.Here were the brightest and best in the war studies ­universe, he suggested, still thinking inside the parameters of the familiar, when much that is unfamiliar is evolving all around us.In planning for the future, Army commanders deserve sympathy, because they are compelled to observe ­constraints imposed by public sentimentality, to which ­ministers make obeisance.For instance, the chronically under-recruited Scottish regiments should be reduced, instead of having their ranks filled with Fijians (yes, really), but that is politically unthinkable.Nobody dares to axe a foot guards battalion, because the Guards Division remains a powerful trades union.The Gurkhas, whose infrastructure and dependants’ costs now make them uneconomic, cannot be touched because no minister will risk Joanna ­Lumley once more taking to the streets on their behalf. ­Politicians, in their own defence, are entitled to point out that the leaders of the Armed Forces are often poor judges of strategic planning.The admirals of two decades ago begged, fought and pleaded for the Navy’s two preposterous carriers, which I have compared to the Egyptian pyramids — huge consumers of resources for negligible practical utility.It was always obvious that the F-35 aircraft for which they were designed are properly unaffordable by modern Britain.Beyond being described by Americans as “the planes that ate the Pentagon” because of their fantastic cost, recent assessments show them ­performing poorly in the key ground attack role, as do the RAF’s Typhoons, conceived as high-altitude interceptors.Moreover, it was always plain that almost the entire Royal Navy’s residual strength will be required to escort the carriers on active service, while they are incapable of inshore operation.A strong government and Defence Secretary would mothball the behemoths in a display of courage such as was last shown by Denis Healey in 1968 when he decided to withdraw British forces from east of Suez.Forces need more of almost everythingThey would also scrap the Trident deterrent replacement, again a big willy gesture for a little willy nation, inappropriate to our diminished status in the world.I know almost no one whom I respect in the defence loop — military or civilian — who favours trying to sustain a nuclear capability on the ­Trident scale.More money must be found to recruit, train and exercise a credible Army.The only certainty about ­Britain’s defence needs is that more soldiers are wanted, to meet a range of future threats.Something much more serious than the fanatics of IS could well confront Britain in the coming decades.American military friends often remind me that Britain’s Armed Forces today command respect neither from friends nor foes.I remember General Sir Mike Jackson saying ­ruefully, as head of the Army 12 years ago: “Mass matters, and we don’t have it.”Our rulers may sometimes be forgiven for lying to us, but should never be forgiven for lying to themselves, as ­members of this Government do repeatedly.Bits of Britain’s Armed Forces are still superb, but it will not do for ministers merely to keep reciting the tired mantra about how terrific the SAS is.This is a niche force, no more capable of frightening Russia or China than the England cricket team.Gavin Williamson is dead right, that our Armed Forces need more of almost everything.Such a pity, then, that he himself has no more credibility at Westminster than an England cricket coach.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A third of pension pots were being accessed without any advice being taken.The FCA added: \"We have seen that many consumers, particularly when focused on taking their tax-free cash (a quarter of a retiree\u0027s pension pot may be accessed on a tax-free basis), take the \u0027path of least resistance\u0027 and enter drawdown with their existing provider.\"We expect levels of engagement to increase over time as pot sizes grow.\"However, as pots become bigger, those who do not engage effectively could lose out on income in retirement, through poor investment choices or paying higher fees and charges.\"Central to what the FCA is proposing is more information that sets out to consumers how to access their pension pot, what their options are, and whether they want to buy an annuity or take out a drawdown product.It would provide them with three ready-made drawdown investment solutions, or pathways.The FCA found, preparing the review, that a third of people using drawdown had no hands-on investment experience and that two in five of such people had received no advice.Half of these people who had taken no advice said they had assumed drawdown would be simple. And nearly a third of them claimed they were confident in their investment decisions despite their previous lack of investment experience.There is no doubt that what the FCA is proposing today makes sense.The pensions freedoms have undoubtedly been popular but the proportion of customers not taking any advice is shocking, and so is the evidence on how much more money they could be receiving from their retirement savings were they to do so.That one third of people entering drawdown without taking advice are simply leaving their money in cash beggars belief.No one wants a nanny state but such people need saving from themselves.There is also a need for greater clarity around charges applied to drawdown products.Astonishingly, the FCA found as many as 44 different charges, with the charges themselves ranging from 0.4% to 1.6% a year. The regulator is not currently proposing to cap charges - but it remains an option.This is probably the correct call, for now."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-south-central-ambulance_4347702.jpg?20180628091635 ","title":"ambulance staff pelted with bricks and tables after 999 call","story":"It released an image of the scene, with some of the items that were thrown during the incident scattered on the ground.It said on Facebook on Wednesday: \"It beggars belief what happened to our staff in Eastleigh earlier this evening."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-brigitte-nielsen-actress_4347757.jpg?20180628100835 ","title":"brigitte nielsen 54 releases first picture of new baby frida","story":"Nielsen gave birth to her fifth child at the age of 54.Frida - the star\u0027s first daughter - was born in Los Angeles and weighed 5lbs 9oz.The Red Sonja and Beverly Hills Cop II star and her 39-year-old husband Mattia Dessi told People magazine they were \"overjoyed\" following the birth.\"It\u0027s been a long road, and so worth it.

Government figures show building began on only 160 local authority properties across the WHOLE of England, between January and March. The number of housing association homes started also fell 14%, to 5,230. The drop comes despite Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May’s promise to kick start a council house building blitz. Mrs May declared it was her personal mission to fix the housing crisis and pledged to build 300,000 homes a year overall by the mid-2020s. Yet just 39,350 homes started being built in the three months to March - a fall of 8% on a year earlier.  For the last full year that figure was 157,480, down 3% on the year before. The number of homes completed was also down, despite a chronic housing shortage. The drop was blamed in large part on severe weather at the end of winter which forced house builders to down tools. The period from 1946 through to the 1980s saw a boom in council house building. But that changed with the growth in housing associations, which coincided with Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s right to buy scheme.

Josephine Iyamu used a powerful witch doctor to exert a control over her victims. The 53-year-old was a ringleader of an international human trafficking crime network and lived in a huge Nigerian mansion complete with a servants’ quarters. She used the profits to fund her lavish lifestyle including jaunts to Europe to buy \u0026pound700 designer shoes. Iyamu charged each of her victims up to €38,000 - more than \u0026pound33,600 - to arrange for their travel to Europe. She would first make the vulnerable women undergo Juju ceremonies which would involve them drinking blood containing worms and eating the heart of a chicken.  The victims would then be forced to endure an arduous five day journey to the Libyan coast - which saw them shot at, ambushed and gang raped. They would then catch an inflatable boat crammed with hundreds of people to Italy before being moved into Germany to work as prostitutes. German police identified Iyamu as the ringleader of a Nigerian human trafficking operation after a brothel owner reported suspicions over one of his workers’ paperwork last January. Iyamu and her husband Efe Ali-Imaghodor, 60, were arrested at Heathrow Airport on August 24 last year after travelling back from Nigeria. Mr Ali-Imaghodor was cleared of one count of perverting the course of justice. Police found Iyamu in possession of seven mobile phones and more than 30 SIM cards linked them to the German investigation. Officers also discovered a piece of paper detailing a list of items needed as part of the Juju ceremonies and another with telephone numbers of criminal associates. Iyamu was today convicted by a jury on five counts of arranging to facilitate travel of another person for exploitation, following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court. She was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice after paying Nigerian police to arrest one of the victims’ relatives in a bid to stop the woman giving evidence against them in the trial while both were in police custody in the UK. The jury of ten women and one man took 11 hours to return their verdict following the eight-week long trial. Iyamu, who was dressed in a turquoise shawl, held her hand to her mouth bowed her head as the verdict was read out. Judge Richard Bond said: “This is the first case in England and Wales under the new 2015 act whereby people have been trafficked from one country into another country.  “This is going to set a precedent when it comes to sentence. Whatever sentence I impose, I anticipate it will be challenged.” Iyamu - aka \u0027Madam Sandra\u0027 - had worked 37 days in 2016/17 as an agency nurse in south east London hospitals for NHS Capitol Staffing Services. She lived with husband Ali-Imaghodor, a cloakroom attendant, in an ex-council home in Bermondsey, south east London. The National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation found the victims - aged 24 to 30 - were made to undergo Juju rituals which exercised a control tighter than chains. They were so terrified by the threat of voodoo magic that they had to undergo another black magic “revokation” ceremony to undo the oath they took to pay Iyamu. Kay Mellor, NCA senior investigating officer, said Iyamu, originally from Liberia, became a British citizen in 2009 - which allowed her to be prosecuted under section 2 of the Modern Slavery Act. The officer explained she is the first British national to be convicted of human trafficking crimes not involving British victims and which were not committed in the country. She said: “Since 2009 she was a British citizen which allows us therefore to use the legislation of the Modern Slavery Act. “She was a registered nurse, she was an agency nurse and that totally goes against for me what a nurse is - somebody who looks after people, who makes them better and certainly what she was doing was totally opposed to what in my mind a nurse should be.” The trafficking investigation - Operation Redroot - began after one victim was arrested and told German police of Iyamu’s crimes - who then wire-tapped the victims’ mobile phones. The prostitute last January told German police she was born into a “relatively poor family” in Nigeria and was told she could earn huge amounts of money working as a prostitute in Europe.  Ms Mellor said: In return of making those arrangements she has charged them an enormous amount of money and by working as prostitutes these would need to repay their debts. “They agreed that they wanted to travel to Europe but in order to they had to go through a Juju ceremony.” The officer explained Juju was a form of voodoo with “highly respected” priests in West Africa and added: “They exert an insidious control which an expert witness has said is more powerful than chains. The Nigerian victims visited the priest multiple times and for up to a week as part of the oath-swearing ceremony. Describing the ceremony, the officer added: “They were given blood containing worms to drink. A chicken was used to hit her naked body on the back and on the chest. “She had to eat the heart of the chicken which had just been killed. “And the priest would cut their skin and mouth with a razor blade.” Iyamu then took snippets of her victims’ head and pubic hair and kept them in individualised packages and “she told the girls, ‘You have now eaten from the devil and if you do not pay, the devil will kill you\u0027.” The victims would then undertake a “horrendous” journey across the Sahara desert from Nigeria to the Libyan coast. “During that journey the bus was shot at, hi-jacked, sometimes they had to travel across the desert on foot. “It could be up to two weeks before an inflatable boat could come to take them to Italy. The victims were moved to a migration camp in Verona before being given false identification papers allowing them to travel to Germany where brothels are legal.

The small canine was spotted apparently locked in the truck amid 27C temperatures outside the fast food restaurant on Monday.  In footage captured by a teenager, it could be seen looking upwards, with its mouth open, from inside the vehicle in Somerset. Gabrielle Dart, 17, who filmed the dog, noticed a horn repeatedly sounding while visiting the chain\u0027s Frome branch with her mum.  She raised the alarm and claims that the animal was left inside the truck for about 40 minutes in the heat, Somerset Live reports.   The teenager, who lives in Bruton, said: “We heard a car horn which kept going off and realised it was the dog honking the horn. “So I took some photos, got the manager and alerted them.” Gabrielle and the restaurant manager apparently decided to report the \u0027trapped\u0027 dog to the police, while hoping its owner quickly returned. They went indoors to call officers, but it is claimed that when the teenager next checked the car park, the truck with the dog had gone. Gabrielle posted about the incident on social media, alleging that an open crack had been left in the window of the vehicle.   She claimed on Facebook : “Hello everyone, can someone please tell me who owns this vehicle as they left there dog in there car for around 40mins in 27 degrees heat! (sic) This is unacceptable!   Do people not understand dogs are incapable of sweating. But people think this is okay because they left a crack in the window.”  Gabrielle said she believes the McDonald’s manager reported the incident to the police after she raised the alarm. Somerset Live contacted the Frome branch, but staff on duty yesterday were not aware of the incident two days earlier. Gabrielle’s photos and video of the dog come after several reports of dogs being left inside cars in the West Country.

After noticing what he thought was a stubborn pimple on his forehead, Colin Davies, 66, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of skin cancer .  Despite starting at the size of a grape, Colin\u0027s skin cancer \u0027spot\u0027 continued to grow and eventually took over his head - spreading to his neck, jaw, ear and right shoulder with the deadly cancer. Colin, from Hartlepool, County Durham, underwent 13-hour surgery to remove three large tumours, and had his left ear, ear canal, part of his lower jaw, neck and shoulder muscle removed.  He also needed part of his scalp removed and replaced with an acrylic plate and a skin graft from his leg, alongside rotating his scalp by 180 degrees and then underwent six weeks of intensive radiotherapy to eradicate the cancer. Colin is speaking out about his ordeal with the disease to encourage people to stay protected and out of the sun this summer. Thankfully the doting granddad is now cancer-free and looking forward to the future with his family. Pensioner Colin said: If the spot hadn\u0027t of been in the middle of my forehead, it could\u0027ve gone unnoticed and it probably would\u0027ve killed me. I\u0027ve had to battle with the cancer for over 25 years as almost every year another cancerous tumour develops, which has resulted in intensive surgery.  I\u0027ve had to have my body completely changed - I\u0027ve lost my ear, part of my jaw and my scalp has been completely stripped and given new skin. I only spent my younger years in the sun, but the skin cancer still ravaged me - which is why I am issuing this warning so people realise they\u0027re not invincible. Despite only having spent time in the sun when he would go on fishing trips as a child, Colin\u0027s skin cancer wasn\u0027t diagnosed until he was 41 years old. Now Colin will be spending his summer inside, as going outside in the sun could cause his cancer to return or his skin graft to burn through to the bone.  My doctor told me that he believes it was my years as a child going fishing in the sun that\u0027s caused the cancer, he said. I had continual checks on the spot for two years before I was diagnosed, but when it was tough, sore and itchy I knew that it was cancer. So that\u0027s when I went to the doctor and had the spot removed, but the cancer was growing fast and soon took over my entire head. As the cancer continued to move I had to have more of my body removed - including an amputation on my ear, which has now been replaced by a prosthetic, and part of my skull being replaced by an acrylic plate. After spending 25 years of my life in and out of hospital, getting the all clear and then the cancer coming back, I won\u0027t even risk going out in the sun now.

On Wednesday, June 13, a council employee rang him but forgot to hang up the call, leaving a four minute long voicemail message of his conversation with a colleague. James was shocked to hear the man making fun of him when he listened back to the accidental recording. Having failed to get to speak to him, the council worker is overheard being told by another member of staff to email James. The man on the phone, who doesn’t realise he is leaving a voicemail, comments: “That will wind him up” and “That will f***ing rile him”.  The caller then starts joking with a colleague, talking about how the Green Cross Code Man was the voice of Darth Vader in Star Wars. Kirklees Council has denied the offensive comments were directed at James. However, James disagrees as he says he had told a manager in the department to email him during a previous call, as he cannot break off from his work to answer the phone. James said: “All I was complaining about was roadworks. Instead of an apology I got that. “I just wanted to know why they’d done them both at the same time as it seems pretty inconsiderate to residents, but receiving that voicemail took my frustration to the next level.” James said all he wanted from council chiefs now was an apology and an explanation to his two month old inquiry.  Karl Battersby, Strategic Director for Economy and Infrastructure said: “Unfortunately on this occasion the council failed to deliver the level of customer service that our residents deserve. “Prior to the phone call, the customer had contacted the council to report concerns over the number of roadworks undertaken by utility companies in the Cross Lane/Primrose Hill area. “The customer had requested a call back from the council and this didn’t take place. “When the call was passed through, an officer called back to get some more information. “When the call ended he failed to close the call correctly and conversations in the office were recorded.

But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the rest of the gang are now getting ready for the next big occasion - Prince Louis\u0027s christening . The latest royal baby has been kept out of the spotlight since he was born on April 23. We got a quick look at the fifth in line to the throne as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took him home from the Lindo Wing at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in central London. But his christening will be the first time we\u0027ve seen him in public since. Here\u0027s everything you need to know about the christening....  When and where is the christening taking place? The date to pop in your diary is July 9. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will take the service, which will be held at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace. Louis\u0027 brother George was christened at the Chapel Royal in 2013, while sister Charlotte was christened at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Norfolk in 2015.  Why is July 9 important to the Queen? Go back 71 years and July 9 is the date her majesty, who was then Princess Elizabeth, announced she was engaged to Philip Mountbatten. Even though they were privately engaged for a year before, they didn\u0027t make it public until July 9, 1947. They made the announcement at Buckingham Palace. As is traditional in the royal family, they also released an official photo to mark the occassion. It shows Elizabeth sitting on a chair with Philip sitting on the arm, and they are staring into each others eyes looking very much in love.  The couple married later that year at Westminster Abbey and became the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. As we all remember from Prince William and Harry\u0027s engagement announcements, it\u0027s a big day for any royal so it\u0027s probably still a special day for the Queen. Her majesty is due to attended to attend Louis\u0027s christening, and it\u0027s expected that Prince Philip will be by her side despite retiring from royal duties last year.  What will Louis wear for the christening? Louis will wear a replica of the silk and lace christening gown worn by royal babies since 1841. The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria, and was made of delicate silk and Honiton lace. But after the christening of Prince Edward\u0027s daughter Louise in 2004 it was decided that the original gown was too delicate to be worn. The Queen\u0027s dressmaker Angela Kelly made a replica which was debuted on Louise\u0027s younger brother James in 2008. The same gown was worn by Prince George and Princess Charlotte at their christenings.  Who are the godparents likely to be? Royals typically choose loads of godparents, and it is usually made up of other royals and members of the aristocracy. Louis\u0027 dad Prince William had six godparent - including former King of Greece Constantine II and Princess Alexandra, the Queen’s cousin. Prince George has seven godparents, including Earl Grosvenor, who is one of the wealthiest men on the country and another member of the Royal family, Zara Tindall. As for Louis, nothing has been announced yet, but the bookies have a few favourites. Tiggy Pettifer, Prince William and Prince Harry\u0027s former nanny, leads the pack - with Ladbrokes offering odds of 2/1. William\u0027s outgoing private secretary Miguel Head is another favourite, with odds of 5/4.

With the Queen among those suffering from a summer cold - which can be mistaken for hayfever - here are some of the things you should be looking out for. The monarch was forced to miss a service at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral because she is feeling \u0027under the weather\u0027. This is despite the UK baking in temperatures up to 31.9C, with the heatwave set to continue into the weekend. These are some of the things you should know about summer colds, and most importantly how they should be treated.  Is a summer cold the same as a winter cold? Not quite. Although they have similar symptoms, a summer cold is more likely to be caused by the cold virus, enterovirus, which prefers the milder conditions of summer. During the winter it is usually rhinovirus, which is more prevalent when it is cold. The winter version is characterised by being severe but short-lived, while in the summer it will more often linger, and also has a habit of recurring. What are the symptoms of a summer cold? Summer colds are often mistaken for hay fever . A runny nose, sneezing, cough, congestion and sore throat are common ailments, as in the winter, along with a raised temperature, aching joints and tiredness.

BBC staffer Louisa Lewis says the clips popping up on her Swann Security mobile app showed a kitchen she didn\u0027t recognise and people she didn\u0027t know. The videos showed a man and woman walking by and captured a child\u0027s voice in the background. The incident has sparked privacy concerns about smart security cameras, but Swann Security insists factory and human error were to blame for the data breach and it was a one-off incident. But it was the second incident to occur in as many months. In May, another customer told how video from a pub\u0027s CCTV system was sent to his mobile app by mistake.  The system is designed to send camera footage to an app on a customer\u0027s mobile phone when motion is detected. Notifications pop up on the phone to alert the customer. The videos sent to Ms Lewis automatically downloaded onto her phone and she said the images kept coming even though she had complained to Swann after the initial batch arrived on Saturday. She was told nothing could be done until after the weekend, and they didn\u0027t stop until a BBC journalist contacted a public relations firm which represents Swann on Monday.  Ms Lewis told the BBC: I was out and I had a couple of alerts.  Naturally, I looked at my phone only to see the video was not of my home. At first I ignored it - I thought it must be an error - then I had several other alerts, at which point I thought I had better get in touch with Swann.  She said the clips were mistakenly sent to her phone after her camera\u0027s battery died and was recharged. The family in the videos has not been identified. A spokesperson for Swann, owned by US-based security camera firm Infinova Group, told : Swann takes the security and privacy of our customers very seriously. We are taking corrective action and further investigating this issue as our highest priority. A spokesperson told the BBC that the cameras belonging to Ms Lewis and the family had the same bank-grade security key, and the family ignored a warning message saying the camera was already paired to an account when they linked it to their network. The spokesperson claimed it was a one-off.

Reservoirs dried up, water supply was cut off, schools shut and flames tore through mountains and forests. In the 1976 heatwave, camels even rode through Welsh reservoirs and children rode their bikes on empty river beds. For many people, memories of the drought that year centre around the water shortages caused by dried up reserves. But it was a summer holiday like no other for others, where public fountains became swimming pools and every day was spent at the beach.  This is the story of the summer when Wales ran dry, Wales Online reports. For a year before the big drought temperatures started to rise. The winter before, the UK received less than half of its average rainfall, while at the start of 1976 there were months which saw no rain at all. By April alarm bells started to ring - particularly for Wales\u0027 biggest industry bosses whose factories used million upon million of gallons of water each day. Every day between June 23 to July 7 the temperature in Wales reached 32.2C, with five of those days going above 35C. The hottest day of all was July 3, with temperatures topping 35.9C. With no clouds in the sky, by July 14, 1976, it was time for action.  Taking the lead Welsh National Water Development Authority announced that 400,000 people would have their water supply cut off at night. It also ordered an end to washing cars and the watering of flower beds, tennis courts, bowling greens and golf courses. A week later, Dennis Bowden, the water authority\u0027s senior civil engineer, said the country could be facing a three-day working week. The situation is critical, he said. We are doing everything we can to avoid further cuts, but people are not saving enough and the reservoirs are very low. To help cut any frivolous use of water no shortage of advice was offered to the average Welsh family. The South Wales Echo ran a front page with the headline Water - here\u0027s how YOUR family can save 632 gallons in a week, with a picture of a young family next to a sea of buckets. Suggestions included taking showers instead of baths and watering the garden with dirty dishwater. At the time it became patriotic to have a dirty car, billions of ladybirds swarmed southern England and the only way to flush a toilet was with dirty dish-wash water.  Meanwhile, the South Glamorgan area health authority took a more unusual approach by urging people to use their imagination. It said: People should pretend they are camping or visiting relatives in some part of the country not directly connected to the main water system. The smell of effluent which can\u0027t be flushed away overnight might be awful, but unless there\u0027s a bug already in the house it won\u0027t make any difference to the health situation. By August the number of houses without water at night grew to up to one million, with residents warned it could last for a horrifying 12 weeks. Schools were shut due to health concerns, with no water flowing during the 17-hour cut off period. As the start of the month headlines from the time read like a quaint British comedy.  The drought brought about the advent of the midnight gardener, with families like the Willoughbys of Radyr spotted watering their beds in the dead of night. What they were doing was perfectly legal, taking advantage of a burst main in their road. Children spent every day outside, including those who used Lido in Briton Ferry, the nickname given to a feeder canal. Despite their advice South Glamorgan Health Authority also came under fire after sprayers were spotted in use on Glossop Terrace Maternity Hospital in Cardiff, in defiance of a hosepipe ban. The authority blamed maintenance contractors. Meanwhile, river bailiffs were kept busy by poachers who took advantage of low levels on the Wye to catch salmon left lethargic by a lack of oxygen.  For business, however, it was no laughing matter. In Gwent a total of 70 companies were ordered to halve their water consumption, including coal mines and works owned by British Steel. Warnings of a vegetable famine dominated the headlines, while the National Farmers\u0027 Union described the heat as a dust bowl situation in Wales . The National Coal Board chipped in with some support in August, providing an additional three-quarters of a million gallons a day from an underground source at Llanover, near Blackwood. But it came too late for the BP Chemicals plant in Barry, where 1,800 people worked, which was forced to shut down operations after a 50% cut in supplies.

The high temperatures look set to continue as the Met Office warns that the mercury is still rising. A spokesman for the Met Office said: Over the next few days the high pressure will remain so there will be blue skies across the UK and that will last certainly into the weekend.

But we can expect these sorts of high temperatures to be reached certainly until Saturday. London will see highs on 29C on Friday, 27C on Saturday and 28C on Sunday.  Similar temperatures are forecast for Birmingham and Cardiff with highs of 27C. The bright sunshine means there are extremely high UV levels and people are being warned to wear sun cream. There is a risk of thunderstorms from Sunday caused by the hot, humid conditions with rain forecast in the South West, West England, Wales and parts of Scotland.

Long-suffering Amy Jackson has been ravaged by eczema since birth and has faced bullying and constant flare ups while struggling to complete everyday tasks, such as bathing. Showering can be so painful it leaves the 23-year-old crying out in pain, and she says she feels suicidal.  The disorder causes itchy and inflamed patches of skin, but for Amy, it is truly debilitating, and she is now losing her hair as a result of scalp scratching, reports Hull Live.   “Eczema affects me in so many ways – physically, emotionally and mentally , she said, opening up about her daily struggle.   “I feel absolutely helpless with it – nobody knows the skin that I’m in and I can’t walk away from the illness even for a moment. “There is no way out of it and I often think to myself, can I still be doing this in another 50 years? “I cry every single night with the pain of it and having a shower is agony as my skin is so sore. “I’m emotionally unstable as a result and my eczema completely strains my relationships with my partner and dad. Amy has faced problems with doctors before and has been in hospital many times. As a result, she said feels the condition is not properly reviewed for improvement, like other long term conditions such as diabetes. “I’ve been on steroids to manage my eczema for as long as I can remember even though they are only meant to be a short term solution, which is clear as my skin shows signs of steroid overuse.  “I’ve tried light therapy and all sorts but there is no cure for it. “I’m having to spend a lot of my wages on steroid cream and special shampoo to help with my hair loss, but I know that there are better solutions out there. Amy also thinks that there is not enough support for those suffering with eczema, and that those around her do not fully understand the extent of how serious the condition can be. “It’s so much more than just a red rash,” said Amy. “People tell me to just stop itching, but that’s impossible, as the illness is itching. At times I feel like I’m in a hole, spiralling down and down. Growing up with eczema has also been tough for Amy, as she says that other children did not understand it. “I got bullied at school because of my eczema and other kids didn’t really come near me as they thought that I was infectious, which is completely untrue, she said. “The blood from itching my skin can also ruin bedsheets, so I never got asked to sleepovers.

David Martin filmed Michelle Potter completely losing the plot last week when he challenged her to work out the puzzle at home in Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire. Gallant David then posted the clip to social media - and is now braced for reprisals. In the video, the 29-year-old asks Michelle: “There’s 30 cows in a field and twenty ate chickens, how many didn’t?” The statement is designed to baffle listeners for having a double meaning - in this case “twenty ate” sounds like the number 28.  Hilariously Michelle, 32, is shown jumping to her feet shouting “what do you mean? You’re winding me up” as she struggles for almost five minutes to solve the riddle. Michelle, who works for construction company Carillion, then stands up, shouting at David “Right typical maths, it’s clearly something to do with maths right or you’ve just f****d it up and you’re reading it wrong. “There’s 30 cows in a field and twenty eight chickens so there’s 28 chickens and thirty cows in the field which makes that 58. How many didn’t? Two.” David responds: “You’re not listening to the question” and repeats the riddle again. At this point Michelle takes a few seconds to think and then says two again before David bursts out laughing.  She then smiles before crouching down nearby and asks David: “Okay what were they doing for them not to be doing anything?” “How many of what didn’t? Dave, tell me. 30 cows a field. Nothing wrong with that. 28 chickens...You d***.” A frustrated Michelle then starts laughing before putting her head in her hands while she sits on the ground. Michelle’s 12-year-old daughter Jessica Bostock, who is sat playing Fortnite in the room, can be heard telling the couple the correct answer of 10. But even then Michelle can’t understand why and begins shouting “How do you know it’s 10? How do you know it’s 10 when he isn’t even asking a question?” Michelle then asks “Is it about the egg? What came first?”  The clip then continues for another couple of minutes as Michelle gets more and more frustrated with David. At one point, Michelle grabs a plastic cup and plastic gun toy and throws it at her wind-up boyfriend saying: “You’re just trying to be a k***head. Trying to make me look like a f****** r****d.” Jessica explains the riddle to Michelle but she still struggles to understand it because David “didn’t even mention the cows eating the chickens”. The clip ends with Michelle repeating the riddle over and over trying to work it out. Speaking today, David, a store manager at Greggs, said: “I think I’ve started something.

Cindie Allen-Stewart, from Texas, would slather herself in sunscreen only to find she was still getting burnt. She tried numerous methods to ease the pain and redness with no luck, until finally trying one her mother-in-law suggested - and now she swears by it. The home remedy treatment, which she has been using for the past 10 years and takes just minutes, involves shaving cream and she says \u0027works wonders\u0027.  In a Facebook post which has since gone viral, Cindie wrote: It takes the heat out of it fast and makes it more comfortable on you. First, buy some Menthol foam shaving cream. It has to be the foam and it has to have menthol in it. We found Gillette shaving cream on Amazon since we had problems finding menthol foam in stores. We ended up buying 6 cans of it, but it works out because we live in Texas and sunburns happen a lot. (Plus, we have given a couple cans to friends.) Next, apply the shaving cream on the burn. It may seem like it\u0027s a strange shaving ritual, but trust me! Don\u0027t rub it in, just let it sit on your skin. It will start bringing all that heat out (you\u0027ll be able to feel it). You may feel like you are itchy too, but that\u0027s a good thing! Itching means healing.  Cindie says after 30 minutes, the shaving cream should have dissolved into spots and feel dried out. You will feel as if you\u0027re becoming a little cold, she added. At least on the sunburned part of your body. THAT IS A GOOD SIGN! Next, rinse it off in a lukewarm or cool shower or bath. It\u0027s just to get the residue off. Finally, if you still need it, do it again the next day. Usually after that second treatment, the sunburn disappears. I use this on my kids too!  Cindie\u0027s mother-in-law learned the method from a doctor 40 years ago and thought it was crazy then too until she saw it in action. Stay-at-home mum Cindie has tried aloe vera in the past but finds the shaving cream works a lot better. She added: I\u0027m not saying to go out and do this, I was just showing my friends what I do. Please remember to always use sunscreen! Too much sun exposure can be dangerous and lead to cancer. By no means am I endorsing going out without sunscreen! I burn with sunscreen as well and know of the hassle, but it is worth it to wear it!

Look a little more closely, however, and you\u0027ll see there\u0027s something wrong with the photo of the Ballito Pro junior boy and girl champions this week. Yes, it\u0027s meant to be celebratory, but for the more eagle-eyed, the Billabong-sponsored surfing competition has also hit a seriously bum note. And it\u0027s all to do with the prizes.  In the image we see winners Rio Waida and Zo\u0026euml Steyn smiling.   Can you spot it?    Lucky old Rio gets to take home 8000 South African rand (\u0026pound442) for his surfing victory, while Zoe got awarded HALF OF THAT. Yep, don\u0027t be fooled by all the lip service being paid to addressing to gender inequality. It\u0027s still very much alive and well. It wasn\u0027t long before the photo sparked outrage.        Unfortunately, it seems this approach to prize money is pretty much an industry standard. So, if you win the World Surf League Championship Tour as a woman you’ll be rewarded with the equivalent of \u0026pound45k, which is a tidy sum.  If you happen to be a man however, you take home \u0026pound76.5k, Mamamia explains.

US forces are also assisting the operation as rescuers prepared to drill a shaft into the cave on the fifth day of the search. Major Buncha Duriyapan, commander of the 37th Military District in Chiang Rai, said workers would drill down from the top of the Tham Luang cave complex in northern Chiang Rai province to create an alternative entrance for rescue workers. We will drill down from one of the chimneys, Buncha told reporters on Thursday.  The expert divers went straight from the plane into the cave to make an assessment, he said, referring to the three British divers who landed in the country on Wednesday. Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said 30 members of the United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) have joined the search operation with equipment to help penetrate the cave walls.  Search efforts, which have included Thailand\u0027s elite navy SEAL unit, have been hampered by heavy rain and flooding inside the cave where the boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old assistant coach went missing on Saturday.  Rescue workers on Thursday scoured the top of the mountain looking for alternative entrances to the cave, according to a Reuters reporter at the scene. Thai National Deputy Police Chief Wirachai Songmetta said police officers would explore a one kms path to the right of the cave on Thursday.  So far, rescue teams have been focusing on a seven kilometre (four mile) long route to the left of the cave\u0027s entrance which they believe the boys and their coach took. Authorities say they\u0027re optimistic the boys are still alive, but the toll of five days of no news was visible on the faces of the boys\u0027 relatives.

Natalya Nemchinova has denied she previously worked as a porn actress despite X-rated videos and photos of her being uncovered.  And a man some claim is her husband - despite his denial of any romantic relationship with her - has told how she has “cried her eyes out” at the reports. Sergey Roschupkin, 46, said the claims in Moscow were “tearing her apart”. He echoed her denial this week that she had made adult movies, despite apparently clear evidence to the contrary, but admitted she had been involved in explicit photoshoots. Roschupkin also said two years ago she was Russian Playboy’s playmate of the year.  The owner of a chain of fitness clubs where Nemchinova also works said: “Yes, she did work as a model. “She took part in some rather explicit photo-sessions, but you do know the difference between nude and porn, don’t you? “Some (of) our people do not distinguish striptease and prostitution. “In 2016 Natasha (Natalya) became the girl of the year in Playboy and it is a great achievement for her. “We should be proud of such beautiful girls. “She was not looking for any scandalous popularity, she was just attending sports events. “But her beauty was seen as an eyesore, and the bloggers rushed to search for dirty linen. “Natasha is in great stress, she has cried out her eyes because of all she has faced recently. “And they keep tearing her apart.” Natalya also once featured naked in a video for Russian Maxim.  Roschupkin today denied being her husband or lover, but a top celebrity news source contradicted this and claimed the pair are deliberately masking their relationship. He told Komsomolskaya Pravda (KP) newspaper that she was “like a family member to me”. Roschupkin also spoke of his admiration for her after she was caught “in the middle” of the notorious Battle of Marseilles hooligan outrage two years ago. He said: “For six years, she has covered the whole (of) Europe, following our national football team. “And she had such a tough experience when two years ago in Marseilles fans ruined everything at the Euro championships. “She happened to be in the middle of this horror. Hundreds of fans were throwing bottles, breaking shop windows, the police were shocked. “And even after that, this tender girl did not stop going to games.  He added: “I have known Natasha for so many years, she is like a family member for me. “You can’t stop admiring her, she is a fantastic girl. “Some papers write that she is my wife, others – my lover. But all is wrong. “I am not commenting on this, why should I? “It has no affect on my private life, so it’s ok.” But celebrity blog Varvara Info claimed: “Natalya Nemchinova is known not only in Russia but abroad. “She became famous because of acting in adult films. “There are many photographs online where Natalya Nemchinova is pictured in explicit poses and now this girl is the face of World Cup 2018. Everyone knows she is a porno actress. “Bloggers have already investigated it and found out that most likely her husband is the one who is pushing her towards publicity. “The man in the pictures is Natalya Nemchinova’s husband, called Sergey Roschupkin. “He owns the chain of Zebra fitness centres. “They are always together but Nemchinova and Roschupkin are hiding the fact of their relationship, because otherwise the owner of the fitness clubs will be banned in the homes of celebrities.” "},{"url":null,"title":"saudi tv presenter investigated over","story":"NewsSaudi female TV presenter is investigated for indecency after wind blows her robe openShireen al-Rifaie was reporting on the end of Saudi Arabia\u0027s ban on women driving when her abaya blew open, revealing a white top and trousers underneath\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBySophie Evans09:08, 28 JUN 2018Updated09:16, 28 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Saudi TV presenter whose robe was blown open by the wind during a report is being investigated over her \u0027indecent\u0027 clothing.  Shireen al-Rifaie was reporting on the end of Saudi Arabia\u0027s ban on women driving when her abaya - a loose-fitting robe - blew open.  As she spoke to the camera, the item moved to the side, revealing her clothing underneath including a white top and trousers. Moments later, Shireen was filmed touching her \u0027loose\u0027 headscarf.  Now, the TV anchor is being investigated by Saudi officials - with some critics claiming she was \u0027naked\u0027 in the report, according to the BBC .   The hashtag “naked woman driving in Riyadh” has been used online, although many Saudis have mocked hardliners over their claims. Shireen was accused of \u0027indecent\u0027 clothing after she was filmed wearing the \u0027loose\u0027 headscarf and open gown in the middle of a street. The presenter, of the Dubai-based Al Aan TV, denies any wrongdoing and told the news site Ajel that she was wearing “decent clothes”. Earlier this week, the kingdom’s General Authority for Audiovisual Media said it had opened an investigation into a video. It said the footage appeared to show a TV presenter in clothing which was indecent, in violation of regulations and instructions.    According to Ajel, Shireen left the kingdom amid the outrage. Earlier this year, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that, in accordance with the laws, women must wear respectful attire. But he said they do not necessarily need to wear black head covers or abayas - with the decision entirely left for them to make.  He told CBS: The laws are very clear and stipulated in the laws of Sharia: that women wear decent, respectful clothing, like men.  He added: This, however, does not particularly specify a black abaya or black head cover. The decision is entirely left for women to decide what type of decent and respectful attire she chooses to wear.

Mihir Jain, 14, was addicted to fried food and his mum says he used to sit in bed all day eating. He lost the ability to walk properly and was house-bound, even having to drop out of school for a while. A doctor said he couldn\u0027t even open his eyes as he reached an extreme stage of obesity. Mihir\u0027s situation made him feel frustrated and angry, and his family decided something needed to change. He has now started to shed the pounds after having a gastric bypass in India, and he\u0027s thought to be one of the youngest people in the world to have had the procedure.  Mihir has already dropped to 27 stone (172kg), just two months after the operation at Max Hospital, in Delhi, northern India. The Marvel comics fan says he feels wonderful. He said: I used to get very angry and I was aggressive all the time, I had many problems. I couldn’t do normal every day things but I used to say to myself: don’t worry, you’ll do it some day. I used to tell myself to stay calm, you’ll get there some day. And I have reached that some day. Mihir weighed a normal 5lbs 5oz when he was born in November, 2003. But by the time he reached his fifth birthday he had already grown to a whopping 12 and a half stone (80kg). His mother, Puja Jain, 35, from Delhi, said: We first realised he had a problem when he was five and the doctor told us he was obese and needed surgery. But he was too young so he gave him some medicine. That medicine had side effects which meant he lost energy and he became weak on his legs. As the years passed he just used to sit in his bed all day, eating. So he just kept gaining and gaining more weight.  Even though Puja admits Mihir was always addicted to fried food she believes the medicine he was taking made him even more bed-bound than usual and consequently he gained even more weight. He dropped out of school and was home-tutored, while his younger sister Nandani, 13, carried on with life. Eventually Mihir lost touch with all his friends. His typical vegetarian high-carbohydrate diet was full fat milk, fried potato and vegetable cutlets, rice and vegetable curry, lots of potato, ice cream, milky coffee and fizzy drinks. Puja said: He was very angry sitting in one place all the time. Every child wants to go here and there and spend time with friends, he was sitting in one place all the time so he was very frustrated. It was hard for me watching other children playing outside and going to school and my child was not. I had one child going out and one not, it made me feel very sad and useless.  Eventually in 2013, Puja and her husband Rajesh, 37, went to see Dr Pradeep Chowbey at Max Hospital in Delhi, after her sister had successful bariatric surgery. I finally went to see the doctor in 2013 but Mihir was so big he couldn’t walk properly so I had to go without him, she recalled. The doctor said he needed to see him but we couldn’t get Mihir out of the house at the time. Finally, five years later, Mihir made it to see Dr Chowbey in December 2017. By that time he had reached an astounding 37 stone (237kg), with a height of 5ft 2ins (161cms), and suffered with diabetes, breathing issues and high blood pressure. The doctor assured Mihir he could help him but he had to lose a little bit of weight on his own first. Mihir was put on a high protein diet for three months and in April this year he had dropped to 197kg. He said: I was determined to do what the doctor suggested. And when I lost weight on my own it gave me the determination to keep going. I wasn’t even scared about surgery, I just wanted to do what was needed to get better.

She is a spirit medium full time.From her studio, Sacred Spirit in Carnoustie, she is able to give messages from those who have passed away to those who were closest to them.Karen has been able to connect to the spirit world her whole life but only began developing the skill about seven years ago.She said: “I really began my development seven years ago when I travelled down south to meet with Tony Stockwell.“He noticed straight away that I had the ability to be a great medium so he became my first teacher.“I then became a guest on the Scottish dates of his tour.“People think that you can either talk to the spirit or you can’t – and while not everyone has the ability to, if you can connect with the spirit world you need to develop your skills and gain understanding of what they are communicating to you.“For instance if a spirit shows me a sandcastle I know that means someone has been married in a castle. However, you need to work at it to be able to gain that understanding.”Whilst Karen appreciates there is now a greater understanding and interest in mediumship, there are people who see it as a “circus act”.Mediums are especially in the spotlight now as it is portrayed on a bigger platform with TV programmes dedicated to the skill.“There is such a big interest in this kind of work that it has become incredibly accessible with people even going live on social media, but I feel that takes away the personal aspect of it.“I try to give very personal details to people so they know I am telling the truth and I am reputable.“I have even been featured in magazines who have done “psychic under the spotlight” tests and gave me full marks for accuracy.“I feel incredibly lucky that I am able to do this job. I get really emotional but you can’t not get emotional!“I have ladies who sit opposite me in a state of grief and I feel anyone who comes to my events or for a one-to-one session is hurting or grieving and I am able to help those people. I am doing this to bring comfort to people and to help heal them and that is really important to me.“I wouldn’t change my ability at all, I love it.”As well as providing spiritual readings Karen also teaches mediumship to those who have the ability.She said: “I can instantly tell if someone is a medium or has the ability to be, I don’t know why, it’s just a connection.“I travel the world teaching mediums and also have regular students here in the studio. About 80% of those students are here because I have picked up that they have the ability.“I also do online teaching, so if anyone believes they could have the ability to reach the spirit world they should get in contact to develop their skill further.”Karen will be on stage at the Whitehall Theatre on Wednesday June 27.Tickets are priced at £16 and can be purchased from the box office.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2cf8557f688-848x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people student jim 73 gets third degree","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStudents of all ages packed out City Square as the Caird Hall hosted the  University of Dundee’s graduation ceremonies.Among those receiving a degree was 73-year-old Dundonian Jim Ashwood, who picked up his MA(Hons) in American History.Lifelong learner Jim was born on Small’s Wynd, which now forms part of the university campus itself.He said he was “absolutely chuffed” to be picking up his third degree.Hilltown mum Fiona Dixon, 47, is one of the university’s first part-time students to graduate with honours after collecting her First Class MA in English and History.Fiona said: “It’s been a brilliant experience.

armstrong cash boost from celtic transfer to southampton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United won’t get their Stuart Armstrong windfall straight away but that will not affect their summer signing programme.The Tangerines are in line to receive six figures from Celtic when Armstrong completes an expected £6 million switch to English Premier League outfit Southampton this week.It’s because of a sell-on clause from the deal when the Scottish international left Tannadice for Parkhead back at the end of January 2015.Once the £1m plus the Hoops paid for him then is deducted, the cash heading to Tannadice is likely to be between £400,000 and half a million.While that will be more than welcome as United prepare for another money-losing season in the Championship, with the player’s likely move to England coming out of the blue, it is not something they budgeted for.That means the further signings being planned will not be hit by the fact Celtic do not have to pay up straight away and, if they choose, could stagger the payments over two or three years.What the money could become is a nice extra for manager Csaba Laszlo if he makes moves in the transfer market during the January window.Right now he is looking to put the finishing touches to rebuilding a squad that’s already seen eight new first-team players fixed up.He remains in the market for another striker and a central defender, in particular.Potential target Callum Morris completed a moved to second-tier rivals Ross County at the weekend – along with former Tannadice team-mate Keith Watson.Morris was still on a list of possible signings but after securing stopper Frederic Frans earlier this month, a footballing defender is being sought.Former striker David Goodwillie could complete a move from Clyde to Premiership new boys Livingston this week if the clubs can agree a fee.United were aware of his likely availability during the close season but, given his off-field issues, there was no chance of him being handed a third spell at Tannadice.Monday saw the players start their first full week of pre-season training at their St Andrews base.They are due to see action for the first time tomorrow week in a friendly at Brechin and more games are set to be pencilled in.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.126288.jpg ","title":"dundee united to get six figure sum as stuart armstrong completes move from celtic to southampton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are now guaranteed a six-figure windfall after former star Stuart Armstrong signed for Southampton.The Scotland midfielder has penned a four-year deal after completing his £7 million switch from Celtic.Under the terms of his 2015 moved from Tannadice to Parkhead, the Tangerines are due a chunk of that fee.That’s likely to see them land somewhere between £400,000 and £500,00, though the details of over what period that money comes in will have to be thrashed out with the Hoops.Armstrong’s future at Celtic Park had been in doubt after negotiations over a new contract had stalled, leaving Brendan Rodgers to cash in with just a year to run on his current deal.He was part of the side that won the ‘double treble’ under Rodgers and won a total of eight major trophies during his time at the club.He scored 17 times in 2016-17 and forced his way into the Scotland setup but struggled to replicate that form last season after an injury.Armstrong is manager Mark Hughes’ first signing of the summer window after Southampton narrowly survived relegation from the top flight of English football, and the former Stoke boss was keen to add the Scot’s creativity to a squad that scored just 37 goals last season.Hughes said: “Stuart is a player who we have admired for some time, and I am delighted we have been able to bring him here, especially given the competition we faced to sign him.“We have strong players in the squad and it is important we build on that by adding different qualities.“It is important we add a greater goal threat to the team as a whole, and to our midfield specifically, and Stuart’s record of scoring and creating makes him an extremely exciting addition in that area.“He brings with him extensive experience of European football and has developed his game impressively over the past few seasons at a major club in Celtic, where there is a demand not only to perform but also to win. Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals. I hope going forwards from here that it will be the same this term at St Mary’s.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32069b78095-490x564.jpg ","title":"football is a labour of love for refreshed dundee united coach craig easton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAnyone who’s come across him down the years will testify enthusiasm has never been an issue with new Dundee United reserve team manager Craig Easton.As far back as when he was part of the youth system he’s now spearheading, Craig’s huge appetite for the game was always apparent.Even he, though, admits a spell out of the game a couple of years back was a perfect reminder of just how good life in football is.It came when financial problems at Torquay United forced him into an unexpected move back to Scotland and left him searching for work.Not content to sit around waiting for his next job, Eastie ended up working in the building trade and admits it was one of the best moves he’s ever made.“I was in England for 12 years and I didn’t even think of coming back up to Scotland to be honest,” he said.“But in football you can’t plan what’s going to happen, especially as a player and then, when I was coaching, I found things could change as well.“I was with Torquay working with the U/19s and college kids. It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man denies embezzling 2800 from local barbers shop while employed there","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man has been accused of embezzling almost £3,000 from a barber’s shop.William Hill, 37, of Greenholme Avenue in Morecambe, denies that he embezzled £2,800 at McKellan Barbers in High Street, Newport-on-Tay, while in employment there between February 25 and June 9 last year.His trial was fixed for September 20 with an intermediate diet on August 30.Hill admitted failing to appear at a court hearing on May 31 and sentence on that matter was deferred until August 30.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b222ed15f5ad-847x564.jpg ","title":"more summer signings to come promises dundee gaffer mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann is delighted with the five summer signings he’s made so far and the Dundee boss is determined more will follow.Monday saw Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy fixed up on a two-year deal from Belgians Lokeren to join fellow-new boys Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph, Kharl Madianga and Elton Ngwatala in pre-season training.Neil felt it was import to get the bulk of his transfer business done as early as possible but his aim is to make more moves before the window slams shut at the end of August.“I hope to get one or two more in and we’ve always got targets,” said Neil.“This year we are a bit more advanced than we were this time last year and that’s good because I wanted to get a bit of business done immediately.“Now you go for ones who can probably be a wee bit more troublesome to get in but we are working hard on that and as the pre-season goes on maybe we’ll get a bit more business done.”To that end the gaffer has identified specific players and areas of the team where he wants to add more depth but will be giving nothing away on that until contracts have been signed.“I wouldn’t go into specific areas. There’s definitely specific targets on that and we are working hard on that but we won’t be giving anything away.”Missing from pre-season so far have been Craig Wighton and Glen Kamara both of whom were on international duty after their seasons with Dundee ended.Centre-half Steven Caulker has also been absent because of charity work he was committed to before joining up at Dens early this year but all three will report back today.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32068acec06-839x564.jpg ","title":"new boy mendy almost signed by dundee in january","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has revealed he was close to signing new Dundee arrival Jean Alassane Mendy back in January.He held talks with the Senegalese striker back then but was pipped for his signature by Belgians Lokeren.Things did not work out for Mendy there and now Neil is delighted to have been able to get a player he believes can score regularly in the top flight.He said: \u0026#8220We tried to get him in January and I think we missed out by just a couple of hours.

I said ‘if you can do it, sign’.“It’s a really good club – even if it’s the rival of my team! I’d prefer if he signed for Dundee but it’s still a good club.“United have got a good goalkeeper in him. He’s massive, really tall and his English is perfect so that won’t be a problem.“He’s good on the ball and can pass well. Even under pressure you can pass him the ball and he can deal with it, he’s calm and experienced. He’s dominant in the box, too, and comes for crosses.“At Vaduz there were two goalkeepers and they switched all the time but I really enjoyed playing when Benjamin was in goal.”Konrad is considering offers from Holland and Germany but says he’d be happy to return to Scotland.“I would go back to Scotland, I really enjoyed my two years there, though I’ve not had any options there. If there was a good offer I would go back.“A year ago at Vaduz we were relegated and weren’t able to go back up last campaign.“We had a poor start to the season with basically a new team. You could compare it to Dundee United’s season in the Championship. There was one team that had a good start and just kept winning.“It was nice in Vaduz, a good place to play. I can’t compare it to Scotland, though.“The fans in Dundee were mad for football and the stadiums were great. I don’t know if the fans in Vaduz and Switzerland don’t like football much but it isn’t the No 1 sport and it was really calm in the stadiums.”That’s something he couldn’t say about derby days in Dundee – some of his best memories of his time at Dens Park.“I had the two best years of my career at Dundee.“The derby win after 10 or 11 years and beating them at home was great.“The first game at Celtic Park was also a good memory. It is a really famous stadium, even in Germany.“All the derby wins were really good experiences and I feel really proud to have been a part of those games.“I like the rivalry in Dundee. It’s not a nasty rivalry compared with some places in Germany, there’s no fighting, but a lot of banter and people have a bit of a laugh about it.“I still keep an eye on Dundee. Unfortunately there are not many players left from when I was there.“Maybe Gowser, Cammy and Craig Wighton. I still speak to Scott Bain and Nick Ross, too.”It was a mixed experience for Konrad working under manager Paul Hartley at Dens Park, however.“Paul Hartley was hard but fair, I would say.“He had his players, his top players who he would speak to all the time.“He wasn’t always easy, sometimes he would shout at me and Luka Tankulic for no reason but it was football, you live with that.\u0026#8220He played me 69 times in two years so I can’t complain.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cheeky-punter-caught-trying-to-get-served-at-beer-festival-using-little-britain-driving-licence","story":"                          A CHEEKY punter was caught trying to use this fake driving licence featuring the face of Little Britain\u0027s Andy Pipkin to get served booze at a beer festival."},{"url":null,"title":"astonishing-moment-six-year-old-produces-inch-perfect-strike-in-top-bin","story":"                          THIS is the astonishing moment a six-year-old produces an inch-perfect wonder strike while brushing up on her shooting skills in her back garden at home."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7883429.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"adorable-moment-young-boy-realises-animals-go-into-meat-and-turns-vegetarian","story":"                          THIS adorable video shows the moment a five-year-old boy realises that animals are turned into meat -

ARGH\u0027s request the Autistic Pride Day flag was flown at the Scottish Government HQ, St Andrews House in Edinburgh,\" she said.Mrs Brook believes that it is a day of celebration and a chance for autistic people to show they are proud of who they are.She added: \"It\u0027s also a show of defiance to those who would rather we were ashamed, quiet, or forgotten.\"The group were supported by Tesco who provided craft materials, Ashers bakery who provided a celebration cake and Strathspey Railway who donated a family ticket for the quiz prize.Special speakers provided stories about life with

we are valid, we aren\u0027t ashamed.\"A NEW deal for people with autism in the Highlands \u0026ndash placing them at the heart of discussions about their care \u0026ndash is being proposed by a newly appointed champion.After months of stinging criticism over its treatment of people with autism NHS Highland has appointed occupational therapist Arlene Johnstone to be its first head of service for learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s

similar conditions impact people\u0027s ability to perform everyday tasks due to uncontrollable shaking.Sufferers treated at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London have experienced substantial improvement after access to the equipment, according to senior surgeons.The machine enables ultrasound waves to pass through the skull to the part of the brain responsible for the tremor.Due to the incision-less

launched on Thursday.Attended by charity representatives and local councillors, the call was made to make the Highland capital fit for the 21st century.The manifesto has been produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"As \u0026lsquoThe Gateway to the Highlands\u0026rsquo Inverness plays a pivotal role in promoting the region as an attractive place to live, work and visit.\"But a vital element for any successful 21st century Scottish city must be inclusivity \u0026ndash a city that is open and welcoming to everyone \u0026ndash and the key to inclusivity is physical accessibility.\"She added: \"A Street Charter would help to avoid entrenching flawed designs that could blemish Inverness for a generation or more.\"Brian MacKenzie of the Highland Cycle Campaign said\u0026nbsp the drive to get things right first time made good financial sense for cash-strapped local authorities.\"For example, a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings they have themselves removed\u0026rsquo,\" he said.The manifesto states: \"A Street Charter would offer planners and consultants a template for inclusive design, potentially saving the council money by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city

event in July last year.However, after a man died in an accident at the race track last August, restrictions were put in place which led to the annual event being reworked into the newly named “AutoFest,” which included a trade show, themed displays and demonstrations.It was originally planned for Sunday from 10am until 5pm, however organisers have now taken the decision to cancel the event.Curator Mike Ward said: “Last year SpeedFest broke all records and it was totally safe, but we couldn’t have the speed element this year as the track is part of the investigation at the moment, and if there was any incident it would be unforgiveable.“There wasn’t any appetite for it without the speed element.”It was decided to cancel the event, so that an activity that was substandard to the reputation of the museum’s event schedule was not held.Despite the cancellation, the museum will be holding a range of other events across the rest of the summer which are expected to draw big crowds.The highlight, Mike said, is going to be Grampian Motorbike Convention, which although won’t include the same speed aspect as before, will bring back the delegated machines being allowed to drive straight into the event – a format that was used previously and will excite veteran convention attendees.Other notable events include Big Stuff Rides on July 19, which involves large commercial

to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland. The last time I crossed Scotland for the appeal I was swimming and running, so cycling has to be easier… right?\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who gets involved and I look forward to riding with you.\u0026#8217Mari Slavin of the STV Children’s Appeal said: \u0026#8216Mark is a fantastic ambassador for the Appeal and we are all in awe of the gigantic challenge he’s about to take on, together with cyclists from across the country. STV’s cameras will be there – and trying hard to keep up! – to capture the highs and lows of this incredible marathon venture\u0026#8217After a 4am start in Argyll, Mark’s 240-mile cycle route will pass through Tarbert, Ardrishaig, Lochgilphead, Inveraray, Tyndrum, Crainlarich, Killin, Aberfeldy, Pitlochry, Glenshee, Braemar, Ballater and Peterculter \u0026#8211 among many other towns and villages \u0026#8211 before finishing in Aberdeen.If you think you’re up for this epic feat of endurance, get in touch with Mark on aroundtheworld@thehunterfoundationA corporate offer is also available with four-person relay teams invited to enter for a minimum donation of £5,000.Can’t face the cycle but still want to be involved?

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mainstreet-marks-a-decade-in-the-borders-with-makars-and-cake","story":"IF one Borders business deserves a celebration to mark a decade of business it\u0027s Mainstreet Trading.\nThe St Boswells bookshop and cafe opened at the height of the recession in June, 2008.\nAnd the pet project of Bill and Rosamund de la Hey also faced the sudden growth of ebooks as well as the emergence of online retailer Amazon.\nBut the couple, who had forged successful careers within the publishing industry in London, didn\u0027t just survive - they thrived.\nOver the past 10 years Mainstreet Trading has scooped several national awards, including both the UK Independent Bookseller of the Year and the Scottish Borders Independent Retailer of the Year.\nSix years ago there was even an expansion with the opening of Mainstreet Deli and Home in neighbouring buildings.\nAnd now the successful enterprise employs a total of 26 people.\nAhead of this Saturday\u0027s 10th birthday party, Mainstreet has launched a year-long campaign of selecting a favourite book from each of the past 10 years, producing a range of 10th birthday illustrated merchandise, and also running a Summer Reading Diary competition, giving local children the chance to win their height in books.\nRosamund and Bill have also announced that celebrated authors Sir Michael Morpurgo and Maggie O\u0026rsquoFarrell have been appointed as Mainstreet Makars to represent the children\u0026rsquos and adult book world, respectively.\nMichael is delighted with his appointment.

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"united-front-to-boost-the-borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716321574,16320757,16320674,16320502,16320330\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

made for good scoring conditions and the leading contenders did not disappoint.In the third round, Greg Watson and his father, Duncan Watson III, opened their account, both covering the front nine in 32 shots, two clear of George MacMillan but it was the inward nine which proved the turning point.Greg was in superb form, coming back in an unprecedented 27 shots which included an eagle at the 18th where he chipped in from 30 yards to make him the first player to have a sub 60 round since George MacMillan set the record of 58 in 2001.George came back in 32 to post an excellent 66.Meanwhile, Donald McNeil clinched the senior championship with a 75 to give him a three-round total of 210.Greg and Donald led the handicap section at this point with both on 192, ahead of Lee Mathieson on 195.Going into the final round, Greg led by 11 shots from George MacMillan but a 62 by Greg put the result beyond doubt and made him champion.George finished runner-up with Lee Mathieson taking third

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.

Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.

The group decided to make it an unofficial world record attempt because they were worried they would have to turn away people who were not dancing in time to the music. Instead, they can now welcome all-comers, with an instructional video already on the group\u0026rsquos Facebook page to get revellers in the mood."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7929938.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"north-berwick-high-school-students-taking-play-to-the-highlands","story":"              MEMBERS of the Indelible Arts Youth Theatre are heading to the Highlands for the final of a national competition this weekend.  They are one of four one-act plays that will take part in the Scottish Community Drama\u0026rsquos National Youth Drama final in Plockton on Saturday.  The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment. In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"calls-to-tackle-edinburgh-bypass-gridlock-as-tram-system-to-musselburgh-mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.

An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.  The other is an archer planned for the banks of the River Esk, with its installation expected to be next week. A trail of arrows around the town is also planned and will link in with a Global Treasure App, a treasure trail organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-first-reverse-vending-machine-is-at-musselburgh-iceland","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS Iceland store has become the first supermarket in Scotland to introduce a reverse vending machine in a bid to end plastic pollution.  These machines reward people for recycling by providing money or vouchers in return for empty containers.  Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.  The six-month trials are designed to help the company better understand consumer perceptions and appetite for plastics-recycling technology across the UK.  They come ahead of the expected launch of a national deposit return scheme to which the Scottish, UK and Welsh Governments have all announced their commitment in principle.  The trials will help Iceland to provide government and industry with insights that might support the creation of a national scheme.  Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis reverse vending machine will provide valuable evidence on how to help reduce single-use plastic waste and encourage customers to change their own behaviour as we look to end Scotland\u0026rsquos throwaway culture.  \u0026ldquoI would urge all manufactures and retailers to follow Iceland\u0026rsquos example and consider what action they can take to reduce the use of single-use plastics.  \u0026ldquoIn the coming months the Scottish Government will be consulting on a new deposit return scheme for drinks containers that will be one step to increase recycling rates right across Scotland.  \u0026ldquoAs part of our action to reduce the blight of waste littering our communities and polluting our seas we are also consulting on proposals to ban the manufacture and sale of plastic-stemmed cotton buds and have appointed an expert panel to consider what further steps can be taken on items like plastic straws and disposable cups."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959630.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"future-of-the-hollies-day-centre-safeguarded","story":"              THE future of the Hollies Day Centre at its present location in Musselburgh has been safeguarded.  It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

While we produce CO2 when we exhale, the gas used in the food processing and drinks industries is produced as a by-product of the fertiliser industry.  It puts the fizz in beer, cider and soft drinks, helps prolong the shelf life of meat and is seen by some as the most humane way to stun animals before slaughter.  But there is a shortage as a number of European fertiliser plans closed down for routine maintenance while only two of five UK plans are operating and this is having its effect in the food and drink industry.    Ei Group, Britain\u0027s biggest pub group that formerly traded as Enterprise Inns says some outlets are running out of certain beer brands.  And the Glasgow Science Centre has had to cancel its summer show because they cannot get dry ice.  Roger White, chief executive of Irn-Bru maker AG Barr said they were \"very concerned about the supply challenges\" while it had invested in additional CO2 storage last year.    \"That having been said, we are working to maintain and maximise our supply, and as we speak we are taking the steps to ensure we have all the products in the right place,\" said Mr Barr, whose company also produces Strathmore spring water, Rockstar energy drinks and its own brand lemonade, limeade, cherryade and cream soda.  Pig processing plant to suspend production amid CO2 shortage  \"Obviously if the difficulties were to become more acute, or circumstances change it would have a significant affect on our ability to produce. But at the minute with a lot of hard work we are getting through okay and we don\u0027t have any availability issues for customers.\"  Heineken said its CO2 supplier is \u0026ldquofacing a major issue with supply availability in the UK.  \u0026ldquoLike many other businesses in the food and drinks industry, we are affected by this shortage, said the Amstel, Foster\u0026rsquos and Strongbow parent company .    C\u0026ampC Group, owner of Tennent\u0026rsquos and Magners, said the company has reassured its customers that availability of its brands is \u0026ldquocurrently unaffected.  The food wholesaler Booker said it was limiting sales of some lines to 10 cases per customer per day to prevent \u0026ldquosub-wholesaling.  The Tesco-owned retailer, which is used by bars, restaurants and traders, said the move was to preserve availability and satisfied the \u0026ldquovast majority of Booker customers.  Tesco said the CO2 shortage had not resulted in any availability issues on any product lines.  However, Booker\u0026rsquos move follows Scotland\u0026rsquos largest pig processing plant, Quality Pork in Brechin, Angus, suspending its slaughtering process. It carried out its last slaughter on Tuesday due to a lack of the gas used to stun animals before they are killed.    Pete Cheema, chief executive of the Scottish Grocers\u0026rsquo Federation said they were \"concerned\" to hear about the impact of the shortage but that despite that they hoped manufacturers \"will be fair\" with the distribution of any remaining stocks of products such beers, ciders and soft drinks.  The British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) said the shortage of CO2 across northern Europe is \u0026ldquoimpacting a wide range of businesses across the food and drink sector.  \u0026ldquoSoft drinks producers in the UK are taking active steps to maintain their service to customers including working with their suppliers to mitigate the impact as well as looking at alternative sources, said BSDA director general Gavin Partington.  The National Farmers\u0027 Union Scotland last week said six days ago that the CO2 issue was not something that had been raised by poultry members.  Now NFUS has called for CO2 supplies to be redirected to abbatoirs to avoid animal welfare issues.  NFUS\u0026rsquos pigs and poultry, and animal health and welfare policy manager Penny Middleton said: \u0026ldquoThe shortage of CO2 is having a critical impact on the slaughter of pigs and poultry, where gas stunning is the preferred method of slaughter for welfare reasons.  \u0026ldquoThe processing plant at Brechin has already announced that it will not be able to take any more pigs from today, a decision that will impact heavily on pig units reliant on being able to get pigs away.  \u0026ldquoAny disruption to that flow can result in welfare issues and overcrowding.  \u0026ldquoGiven the expectation of animal welfare problems on pig and poultry units NFUS feels that it is vital that CO2 supplies are reserved and directed to those plants in need.  According to the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) the hot weather is exacerbating the issue and could have a \u0026ldquopotentially huge effect on British food production.  \u0026ldquoThings are getting pretty tight and this hot weather won\u0026rsquot be helping, BMPA\u0026rsquos chief executive Nick Allen said.  The British Retail Consortium (BRC) added: \u0026ldquoWe are aware of specific pressures in some areas such as carbonated soft drinks, beer, British chicken and British pork but the majority of food products are unaffected and retailers do not anticipate food shortages.  \u0026ldquoHowever, it is likely that the mix of products available may be affected."},{"url":null,"title":"angela-haggerty-time-running-out-for-sturgeon-to-pass-her-big-education-test","story":"              THE Cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday provided a good day to bury bad news for Education Secretary John Swinney as he confirmed that the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos flagship Education Bill was to be shelved.  It would be a mistake to underestimate quite how serious this is: not only is education one of the Government\u0026rsquos biggest weak spots, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon even publicly requested that her time and record in office be judged on it. When she appointed a political big hitter like Swinney to the post of Education Secretary two years ago, it was a statement of intent. As recently as September last year, Sturgeon was still promising new legislation on education when she outlined her programme for government.  Problems in Scottish education have been thoroughly and robustly debated in recent years. The attainment gap, which is the gulf in performance between pupils from richer and poorer backgrounds, has been well documented. The end of 2016 provided a notable low point, however, when international figures revealed that Scotland\u0026rsquos standards in maths, reading and science were classed as average, which represented further decline. It was disastrous news for the Scottish Government, and demoralising for the nation. It felt like something of a rock bottom it was painful to have confirmation of such a falling performance, and it intensified fears about the future of Scotland\u0026rsquos children.  However, much of the Government\u0026rsquos proposed solutions in recent years for improving matters have been met with dismay. Take standardised testing, for instance. The measure was introduced last year in an effort to assess pupil performance in numeracy and literacy, and mostly tests primary school children. However, critics fear that it could cause undue pressure on pupils and introduce a mood of short-term competition between schools rather than a focus on long term development, despite promises from Swinney that school-by-school data would not be published.  A key part of the currently ditched Education Bill was to give far more power to headteachers over teacher recruitment and budgets instead of local authorities. Again, the Government was met with a barrage of concerns. Teaching union the EIS called for a period of \u0026ldquostability and consolidation and more support for teachers and schools following the introduction of the Curriculum for Excellence in 2010. The programme was developed after a consultation in 2002, and new qualifications were later introduced to work more comfortably alongside it. This was a big change to the delivery of education, and the prospect of further dramatic changes after such a short time, at a point where schools are already under substantial pressure, was met with grave warnings by many in the sector.  But the Government wasn\u0026rsquot entirely without support. The Scottish Conservatives became the only party willing to get on board with it in principle \u0026ndash the prospect of transferring control from local government directly to schools is more ideologically in tune with the Tories\u0026rsquo way of thinking \u0026ndash which was never a comfortable position for the SNP. When the SNP is battering the Tories at Westminster at every opportunity, it was always going to be politically problematic to rely on the party in Scotland to get through its flagship education reforms. If Sturgeon\u0026rsquos legacy is resting on education, it\u0026rsquos unlikely she\u0026rsquod be keen on thanking the Tories for helping to shape it.  And so here we are. Swinney hopes the public will believe that the Government doesn\u0026rsquot really need the legislation anymore because he\u0026rsquos had a word with local authorities and they\u0026rsquove decided between them that they can just \u0026ldquofast track a number of changes without the need for all that parliamentary time wasting. That\u0026rsquos only credible if he really expects people to believe that Sturgeon installed one of her top people in one of the most important roles of her Government only in order to have a word with local councils.  What it really means is that the Government, at least to some extent, is going back to the drawing board. While this is politically humiliating, it will be met with a sigh of relief from campaigners and others opposed to the approach, who will now hope that the Scottish Government has a radical rethink about how to fix its education nightmare.  But it\u0026rsquos halfway through 2018 and the Scottish Parliament goes into recess this week. Time is running out for the SNP to demonstrate enough visible progress in education before the next Scottish elections, and make no mistake: if Nicola Sturgeon wants to be judged on education, her opponents at the ballot box will be relentless in attacking her over a failure to deliver results.  So it was interesting, this week, to see Sturgeon make such sweeping changes to her Cabinet while Swinney tried to quietly retire one of the biggest legislative priorities of the Government. It\u0026rsquos not only in education that Sturgeon\u0026rsquos Government has problems the now former health secretary Shona Robison, for example, had been tipped for some time to be on the way out following criticisms of NHS performance. She\u0026rsquoll be replaced by Jeane Freeman, a rising star of the party who was previously trusted with the social security brief despite only being elected in 2016. Indeed, it was a good day for rising stars, including big names like Humza Yousaf, who found themselves promoted.  Sturgeon may be hoping that a shake up of the Cabinet will play well for the party as it gears up for Brexit and the next Scottish elections in 2021, although it did come as a surprise to see the newly elected deputy leader of the party, Keith Brown, leave his post as Economy Secretary \u0026ndash it seems peculiar, despite the official line that he needs to focus his efforts on party business.  Swinney, however, remains in his brief. To move him out of education, effectively admitting a massive failure, would have been unthinkable. It would have been humiliating for the Government, and it would have caused real damage to Sturgeon\u0026rsquos leadership.  The SNP hierarchy may be hoping they get away with their big education climb down, but it\u0026rsquos an open goal for the opposition unless the Government can pull something amazing out of the bag in a short time. If not, Sturgeon\u0026rsquos 2015 plea to be judged on education may severely haunt her at the ballot box. Be careful what you wish for."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-as-melvyn-bragg-suggests-if-were-not-clever-were-going-to-end-up-stupid","story":"              WE have become a nation of airheads. Round up any cross section of our younger population and you\u0026rsquoll discover an IQ just a little higher than that of a council wheely bin. Who says so? Well, Melvyn Bragg, (not in so many words) in declaring Britain to be \u0026ldquoa stupid country.  Now, should we believe the Radio 4 presenter simply because he can leap from talking about the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire one minute to the understanding of the proton in a heartbeat? You bet. Because Bragg isn\u0026rsquot bragging from the vantage point of a higher intellect. He\u0026rsquos summing up the growing fear of a growing nation of non-thinkers.  The evidence is in our faces and Facebook pages. We used to ridicule the Santa Ponsa restaurants which put pictures of food in their windows. Now we live in a world of posing, pouting young people who take pictures of their dinner.  We live in a world where 25 per cent of young Scots are classed as \"extreme users of social media,\" which the Government\u0027s Information Commissioner is now investigating.  Meanwhile, video games are shrinking their brains. A new study by the University of California reveals the impulsive part of the brain (the amygdala-striatal system) which video games rely upon, is not only more sensitive but also smaller in excessive users.  Koko the gorilla died last week in California, and decades-long studies revealed he had an IQ of around 90, which is close to some humans. But it\u0026rsquos not surprising the primates are catching up when you learn one-in-five young Scots wake up during the night to check their phone.  One study by British scientists found IQs have started to fall by seven points per generation after having risen every decade since the Second World War. And technology is one of the reasons why.  Clever people are continually coming up with ways to make the rest of us dafter. The more we ask Alexis and co to play us a song, the less we have to think.  Smart gadgets mean we don\u0026rsquot need to switch on the light, or use a map to find our way around. We can ask Google almost anything. We love Twitter because it\u0026rsquos brief and we even text less now. We send emojis. Pretty soon we\u0026rsquoll go back to communicating in sign language. But by that time, the apes will be using our iPads.  Soon we won\u0026rsquot need to think to drive cars. We have Fitbits to tell us how many steps we need to take to lose weight, but the truth is all we have to do is look in the mirror. (Here\u0026rsquos a general rule of thumb if you have breasts, and you\u0026rsquore a man, pull on the trainers and T-shirt.)  Writer/historian/former editor of the New Internationalist, Graham Hancock has long argued we have devolved over the years, given less need to think on our feet. Where man once built perfectly measured pyramids with keen eye and sharp imagination, we can\u0026rsquot get the same results today even with a theodolite.  Devolution seems to be evidenced in our TV output and while Melvyn Bragg points out there has been some great TV this year, including Patrick Melrose (Sky) and A Very English Scandal (BBC1). (And he\u0026rsquos correct populist entertainment can also be very clever. ) But he points out little else matches up. The correlation of this is the recognition of the inane predictability of drama such as Dr Foster or recent divorce series The Split. (Both insulting to women.)  Lord Bragg does say he\u0026rsquos yet to watch Love Island but when he does view this Bikini and Budgie Smugglers Show it will indeed highlight the vacuity of the format and those who take part. Yes, it\u0026rsquos can be fun, and when one young lady said she didn\u0026rsquot know what Brexit actually meant, that was understandable given Theresa May doesn\u0026rsquot either. But what\u0026rsquos tragic is the most popular programme in the country right now mostly features the hard of thinking. And watching the show suggests we\u0026rsquore becoming as dim-witted as them.  There\u0026rsquos also an argument we\u0026rsquore producing more clever young people given the huge rise in Firsts handed out by universities this year. But as Herald writer Rosemary Goring pointed out this is a deliberate strategy by universities to manipulate results to make their courses more attractive.  The reality is Bragg is right. For \u0026ldquostupid you can also read \u0026ldquofrivolous or \u0026ldquofatuous. That\u0026rsquos why we need to encourage learning. We need to encourage discussion, and not by text or Snapchat. School children need to be given books, taken to films that may make them think and encouraged to read newspapers. We need to switch on our own lights.

He has proved inspirational for all those who have worked alongside him and provides an exemplary model for those Glasgow graduates who will follow after him.  \u0026ldquoDrawing from the Scripture that has shaped him and in the language that he loves, let me finish with an exhortation befitting Angus Morrison and his life of service. \u0026lsquoIs math a rinn thu, a sheirbheisich mhaith is dh\u0026igraveleis.\u0026rsquo (Mata 25:21) [Well done, good and faithful servant!]"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-says-uk-and-eu27-keen-to-worker-at-faster-pace-to-secure-brexit-deal","story":"              THERESA May has said Britain and the European Union are both keen to make \"faster\" progress on Brexit negotiations as she arrived in Brussels for a meeting with leaders from across the bloc.

Scottish Canals recently announced it might not be able to keep its network open to traffic because of a lack of cash, leading to fears of canals becoming \u0026ldquostagnant ditches.

She suggested this was a \u0026ldquoperfect illustration of Global Britain, clinching a lucrative deal as the country embarked on life beyond the European Union.  BAE Systems has been chosen as the preferred bidder for the SEA 5000 Future Frigate, beating off competition from Italy and Spain.  The UK company will build nine warships in Adelaide with a design based on Britain\u0026rsquos Type 26 Global Combat Ship the first export of a British design for new-build frigates since the 1970s.  No 10 explained the agreement would secure more than 4000 jobs in Australia and also boost Britain\u0026rsquos export economy for generations to come.  In turn, it said it was hoped that the contract would also benefit the UK economy with exports having the potential to drive regional growth, create new jobs and showcase the strength of British innovation on the world stage.  The multi-billion pound deal is the result of four years of intensive Government engagement involving a number of departments across Whitehall.  The Prime Minister has been directly involved in making the case for the UK bid, including in bilateral talks with her Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull at Chequers earlier this year.  Over the past 18 months Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, and Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, have all visited Australia to extol the benefits of Britain\u0026rsquos world-class design, engineering and innovation.  \u0026ldquoThe sheer scale and nature of this contract puts the UK at the very forefront of maritime design and engineering and demonstrates what can be achieved by UK industry and Government working hand-in-hand, declared Mrs May.  \u0026ldquoWe have always been clear that as we leave the EU we have an opportunity to build on our close relationships with allies like Australia. This deal is a perfect illustration that the Government is doing exactly that.  \u0026ldquoAnd while this is an enormous boost for the UK economy, it will also cement our strategic partnership with one of our oldest and closest friends for decades to come, she added.  Dr Fox pointed out how the UK and Australia already enjoyed a strong trading relationship worth more than \u0026pound13 billion a year.  \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos announcement is a further boost to this relationship, which will create significant opportunities for companies in both countries to deepen their trading ties.  These opportunities, the International Trade Secretary explained, included increased data and information sharing, high-end technology transfer, and collaboration at the cutting-edge of maritime expertise.  Downing Street also pointed out how the new contract would build on the century-long ties between the two nations and would allow \u0026ldquointeroperability between Australian and Royal Navy ships amid a climate of intensifying threats around the world, especially in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific regions.  The 6,900 tonne multi-mission warships are designed to support anti-submarine warfare and a whole range of other operations anywhere in the world. They will form a key part of Australia\u0026rsquos hugely respected Navy.  The contract was secured with the UK committed to getting eight of the Type 26 warfare frigates, which are currently in-build on the River Clyde and are set to enter service with the Royal Navy in the 2020s.  Charles Woodburn for BAE Systems added: \u0026ldquoI am proud that our world class anti-submarine warfare design and our approach to transferring technology and skills to the nations in which we work is expected to contribute to the development of an enduring world-class naval shipbuilding industry in Australia."},{"url":null,"title":"eu27-piles-pressure-on-theresa-may-to-come-up-with-clear-brexit-plan","story":"              PRESSURE is piling on Theresa May to produce a clear Brexit plan as Ireland\u0026rsquos Leo Varadkar suggested Britain should have come up with one two years ago \u0026ndash before the EU referendum.

We have laws and rules and principles and they can\u0027t be changed for any one country, even a great country like Britain.  \"Any relationship that exists in the future between the EU and the UK isn\u0027t going to be one of absolute equals: we\u0027re 27 member states, the UK is one country, we\u0027re 500 million people, the UK is 60 million.

Donald Tusk, the European Council President, in a letter to EU leaders ahead of the summit, proposed the creation of \"regional disembarkation platforms\" outside the bloc where migrants could be processed, separating refugees from economic migrants.  He warned: \"There are voices in Europe and around the world claiming that our inefficiency in maintaining the external border is an inherent feature of the European Union, or - more broadly - of liberal democracy.\"  Before leaders gathered in Brussels, the embattled German Chancellor Angela Merkel starkly warned migration \u0026ldquocould determine the fate of the European Union\" some observers suggested it was more likely to determine her own fate as leader of her country.  *The Commons Brexit Committee has recommended MPs should spend at least five days debating the final Brexit deal, saying how it would be \"the most significant parliamentary debate in a generation\"."},{"url":null,"title":"business success for kintore couple","story":"\t\t\t\tDonna and Jason Orton, who have been helped by Business Gateway Aberdeen City \u0026amp Shire, opened the doors to their unique business in Abercrombie Court, Westhill, just over a year ago.

In particular, the Brick by Brick initiative, which has been a fantastic platform to engage local companies and schools in some fun and creative fundraising. By buying a brick for the extension they are quite literally helping us build brighter futures for people in their community.“Of course, our residents have been involved in the appeal too, with one recently taking part in the Aberdeen Kiltwalk with her family, whilst other residents have encouraged their friends and family to undertake challenges, such as the Great Aberdeen Run.

Universal Credit is simplifying the system and revolutionising welfare by making work pay. It also helps those who are in work to increase their hours and earnings.                                                     Universal Credit replaces six benefits with one monthly payment and is already being claimed by single jobseekers. And from today, people who would previously have made a claim to Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income support, Working and Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit will instead claim Universal Credit.        A £1.5bn package of improvements making it easier for people moving onto Universal Credit was announced in the Budget. People applying to Universal Credit can now receive a 100% advance on their first payment and the 7-day waiting period for new claimants was removed earlier this year. Among other improvements, from April 2018 the Government also continues to pay Housing Benefit claimants’ rent for two weeks - which is non-recoverable - when moving onto Universal Credit.Minister for Employment Alok Sharma said: “Universal Credit is central to our commitment to help families improve their lives by moving into work. We know it’s working – with Universal Credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. “And now we are rolling it out to a wider range of people in a safe and controlled way. From today, more people, including families and disabled people, can claim Universal Credit and access the extra help it provides.”Single jobseekers are already receiving support from their dedicated work coach to find employment or increase their hours and earnings. Now, all types of claimants will be able to benefit from the improved, personalised, one-to-one support that Universal Credit offers.                                                                                                        Carol Sadler, from Jobcentre Plus said: “Universal Credit offers tailored support, which includes more personalised help from a work coach. The new system is also more flexible, which means people can take on short-term work to develop their skills and build up their experience. “Our staff are trained to support people throughout the claim process. We’d encourage anyone who needs extra help or information to come and talk to their work coach.”Those on Universal Credit will now have 24-hour access to an online account that they can use to manage their claim, including reporting changes of circumstances, checking the details of their claim and date of their next Universal Credit payment. With the application process now completely online, Universal Credit streamlines the system, making benefits simpler to navigate and easier to understand.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

The crew also carried out maintenance work on lights and lanterns.As time went by the vessel was employed in the conversion of automated lighthouses to solar panel operation. When this work was completed in 1996, the ship was taken out of service.An initiative was later launched to preserve the vessel as a floating cultural monument.This ship is representative of a type of specialised vessel from a unique period in the history of Norwegian lighthouses and is open to the public today, Wednesday, afternoon 2pm-6pm, the again from 10am-Noon and 2pm \u0026#8211 6pm on Thursday.More details about the visit of the ship in The Orcadian next week.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions. Chairman Ian Blake of Aultgrishan said it was an exciting setting for competitors and \"will provide visitors to the gardens with a unique opportunity to hear some of the most gifted young inheritors of our much cherished Highland heritage\".

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Thursday 28 Jun 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However as soon as he was able, he was back in the saddle.The supermarket worker was delighted with his recent racing success followed by his selection for the GB squad for the world championships at the end of July and beginning of August.\"I really wanted to retain the national title but this year I knew I had my work cut out as I was up against my friend and main competitor Ben Watson who is a full time GB rider,\" he said.\"It was a great race. I felt good going into it and was able to counter any attacks and came down to a sprint where I was able to take the win.\"The news got better when British Cycling announced the world championship squad for this year with my name on it. I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to pulling on the GB kit for the first time.\"The hard work is paying off and I am hoping this is a stepping stone towards becoming a full-time GB rider. I\u0026rsquom really happy at being given this opportunity, being only 18 years old.\"He said the last eight months had only been possible thanks to the generosity of Moray Estates in paying for all his training and racing travel costs.He also thanked Tesco Dingwall which had been flexible with his shifts, allowing him to travel to races.Last year\u0026rsquos Strathpuffer 24-hour endurance event raised \u0026pound1000 to be divided between Fin and the charity Lupus UK.Thursday 28 Jun 2018 7:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4760309.1530088555!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom peterkin reshuffle was long overdue but when it came it was dramatic","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tNicola Sturgeon\u0026#8217s reshuffle may have been a long time coming, but when it did come it was nothing if not dramatic, writes Tom Peterkin\t\t\t\tSix ministers have gone and there is the possibility of more casualties tomorrow when the First Minister finalises her junior ministerial team.            In the relatively brief history of devolution, one has to go back to Jack McConnell’s reshuffle of November 2001 to find one of comparable ferocity. Then, five senior and two junior ministers went in a reshuffle that earned the then Labour first minister the nickname “Jack the Knife”. Mr (now Lord) McConnell wielded the axe within hours of taking the top job. In contrast, it has taken Ms Sturgeon months, if not years, to carry out a similar exercise.            Yesterday’s reshuffle was long overdue. For many months now a somewhat tired-looking ministerial team had seemed to struggle to get a grip on domestic issues. In some ways that feeling of drift was typified yesterday with the Scottish Government having to deal with news on cancer waiting times and Education Secretary John Swinney shelving key education legislation.As Ms Sturgeon’s right hand man, Mr Swinney was always going to be safe from yesterday’s blood-letting. The same was not true of her good friend, Health Secretary Shona Robison. Ms Robison has been a lame duck struggling to swim against a tide of poor NHS performance indicators. As was clear from her resignation letter, Ms Robison has also had some very difficult personal issues to contend with. In those circumstances, it is perhaps easy to understand why she would want some time away from the pressure cooker environment of Cabinet politics. Ms Sturgeon will be sad to see the departure of one of her oldest friends in politics. But the truth is a fresh face is desperately needed at what is always one of the trickiest portfolios for a government.• READ MORE: Scottish Government Cabinet Reshuffle: Who’s in and Who’s out?            All sorts of spin can be spun about Keith Brown moving into an enhanced depute role with the SNP, but the reality is that Scotland’s economic growth is still lagging behind the rest of the UK. Mr Brown is a casualty of the decision to put his brief under Finance Secretary Derek Mackay’s umbrella – a change that seems entirely sensible. Angela Constance’s departure is perhaps not unexpected with her post going to former public health minister Aileen Campbell. Of the promotions, Humza Yousaf faces a tough job as Justice Secretary. That is clear given the challenges that Michael Matheson has faced, having to get to grips with the dysfunctional nature of Police Scotland. Mr Yousaf has shown himself to be a politician of determination in his handling of the notoriously tricky transport brief – which now goes to Mr Matheson, who remains in the Cabinet. Jeane Freeman, who in a previous life was a Labour adviser, has long been seen as a politician destined for the Cabinet. She has the unenviable task of taking over the health brief that always proves so difficult no matter who is in charge.             So far Ms Freeman has proved herself relatively sure-footed, aside from an episode last year when she was accused of making a clumsy attempt at smearing a nurse in a TV debate.The return of Michael Russell is an indication of Brexit looming on the horizon, while Shirley Anne Somerville faces the intimidating task of setting up Scotland’s social security system."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4760978.1530177430!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland set for hottest day on record","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tScotland could set a new record temperature today after the sunshine yesterday smashed statistics that have stood for a quarter of a century.\t\t\t\tThe mercury hit a sweltering 31.3C in Aviemore in the Highlands, making it the warmest day of the year so far and the hottest June day since 1995.window.twttr = (function(d, s, id) {            Aboyne, in Aberdeenshire, was almost as hot, with a high of 30.1C.

At Luss beach, Loch Lomond, the sizzling temperature saw beachgoers sunbathing and taking a dip in its waters.Karalee Conboy, 35, who travelled from Glasgow, said: “I often come here with my children when the weather is good. It’s good – as long as they are happy, I am happy. We’ll have a picnic and build some sandcastles.“We were going to go abroad but then I thought why go away when we’ve got this on our own doorstep, it’s a lovely place. Scotland is definitely underestimated but it really is one of the nicest places.”Iain Elliot, 47, from Bristol, who towed his boat north last Saturday to enjoy the Scottish sun, said: “It’s something special and we’ve been lucky with the weather.            “I come up every year and it’s a special place. I love the scenery so much and you are never disappointed.”Restaurant worker Marta Garcia, 26, from Spain, said: “I have lived here for three years now and love it. The weather today is so good and I’m really just sad that I have to go to work at 5pm. “This is the first time I’ve been out here in ages when the sun is out and I just want to stay.”It was also the hottest day of the year so far across the UK, with thermometers peaking at 31.9C in Porthmadog in Wales.But with the heatwave expected to continue today, meteorologists said temperatures in Scotland could even go on to break the June record of 32.2C, measured in 1893 at Ochtertyre in Perthshire.            Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said: “We’re keeping a close eye on temperatures, as highs of around 31C or 32C are expected in some places on Thursday. At this point it looks unlikely to beat 32.2C, but it’s not out of the question.”But not everyone has been basking in tropical heat.Shetland, though warmer than it has been for the previous couple of days, saw a much chillier 11C in the coolest parts.However, Scots are being asked not to waste water during the dry weather due to concerns that reservoirs are running low.Scottish Water has issued warnings over supplies in Elgin, Forres, Kinloss and Stornoway, asking customers to “use water wisely”.The firm said the heatwave coupled with increased demand means “efficiency measures” are needed, such as turning taps off while brushing teeth, taking shorter showers, not over-filling kettles and using watering cans instead of hosepipes outdoors. People also warned people to take care at quarries. Police issued a warning on Twitter, saying: “Some quarry lakes may look inviting on a hot summer’s day like today, but there are a number of hidden dangers: Deep water, submerged abandoned machinery and car wrecks, underwater recesses, hidden currents, dead animals, pollution.“More dangers of quarry swimming are sheer faces, falling rocks, quick sand, and believe it or not hypothermia.”"}]
