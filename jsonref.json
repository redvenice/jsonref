Downed power lines lay nearly everywhere, while pine trees were stripped and snapped off about 20 feet highRows and rows of other homes were reduced to piles of debris or crumpled and slumped at odd anglesRows and rows of other homes were reduced to piles of debris or crumpled and slumped at odd angles.Trees were stripped to stalks, roofs were shredded, trucks toppled and boats pushed into buildings. Downed power lines lay nearly everywhere, while pine trees were stripped and snapped off about 20 feet high.Hundreds of cars had broken windows and twisted street signs lay on the ground. In Panama City, 20 miles northwest of Mexico Beach, buildings were crushed and boats were scattered around. Michael left a trail of utility wires on roads, flattened tall pine trees and knocked a steeple from a church.At Jinks Middle School in Panama City, the storm peeled back part of the gym roof and tore off one wall, leaving the wooden floor covered in water. A year ago the school welcomed students and families displaced by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.Nearly 850,000 homes and businesses were without power in Florida, Alabama, the Carolinas and Georgia on Thursday. Search-and-rescue teams fanned out across the Florida Panhandle to reach trapped people in Michael\u0027s wake on Thursday as daylight yielded the devastating scenes.The hurricane, one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the U.S. mainland, left at least seven people dead in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina.Sarah Radney, an 11-year-old girl, was killed in Seminole County, Georgia, when a tree fell on her home. Another man was killed by a falling tree in Gadsden County, Florida. Three others were also found dead in Gadsden County and another man was killed when a tree landed on his car in Statesville, North Carolina.

So many families have lost everything. This hurricane was an absolute monster.\u0027 Michael was a Category 4 storm, just shy of a rare Category 5, when it came ashore. It was downgraded to a Tropical Storm on Thursday as it took its drenching rains to Georgia and the Carolinas.Though weakened into a tropical storm, it continued to bring heavy rain and blustery winds to the Southeast as it pushed inland, soaking areas still recovering from last month\u0027s Hurricane Florence. Parts of North Carolina and Virginia could get as much as 9 inches of rain and flash floods.Under a perfectly clear blue sky, Florida families emerged tentatively from darkened shelters and hotels to an unfamiliar and perilous landscape of shattered homes and shopping centers, beeping security alarms, wailing sirens and hovering helicopters. The full extent of the damage was only slowly becoming clear, with some of the worst areas difficult to reach. An 80-mile stretch of Interstate 10, the main east-west route along the Panhandle, was closed because of debris.Scott said the National Guard got into Mexico Beach and rescued 20 people who survived the direct hit.It was not yet known what had happened to about 280 residents of Mexico Beach who authorities said had ignored evacuation orders as the storm approached the state\u0027s northwest. The town was under a mandatory evacuation order as the rapidly developing storm closed in, but some people were determined to ride it out.     Rescuers searched the Mexico Beach area on Thursday morning after the hurricane made a direct hit on the small town          Lee Cathey, 37, Al Cathey, 71, and Charles Smith, 56, survey damage in the coastal township of Mexico Beach          Boats washed up among the debris of houses in Mexico Beach on Thursday following the devastating hurricane          Firefighter Austin Schlarb performs a door to door search in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael in Mexico Beach Thursday          Jim Bob looks out on the destruction caused as Hurricane Michael passed through the area in Mexico Beach          Bianna Kelsay was rescued from her home in Mexico Beach on Thursday as crews went door to door looking for people          People hold hands as they walk amidst destruction in Mexico Beach in the aftermath of Hurricane MichaelKate Moss and Liv Tyler arrive for Eugenie\u0027s royal weddingMoment page boy falls on the steps of St George\u0027s ChapelPrincess Eugenie arrives at chapel in Peter Pilotto dressWilliam, Kate, Harry and Meghan arrive at royal wedding\u0027Love at first sight\u0027: Princess Eugenie opens up about husband-to-beArmy sends wedding wishes to Princess Eugenie and Jack BrooksbankRobbie Williams and wife Ayda Field arrive at royal weddingPrincess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank arrive for wedding rehearsalPrincess Eugenie and fiancé arrive for wedding rehearsalSarah Ferguson and Princess Beatrice leave St George\u0027s chapelQueen and Prince Philip arrive for Eugenie\u0027s royal weddingThe governor pleaded with people in Florida not to go home yet.\u0027I know you just want to go home. You want to check on things, and begin the recovery process (but) we have to make sure things are safe.\u0027Meanwhile, the Coast Guard said it rescued at least 27 people, mostly from homes damaged along the Florida coastline, and searched for more victims. Among those brought to safety were nine people rescued by helicopter from a bathroom of their Panama City home after their roof collapsed.Thousands of National Guard troops, law enforcement officers and medical teams are working their way into damaged communities to search for survivors.Florida officials also said they were moving patients from damaged health care facilities. The largest hospitals in Panama City shut down and evacuated hundreds of patients due to heavy hurricane damage. Bay Medical Sacred Heart was moving about 200 patients from buildings with blown-out windows, a cracked exterior wall and a collapsed roof.  More than 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast were ordered or urged to evacuate as Michael closed in. But it moved so fast and intensified so quickly that people didn\u0027t have much time to prepare, and emergency authorities lamented that many ignored the warnings. A Red Cross official said it\u0027s possible that as many as 320,000 people on Florida\u0027s Gulf Coast did not evacuate and likely rode out the storm.  President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for all of Florida, freeing federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses.About 3,500 Florida National Guard troops were deployed, along with more than 1,000 search-and-rescue personnel to the area immediately after the hurricane hit.   Kate Moss and Liv Tyler arrive for Eugenie\u0027s royal weddingMoment page boy falls on the steps of St George\u0027s ChapelPrincess Eugenie arrives at chapel in Peter Pilotto dressWilliam, Kate, Harry and Meghan arrive at royal wedding\u0027Love at first sight\u0027: Princess Eugenie opens up about husband-to-beArmy sends wedding wishes to Princess Eugenie and Jack BrooksbankRobbie Williams and wife Ayda Field arrive at royal weddingPrincess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank arrive for wedding rehearsalPrincess Eugenie and fiancé arrive for wedding rehearsalSarah Ferguson and Princess Beatrice leave St George\u0027s chapelQueen and Prince Philip arrive for Eugenie\u0027s royal wedding    The coastal township of Mexico Beach lays devastated after the eye of the storm made landfall there on Wednesday afternoon          Emergency workers Dr. Patricia Cantrell, left, and Ana Kaufmann survey damage at the western edge of town in Mexico Beach          A woman walks through a destroyed store in Springfield, Florida on Thursday          Storm damaged boats are seen crowded together in Panama City on Thursday as residents of the Florida Panhandle woke to scenes of devasation          Buildings were crushed and boats were scattered around in debris in Mexico City"},{"url":null,"title":"Kanye heads straight Apple Store revealing 000000 password TV","story":"    MORE TO SAY: Kanye West headed to the Apple store after delivering his Oval Office rantThe two men then met for lunch at the White House.Not long afterward, West was spotted at the Apple store in Georgetown – the same store where special counsel Robert Mueller was spotted getting some tech support recently.At one point, the rapper stood on top of one of the store\u0027s signature wood tables and asked to give a \u0027keynote,\u0027 according to a Religion News Service reporter who happened to be there.West brought up a topic he had mentioned earlier at the White House, saying he had designed an \u0027updated hat that says make America great but with out the \u0027again\u0027 and Trump wore it.\u0027 It was his take on Trump\u0027s \u0027Make America Great Again\u0027 slogan.He said the president wore it.

Bradley (right) has said          Mr Khashoggi was critical of some of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u0027s (above) policiesMr Khashoggi befriended Osama bin Laden in the 1980s and 1990s in Afghanistan and Sudan.At the time, he was employed by Saudi intelligence services to persuade bin Laden to make peace with the Saudi royal family.Ultimately, Saudi was the only person outside the royal family who knew intimate details of their links to bin Laden – which Bradley says would have been crucial if Mr Khashoggi escalated his bid to undermine the Crown Prince.Bradley believes the Saudis may have also worried that he had become a US asset.Melania steps in to help probe disappearance of Saudi...Saudis BLOCK Turkey from entering embassy where journalist...Share this articleEarlier this year, Mr Khashoggi had established a new political party in the US called Democracy for the Arab World.But Mr Khashoggi\u0027s recent rejection of the offer to return to Saudi Arabia as an advisor – a snub to the Crown Prince - may have been the final straw.Friends of Mr Khashoggi told the Washington Post that for several months, senior Saudi officials were offering him protection, \u0027even a high-level job working for the government\u0027 if the critic returned to the kingdom - but he was sceptical of such offers.    Further evidence that Mr Khashoggi never left the consulate include screen grabs from a WhatsApp chat showing he used his phone minutes before entering the building - and then never againMr Khashoggi was also considered the biggest threat to the Crown Prince\u0027s vision for Saudi Arabia.He was the most well-known political pundit in the Arab world with more than two million followers on Twitter.But Mr Khashoggi was also a political Islamist who \u0027never had much time for western-style pluralistic democracy,\u0027 Bradley wrote.In the 1970s, he joined the Muslim Brotherhood, which aims to free the Islamic world from western influence.In his columns, Bradley says, he urged Crown Prince Mohammed to embrace the rise of political Islam, rather than western-style democracy.Mr Khashoggi\u0027s rising calls for democratic reforms over the past year put him at odds with Crown Prince Mohammed, the kingdom\u0027s most powerful figure.\u0027The Palestinian in Ramallah is much freer than me in Jeddah or Riyadh, he still can go on the street and demonstrate against the deal when I cannot do that,\u0027 Mr Khashoggi said the day before he vanished.          Hatice Cengiz, 36, who waited outside for hours for her fiance Khashoggi to return, has spoken of being left in a \u0027state of deep confusion and sadness\u0027He made the remark in an analysis of the Trump administration\u0027s plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians to the BBC.Last month, he criticised the Saudi war in Yemen, which is closely identified with Crown Prince Mohammed.\u0027Saudi Arabia must face the damage from the past three-plus years of war in Yemen,\u0027 he wrote in the Washington Post on September 11.\u0027Further continuation of the war in Yemen will validate voices saying that Saudi Arabia is doing in Yemen what Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the Russians and Iranians are doing in Syria.\u0027Mr Khashoggi became known as a liberal progressive following his sacking as editor of Saudi daily newspaper Al Watan in 2003.He was dismissed because he had allowed a columnist to criticise an Islamic scholar who is considered the founding father of Wahhabism – a movement that the Muslim Brotherhood has always been at odds with.          Arriving to \u0027death\u0027 - 1.14pm: Jamal Khashoggi, right, at Saudi consulate in Istanbul          On the move - 3.08pm: Vehicles with diplomatic plates leave the Istanbul consulate          One of them, a Mercedes Vito, stops for several hours at Saudi consul general\u0027s residenceMs Cengiz says he left one mobile phone with her before he went into the building, however NBC News reports on claims the journalist had a second phone which he brought with him inside.Investigators are confident they may be able to discover Mr Khashoggi\u0027s fate, using data collected from his Apple Watch - which was connected to the phone he left with Ms Cengiz.  Earlier today, Ms Cengiz spoke of being left \u0027in a state of deep confusion and sadness\u0027, blaming herself for her partner\u0027s disappearance.  \u0027I have this strange feeling like I have failed to look after something so dear,\u0027 she told CNN\u0027s Christiane Amanpour.The 36-year-old described how she is now embarking on the heartbreaking task of cancelling all their wedding preparations.  \u0027It has been a heavy burden to have to stop or even cancel everything we had started,\u0027 she said.\u0027We were planning a life between Washington and Istanbul. Like everyone else, were just hoping to live a happy life. \u0027The mystery has captivated the world, and is already threatening to hurt efforts by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman to improve the image of his country around the globe.          How the \u0027hit squad\u0027, said to include a Saudi special forces officer, swoopedJamal Khashoggi\u0027s rising calls for democratic reforms over the past year put him at odds with Saudi Arabia\u0027s Crown Prince Mohammed bin SalmanMr Khashoggi was a political Islamist who \u0027never had much time for western-style pluralistic democracy,\u0027 John R. Bradley, a journalist who specialises in Middle East issues, wrote in the Spectator.In the 1970s, he joined the Muslim Brotherhood, which aims to free the Islamic world from western influence.In his columns, Bradley says, he urged Crown Prince Mohammed to embrace the rise of political Islam, rather than western-style democracy.In 2003, following his sacking as editor of Saudi daily newspaper Al Watan, Mr Khashoggi became known as a liberal progressive.He was dismissed because he had allowed a columnist to criticise an Islamic scholar who is considered the founding father of Wahhabism – a movement that the Muslim Brotherhood has always been at odds with.And although Crown Prince Mohammed, on the other hand, rejects Wahhabism – whose followers detest democracy as a western invention – he considered the Muslim Brotherhood the main threat to his vision for the kingdom.Most clerics imprisoned in Saudi Arabia over the past two years have ties to the Brotherhood.Since then, Mr Khashoggi has become a de facto leader of the Saudi branch – and therefore, the biggest political threat to the Crown Prince.Furthermore, Mr Khashoggi also had information on the Saudi royal family\u0027s ties to al-Qaeda before the September 11 terror attacks.Mr Khashoggi befriended Osama bin Laden in the 1980s and 1990s.He was employed by Saudi intelligence services to persuade bin Laden to make peace with the Saudi royal family.Bradley, a former colleague of Mr Khashoggi\u0027s, believes the Saudis may have also worried that he had become a US asset.Also, earlier this year, he had established a new political party in the US called Democracy for the Arab World.Mr Khashoggi\u0027s recent rejection of the offer to return to Saudi Arabia as an advisor may have been the final straw.  Worried fiancée: Hatice Cengiz, circled right, makes a call outside the consulateJamal Khashoggi\u0027s fiancee yesterday spoke of her \u0027fear and concern\u0027 for his wellbeing.Hatice Cengiz spent 11 hours waiting for the journalist after he went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain paperwork for their marriage.\u0027I don\u0027t know how I can keep living if he was abducted or killed in Turkey,\u0027 the 36-year-old wrote in the Washington Post, the paper Mr Khashoggi worked for.Miss Cengiz, who lives in Istanbul, said she believed she was the woman seen in CCTV footage taken outside the consulate.\u0027We were in the middle of making wedding plans, life plans,\u0027 she added. \u0027After the consulate, we were going to buy appliances for our new home and set a date. All we needed was a piece of paper.\u0027Miss Cengiz said Mr Khashoggi had visited the consulate on September 28 despite some concern that he could be in danger.She wrote: \u0027Although his opinions had angered certain people, he said, the tensions between himself and Saudi Arabia did not amount to hate, grudges or threats.\u0027He was, however, increasingly worried about an unprecedented wave of arrests in his country.\u0027She said he did not think the Saudis could force him to stay at the consulate, adding: \u0027He did not believe that something bad could happen on Turkish soil. After a positive first meeting with consular staff, who welcomed him warmly and assured him that the necessary paperwork would come through, Jamal was hardly concerned ahead of his second visit.\u0027He walked into the consulate of Saudi Arabia, his native country, without doubting he would be safe there. But after three hours I was overcome with fear and concern.\u0027She went in to ask where he was but was told he had left without her noticing. \u0027Although my hope slowly fades away each passing day, I remain confident that Jamal is still alive,\u0027 she added.

Downed power lines lay nearly everywhere, while pine trees were stripped and snapped off about 20 feet high.Hundreds of cars had broken windows and twisted street signs lay on the ground. In Panama City, 20 miles northwest of Mexico Beach, buildings were crushed and boats were scattered around. Michael left a trail of utility wires on roads, flattened tall pine trees and knocked a steeple from a church.At Jinks Middle School in Panama City, the storm peeled back part of the gym roof and tore off one wall, leaving the wooden floor covered in water. A year ago the school welcomed students and families displaced by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.Nearly 850,000 homes and businesses were without power in Florida, Alabama, the Carolinas and Georgia on Thursday. Search-and-rescue teams fanned out across the Florida Panhandle to reach trapped people in Michael\u0027s wake on Thursday as daylight yielded the devastating scenes.The hurricane, one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the U.S. mainland, left at least seven people dead in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina.Sarah Radney, an 11-year-old girl, was killed in Seminole County, Georgia, when a tree fell on her home. Another man was killed by a falling tree in Gadsden County, Florida. Three others were also found dead in Gadsden County and another man was killed when a tree landed on his car in Statesville, North Carolina.

So many families have lost everything. This hurricane was an absolute monster.\u0027 Michael was a Category 4 storm, just shy of a rare Category 5, when it came ashore. It was downgraded to a Tropical Storm on Thursday as it took its drenching rains to Georgia and the Carolinas.Though weakened into a tropical storm, it continued to bring heavy rain and blustery winds to the Southeast as it pushed inland, soaking areas still recovering from last month\u0027s Hurricane Florence. Parts of North Carolina and Virginia could get as much as 9 inches of rain and flash floods.Under a perfectly clear blue sky, Florida families emerged tentatively from darkened shelters and hotels to an unfamiliar and perilous landscape of shattered homes and shopping centers, beeping security alarms, wailing sirens and hovering helicopters. The full extent of the damage was only slowly becoming clear, with some of the worst areas difficult to reach. An 80-mile stretch of Interstate 10, the main east-west route along the Panhandle, was closed because of debris.Scott said the National Guard got into Mexico Beach and rescued 20 people who survived the direct hit.It was not yet known what had happened to about 280 residents of Mexico Beach who authorities said had ignored evacuation orders as the storm approached the state\u0027s northwest. The town was under a mandatory evacuation order as the rapidly developing storm closed in, but some people were determined to ride it out.     Rescuers searched the Mexico Beach area on Thursday morning after the hurricane made a direct hit on the small town          Lee Cathey, 37, Al Cathey, 71, and Charles Smith, 56, survey damage in the coastal township of Mexico Beach          Boats washed up among the debris of houses in Mexico Beach on Thursday following the devastating hurricane          Firefighter Austin Schlarb performs a door to door search in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael in Mexico Beach Thursday          Jim Bob looks out on the destruction caused as Hurricane Michael passed through the area in Mexico Beach          Bianna Kelsay was rescued from her home in Mexico Beach on Thursday as crews went door to door looking for people          People hold hands as they walk amidst destruction in Mexico Beach in the aftermath of Hurricane MichaelKate Moss and Liv Tyler arrive for Eugenie\u0027s royal weddingMoment page boy falls on the steps of St George\u0027s ChapelPrincess Eugenie arrives at chapel in Peter Pilotto dressWilliam, Kate, Harry and Meghan arrive at royal wedding\u0027Love at first sight\u0027: Princess Eugenie opens up about husband-to-beArmy sends wedding wishes to Princess Eugenie and Jack BrooksbankRobbie Williams and wife Ayda Field arrive at royal weddingPrincess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank arrive for wedding rehearsalPrincess Eugenie and fiancé arrive for wedding rehearsalSarah Ferguson and Princess Beatrice leave St George\u0027s chapelQueen and Prince Philip arrive for Eugenie\u0027s royal weddingThe governor pleaded with people in Florida not to go home yet.\u0027I know you just want to go home. You want to check on things, and begin the recovery process (but) we have to make sure things are safe.\u0027Meanwhile, the Coast Guard said it rescued at least 27 people, mostly from homes damaged along the Florida coastline, and searched for more victims. Among those brought to safety were nine people rescued by helicopter from a bathroom of their Panama City home after their roof collapsed.Thousands of National Guard troops, law enforcement officers and medical teams are working their way into damaged communities to search for survivors.Florida officials also said they were moving patients from damaged health care facilities. The largest hospitals in Panama City shut down and evacuated hundreds of patients due to heavy hurricane damage. Bay Medical Sacred Heart was moving about 200 patients from buildings with blown-out windows, a cracked exterior wall and a collapsed roof.  More than 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast were ordered or urged to evacuate as Michael closed in. But it moved so fast and intensified so quickly that people didn\u0027t have much time to prepare, and emergency authorities lamented that many ignored the warnings. A Red Cross official said it\u0027s possible that as many as 320,000 people on Florida\u0027s Gulf Coast did not evacuate and likely rode out the storm.  President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for all of Florida, freeing federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses.About 3,500 Florida National Guard troops were deployed, along with more than 1,000 search-and-rescue personnel to the area immediately after the hurricane hit.   Kate Moss and Liv Tyler arrive for Eugenie\u0027s royal weddingMoment page boy falls on the steps of St George\u0027s ChapelPrincess Eugenie arrives at chapel in Peter Pilotto dressWilliam, Kate, Harry and Meghan arrive at royal wedding\u0027Love at first sight\u0027: Princess Eugenie opens up about husband-to-beArmy sends wedding wishes to Princess Eugenie and Jack BrooksbankRobbie Williams and wife Ayda Field arrive at royal weddingPrincess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank arrive for wedding rehearsalPrincess Eugenie and fiancé arrive for wedding rehearsalSarah Ferguson and Princess Beatrice leave St George\u0027s chapelQueen and Prince Philip arrive for Eugenie\u0027s royal wedding    The coastal township of Mexico Beach lays devastated after the eye of the storm made landfall there on Wednesday afternoon          Emergency workers Dr. Patricia Cantrell, left, and Ana Kaufmann survey damage at the western edge of town in Mexico Beach          A woman walks through a destroyed store in Springfield, Florida on Thursday          Storm damaged boats are seen crowded together in Panama City on Thursday as residents of the Florida Panhandle woke to scenes of devasation          Buildings were crushed and boats were scattered around in debris in Mexico City"},{"url":null,"title":"Quirky utterly useless facts new QI book","story":"    Legendary broadcaster Sir David Attenborough invented yellow tennis balls Holding hands causes heart rates, breathing and brainwaves to synchronise.In the ten seasons of TV’s Friends, the six main characters drink 1,154 cups of coffee.A glass of calvados (apple brandy) contains seven apples.The word for the inside of the elbow is ‘chelidon’.The Queen takes a monogrammed kettle with her on all foreign trips.The thermostat knobs in most hotel bedrooms don’t work because they’re rigged to save electricity.Mentioning guacamole in your dating profile gets you 144 per cent more responses.

Now we are so happy to be recognised for something else.”The author of some 20 novels, including Desirada, Segu and Crossing the Mangrove, Condé is, according to the chair of judges Ann Pålsson, a “grand storyteller” who “belongs to world literature”.“She describes the ravages of colonialism and the post-colonial chaos in a language which is both precise and overwhelming,” Pålsson said. “The dead live in her stories closely to the living in a … world where gender, race and class are constantly turned over in new constellations.”The winner was announced at a Stockholm library – a stark contrast to the baroque splendour of the Swedish Academy – after a three-fold judging process. Unlike the secretive deliberations of the Nobel jury, the New Academy prize saw Swedish librarians nominate authors, who were winnowed down to a final four by a public vote, the winner decided by an expert jury.The initial four finalists had been reduced to three after Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami withdrew last month, citing a desire to “concentrate on his writing, away from media attention”. Murakami is often cited as a frontrunner for the Nobel.The New Academy, backed by more than 100 Swedish cultural figures, was set up in response to the scandal that engulfed the prestigious Swedish Academy earlier this year, when it emerged that the husband of one of the academy members had been accused of sexual assault. The accusations prompted a wave of resignations from the Swedish Academy, with this year’s award cancelled “in view of … reduced public confidence”. The man at the centre of the scandal, Jean-Claude Arnault, was convicted of rape and sentenced to two years in prison in a Stockholm court last week.The Swedish-Greek journalist and author Alexandra Pascalidou, who helped found the New Academy prize, said she was not alone in feeling “embarrassed and frustrated” about the scandal.“Why was literature, why were authors, going to pay the price, be punished, for what they did?” she said. “So I started calling friends and colleagues and people I met that were crazy enough to believe, to have a vision, to think that we can change what we cannot accept.”Pascalidou said that hundreds of libraries had nominated and almost 33,000 members of the public had voted for the prize. “That was amazing, and this shows the strength of collective effort. This shows there are so many people dedicated to culture and literature.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e9f3c8ea048317745a2bf47671d164630387861/0_193_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=657d4acb40f5cf7dabbce4e0e2bf4a63","title":"javier marias books that made me knausgaard","story":"The author and translator on the guilty pleasure of rereading Ian Fleming, the power of Tristram Shandy – and his childhood love for Just WilliamThe book I am currently reading Per Olov Enquist’s The Chamber Doctor’s Visit (I don’t know the title in English the Spanish one means that).

The author of The Handmaid’s Tale salutes Gaiman’s shadow sideOnce, during an on stage discussion of the type literary festivals go in for, I frightened Neil Gaiman by channelling the voice of the Wicked Witch of the West from the film The Wizard of Oz. “And your little dog, too!” I cackled. “No! No! Don’t do that!” cried Neil. He then explained that he had been petrified by this green-tinted witch as an eight-year-old. Behold: a literary influence had been discovered!The best children’s writers are, somewhere deep in their psyches, still eight years old. They know what is scary. They remember what it was like to have your hand plunged into a Halloween bowl of peeled grapes in a darkened room, having been told they were eyeballs. They relish the delights of being terrified in song and story. They understand the benefits of imaginary horror: yes, this is frightening, but ultimately it can be dealt with, at least in fictional form.Gaiman brought himself up right. He read a great many books proper to his future calling, and absorbed their memes and lessons. When advised to direct his feet to the sunny side of the street, he did – he does not write tragedies – but he also directed them to the shadow side for, as Ursula K Le Guin so memorably put it: “Only in silence the word,  Only in dark the light,  Only in dying life:  Bright the hawk’s flight  On the empty sky.” Or as Beatrix Potter demonstrated, no fun robbing the radishes from Mr McGregor’s garden unless the rabbit-pie dish hovers as a threat. What’s the point of being “Alive, alive, oh” unless you also risk being dead as a doorknob? (Though we must reserve judgment about those doorknobs, in view of A Christmas Carol.)Astrologically, Gaiman is a Scorpio with Gemini rising and, if you go in for that sort of thing – as he must, because I found his horoscope online – this explains much. Scorpio is governed by Pluto, patron of the Underworld as well as of plumbing, underwear, the criminal underworld and everything below the line. Gemini is ruled by Mercury or Hermes: god of thieves, jokes, communication, travel and secrets in addition to which he is the conductor of souls to the Underworld. Most travel to the land of the dead is one-way, but Hermes comes and goes as he pleases, and so do various protagonists in books by Gaiman, including The Graveyard Book.Most of us have a distinct aversion to being dead. We have great difficulty imagining ourselves as simply not existing any more: even the sentence “I will be dead” contains an “I”. So where will the “I” be when the “dead” phase kicks in? There have been a great many answers to that question over time: in a dusty underworld (Mesopotamia) in a complex, many-chambered afterlife, supposing your heart passes its weighing-in test against the Feather of Truth (ancient Egypt) in the asphodel-bestrewn but tedious Elysian Fields, if a Greek hero in Hell, Purgatory, Paradise or Heaven, if an early-Renaissance Christian in the territories of the dead after your journey on the three-day road (indigenous North America), or in the inventive goth worlds of Tim Burton, such as the one in Corpse Bride or in the frolicsome Mexican Day of the Dead realm of the recent Pixar film Coco.But there are many other possibilities. You could – for instance – become a vampire: neither alive nor dead. You could become a ghoul: alive in a way, but consuming dead bodies. Or you could become a ghost: there but not there, visible sometimes but invisible at other times, and frequently spotted in graveyards.It is this latter body of folklore that Gaiman draws on for The Graveyard Book. The hero of his tale begins as a toddler who climbs out of the window while his parents are being murdered and makes his way uphill to the neighbourhood cemetery, where some of the resident spirits – prompted by the fleeting appearance of his ghostly mother – elect to adopt him. Since they don’t know his name, they call him “Nobody” (“Bod” for short), reminding us of the ruse practised by the wily Ulysses during his escape from that pesky Cyclops. So useful to be able to answer “Nobody” when asked who you are.The graveyard in question is very old and contains many layers of time – Celtic, ancient Roman, many centuries of English – so Bod learns different kinds of writing from the tombstones and a lot about history from the inhabitants. There is a misadventure when he tries to go to a real school – he doesn’t exactly fit in – but his persecutors are satisfactorily foiled.It’s customary for heroes to be educated in unorthodox ways – by a centaur, for instance, like Achilles, or by a wizard, like King Arthur. It’s also not unusual for them to have dead parents and strange powers, like Harry Potter.The Graveyard Book is a bildungsroman – a novel about a protagonist’s education – in which Nobody’s unusual tutors are a collection of ghosts, a vampire and a female werewolf, and the strange powers are supernatural abilities granted by the dead people who live (as it were) in the graveyard.This situation has come about because of the deadness of Nobody’s parents at the hands of a collection of arch enemies, all of whom are called Jack, though with different surnames. They are the “jacks of all trades” – Jack Tar, Jack (Be) Nimble, Jack Frost … The other term for a “Jack” in a deck of cards is a knave, and a knave can also be a villain. And so it is in The Graveyard Book, for the Jacks belong to an ancient and powerful order, and Nobody is one of those fabled children tagged by a prophecy – in his case a prophecy that he will mean the end of the Jacks. You can see why they would seek to put an end to him.But when you have as a  a suave vampire like Silas – boundary keeper of the graveyard and obliterator of memories, and able to come and go between worlds, and thus go food shopping – and when said vampire has a backup in the person of an eastern European werewolf called Miss Lupescu, a formidable ally despite her penchant for borscht, then the pro-Bod and anti-Bod forces are more evenly balanced.Will the Jacks find and slaughter Bod before he has grown up enough to be able to foil them? Will the forces of Good-Goth prevail over the forces of Bad-Goth? Will you have as much fun reading this book as Gaiman obviously had while writing it? Of course you will! Will you shed a surreptitious tear during the danse macabre, when the living dance with the dead under the patronage of Death herself, but poor Silas the vampire is excluded, being neither one nor the other? Yes, you will.The Graveyard Book has that many-layered quality so prized in the best children’s books: gripping for eight-year-olds, but with deeper shades and resonances for older people. It’s a true pleasure, from beginning to beginning – for our hero must eventually conclude his education, and graduate from death to life.• Neil Gaiman’s The Graveyard Book is published by Bloomsbury.

The deal is set to be completed in January 2020.House of Fraser said the “Harrods of the north” vision would be realised with the store continuing to host luxury brand names including Hermes, Christian Louboutin, Prada and Gucci.Michael Murray, the head of elevation at Sports Direct, said: “We are overwhelmed and proud to own such an iconic destination. Acquiring the freehold enables us to elevate and invest in the store in order to partner with a broad range of luxury brands in future. This is fantastic news for all parties.”Susan Aitken, the leader of Glasgow city council, said: “A major investment on this kind of scale is a clear vote of confidence in Glasgow, and credit must also go to hundreds of Frasers staff who are absolutely integral to the business’s success and its enduring popularity with city shoppers.“With the future of this iconic retailer’s Glasgow presence secured, we look forward to the new owners building on its cherished relationship with shoppers and reputation as a valued city employer for almost 170 years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19479f261faac63dcfe43cd9bb158ee6bb5855fc/0_95_4079_2447/master/4079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ac6aab9f2a97251ad2d2774da608c1c","title":"stock markets bounce losses ftse asia wall street business live","story":"All the day’s economic and financial news, as shares claw back some of this week’s lossesStephen Mnuchin has also played down the suggestion that China could dump its holdings of US government debt.He claimed such a move would be costly for Beijing, and that there’d be plenty of other buyers anyway.More soothing words, this time from US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin.Asked about the markets, Mnuchin told CNBC that “markets tend to go too far in both directions” - suggesting he’s not too worried about this week’s losses.Mnuchin also insisted that the US economy was in good shape. arguing:“The fundamentals are still very strong.“The U.S. economy is strong. U.S. earnings are strong. I see this as just a natural correction after the markets were up a lot.”Unlike his boss, Mnuchin didn’t blame the Federal Reserve for the sell-off. Asked about Trump’s criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell, Mnuchin replied:I think Jay is doing a good job.Maybe all is forgiven, now shares are are going up again....Financial titan JP Morgan has given the markets a boost, by releasing stronger financial results than expected.JP Morgan earned $2.34 per share in the last quarter, beating forecasts of $2.25 per share.Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, says:“JPMorgan Chase delivered strong results this quarter with top-line growth in each of our businesses, demonstrating the power of our platform.The U.S. and the global economy continue to show strength, despite increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, which at some point in the future may have negative effects on the economy.” Wall Street traders have woken up in a better mood ....Stock markets in emerging economies are recovering some ground today, after suffering their biggest fall in two years on Thursday.Those moves tracked a general improvement in appetite for risk among investors globally, with developed world stock markets recovering after a dramatic two-day slide on Wall Street.“We’re seeing a bit of a rebound in EM stock markets today...we saw a similar occurrence earlier this year when U.S.stocks came under pressure and that automatically improved, and that might be what we’re seeing this time around as well,” said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.US tech stocks may have a better day too...Wall Street is expected to rally when trading begins in four hours.Dow futures are showing a 350 point gain, which would claw back a chunk of yesterday’s 545-point losses.Fiona Cincotta of City Index thinks the worst is over, for now anyway....The global selloff seems to have come to an end and the market is picking up the pieces after the hurricane. The tally: the Dow has lost 1,400 points in two days, Brent Crude is back down at $81 and the dollar is trading at 1.1579 against the euro. Key indices have fallen below their 200-day moving averages and are beginning to look oversold but the underlying economic reasons for a rise in interest rates that had triggered the spike in bond yields and the selloff in equities is still in place.For the moment though, European markets are back in the black and the recovery in Dow futures indicates a stronger start on Wall Street later today.Investors should be wary before ing back into the market today, argues Peter Dixon of Commerzbank.The sharp correction in stock markets in the last couple of days should be seen as a warning shot against the market complacency which has been one of the predominant themes of the last 12 months. Indeed, measures of equity volatility continue to suggest that investors are underpricing risk. We pointed out at the start of the year that equity investors appeared to be increasingly reluctant bulls and were driven more by the FOMO factor (fear of missing out) than the fundamentals, and advised investors to take risk off the table.The cyclically adjusted PE (CAPE) popularised by Robert Shiller suggests that the S\u0026ampP500 has only once been more overvalued than it is today – the late-1990s tech boom – on a dataset going back 130 years:Despite today’s recovery, stock markets are heading for their worst week since February, Reuters points out.The markets are breathing a sigh of relief this morning, says Rebecca O’Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor.But while some investors are piling back into shares, others are being more cautious.Trade wars, rising interest rates and slowing growth have been front and centre in terms of big macro reasons for the rout, but the reality is that investors need to be asking whether valuations can be justified by company profits or have markets got ahead of themselves?The start of the US earnings season sees JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank all reporting today, and good results could provide the catalyst that sees markets recover their recent losses, while disappointing numbers are likely to jeopardise any positive sentiment.Newsflash: stricken UK cafe chain Patisserie Valerie has told the City that its finance chief was arrested last night.This follows the discovery earlier this week of a £20m black hole in the company’s balance, sheet, and “accounting irregularities”.The Company has been made aware that Chris Marsh, who is currently suspended from his role as Company Finance Director, was arrested by the police last night and has been released on bail.Further updates will be released in due course as appropriate.Yesterday, Patisserie Valerie warned that it needs “an immediate injection of capital” to survive. It also revealed earlier this week that it faces a winding-up order from HMRC over an unpaid tax bill of more than £1m that was filed in the high court in mid-September but which the firm’s directors had been unaware of.In another sign of easing tensions, the Vix volatility index has dropped this morning.Reports that the leaders of US and China could hold fresh talks over trade next month are also helping the markets shake off their losses.Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains:The Washington Post reported Trump and Xi agreeing to a side-lines meet at next month’s G20 summit, fuelling hopes for a trade war truce to offset rising bond yields mounting pressure on the US economy.Global markets have calmed down overnight, says Kit Juckes of French bank Société Générale. His morning note to clients is titled “A day off for the horsemen of the apocalypse?”, suggesting he expects less drama today...European trading is underway, and markets are bouncing back from yesterday’s slumps.Confidence may be returning to the markets, after some panicky moments earlier this week.But is it a proper recovery, or just a classic ‘dead cat bounce’?Neil Wilson of Markets sees reasons for optimism:The breadth and depth of the decline in the US market is a concern and suggest earnings and valuations are a factor.In addition to the yield narrative, in many ways this selloff could reflect real angst about the third-quarter earnings season and what outlook is painted by corporates on earnings calls. ... However, on the fundamentals the reasons to be positive remain in place. The fact that the US inflationary pressures are not running out of control continue to suggest this is a picture of good news and fundamental strength.It’s been a cheerier end to the week in Asia.Stephen Innes of trading group OANDA reckons traders need the weekend to recuperate, after some draining days: This market is exhausted from all after the most significant sell-off in global equities since February.Its large shake out the landscape remains no less uncertain and while the current narrative is likely to rage on until Novembers G20 summit at least, prudence suggesting keeping one’s powder dry on this recovering Friday and live to fight another day after yesterday most unpleasant experiences. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.After two days of heavy losses, the financial markets are catching their breath and assessing the situation today.Asian markets have rallied a little overnight, and traders are predicting a bounce-back in Europe this morning too.Anxiety over US interest rates, the trade war between America and China, and signs that the world economy is slowing are all being blamed.Plus, Donald Trump is adding to the uncertainty by firing a series of pot-shots at the Federal Reserve, who he blames for fuelling the sell-off.Here’s yesterday’s liveblog, covering all the drama from Europe, to the US and then Asia:David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says investors remain nervous..... while also wondering if this week’s turmoil is actually a buying opportunity.It was a choppy day yesterday as traders remained cautious about the prospect of higher interest rates in the US, mounting political pressure in Italy, and deteriorating global trading relationships. We saw huge swings in European and US stock markets as traders were battling with the age old emotions of fear and greed.Traders love to snap up relatively cheap stocks, but sharp moves to the downside have left some traders worried this could be the beginning of a major decline. Stocks in Europe and the US finished the day firmly in the red.On the economic front, we get a new healthcheck on Europe’s factories today, plus a new measure of US confidence.Plus it’s the start of the bank reporting season, with Citi, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo all reporting results.

While key players from the US civil rights struggle are household names, challenge the person sitting next to you to name a member of the British Black Panthers or an organiser of the fifth Pan-African Congress. You’re likely to come up empty-handed.In the UK at the moment, children of the Windrush still fight for citizenship as we face fascist movements (which seem only to be gathering steam), and ever-rising hostility towards migrants. Frustratingly, anti-migration sentiment is often upheld by an ahistorical narrative that sees in the imagination of what Britain is an erasure of people of colour from Britain past or present.Black History Month (BHM) was founded at a time when the roles black and Asian peoples played in Britain’s history was even less known than it is today. By making black presence visible, BHM broke open new conversations. And while it was never the cure for a curriculum that fails to produce any meaningful understanding of colonialism, slavery and the independence movements of the global south, now more than ever we cannot afford to lose it.Councils rebranding Black History Month as a way to celebrate all ethnicities are shirking their responsibility to educate their constituents on the histories that have shaped this country, and doing a disservice to the struggles that made it possible at all. Continuing in the legacy of the members of local government who founded it 31 years ago, we should be expanding our knowledge of black British histories, celebrating tales of anti-racism at home, to draw out a path that new generations can continue marching on.For those who want to make change it can often feel isolating, bellowing into a vacuum, with no resonance felt in so many of the rooms you walk into. From the youth workers defying austerity to support at-risk young people, to the activists trapped in never-ending meetings, we can remain so easily disconnected – from one another and a wider movement. With nothing canonised or cross-pollinated, new generations start from zero. The need to connect our contemporary struggles and interlink them with those of generations before keeps growing.As an activist who became politically engaged during a time of a burgeoning anti-racism narrative in activism, I was inspired by groups like Black Dissidents and platforms such as Media Diversified. I was enraptured by the newness of it all, while the voice in the back of my head kept saying “someone’s done this before us”. And they had. Burrowing through the documents at the George Padmore Institute and Black Cultural Archives, I came to realise that I was, as the saying goes, walking in the footsteps of giants.Particularly inspired by the role of artist-activists, from the storytelling of dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson to the visual artistry of Lubaina Himid, I became fixated on their practice. Creativity and cultural production felt like a bedrock of survival for black histories of social change. Art that inherently resists and challenges is an essential part of how we progress. Creating spaces for this kind of art to flourish, writing furiously about the contemporaries who felt like the Himids and Kwesi Johnsons of our era, and growing more creative with my own activism, I began to hone a practice that could make the change I’d been inspired by.I didn’t realise for some time that what I was looking for was a map. A way to navigate the past and present, connect the dots between space and time to make clear which paths lead where, and foster a joined together sense of what black and brown arts activism is, has been and is doing.Earlier this year, the Stuart Hall Foundation came together to do exactly this, digitally and through live events, mapping the work of cultural resistance from the generations that came before, and shining a light on contemporary cultural producers.The Black Cultural Activism Map link orients itself around legendary black and brown creative resistors from across the UK, such as David A Bailey, Maria Amidu, Gilane Tawadros and Julian Henriques, who have produced some deeply narrative-shifting work, constantly reshaping the landscape of arts institutions in Britain. Simultaneously, soundscapes by all-black women choirs and visual collages of modern reparations movements emerge as newer contributions to the map, rooted in and further looking toward a new era of arts activism.Taking archiving one step further, the Black Cultural Activism Map has the potential to circumvent the unease that comes with swimming in new waters and working in isolation. The process redresses the imbalance of who or what enters and exists in the public imagination of Britain, just as Black History Month did before it. Offering a path to all those who would like to know where they’ve been and where they are going, we are gently ushered to go, ready to roll the dice.Black Cultural Activism Map launches 13 October at Platform theatre in King’s Cross, London• Zahra Dalilah is a writer and activist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f8cf85922c8c7b0f05ec7c7daf603e6e11b932/4_0_2152_1291/master/2152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8de3effbcd1360ec17a6cb0bd70e684","title":"food deserts brits obese fresh government","story":"In the past decade there has been a revolution in the British food industry. If you are a comfortably-off urban dweller, it has never been easier to procure a healthy snack. Gone are the days where a soggy sandwich and a packet of crisps were the best you could hope for: now your options include protein pots, prepared mango, chia seed yoghurt, salads containing quinoa. Large supermarkets, too, have cottoned on: if it’s fajita night, a wholemeal wrap is an option. So is reduced-fat cheese. And, if you’re happy to overlook the food miles involved, a larger selection of fresh vegetables than our grandparents could have ever imagined.Yet the food revolution does not benefit everyone. A new study from the Social Market Foundation in collaboration with Kellogg’s has found that more than a million Britons are living in “food deserts” – neighbourhoods where poverty, poor transport and a lack of big supermarkets severely curtails access to affordable fruit and vegetables.These neighbourhoods are often out-of-town estates or deprived inner-city wards which are also “food swamps”, cynically dominated by fast-food outlets. And as a Cambridge University study found last year, people on low incomes who lived furthest from a supermarket were more likely to be obese than those who lived closer.Those of us who have ever had a “cornershop dinner” will know the sort of options available in food deserts: the only shops for miles around sell very little fresh food, so you’re left with a choice between meals such as dried instant noodles or pasta, tinned Scotch broth, and if you’re lucky enough to have a freezer cabinet, pizza. These small shops are also often very expensive, too, but in the trade-off between spending money on transport to the nearest big Tesco for broccoli or a filling, carb-heavy meal, it’s no wonder people opt for the latter.Some people will victim-blame here, and say that these people should get off their lazy arses and cycle to the shops. But there are deep, systemic reasons for these problems. Travel to parts of Europe and you see the reliance of other cultures on the square – a place to meet, converse and for children to play, but also often containing a greengrocer and a bakery and a butcher. This side of Britain feels lost to the big supermarkets, our high streets rendered redundant by out-of-town shopping centres and internet giants. There could be radical architectural solutions, but with government investment in housing dispiriting at best, these are unlikely to take place any time soon.When it comes to tempting supermarkets selling fresh food into these areas it’s a vicious circle – they’ll argue that the deprivation means that the customer base won’t be there, and so the customer base becomes even more likely to make unhealthy food choices (junk food can be addictive, remember), because that’s all that is available. Education plays a part, of course. Cooks like Jack Monroe have shown that with a little initiative it is possible to cook healthy meals on a low budget, though it still doesn’t solve the problem with getting your hands on some carrots if you live in a food desert and can’t afford to run a car. LocoL, a restaurant project in Los Angeles that aimed to bring affordable, healthy fast food to a deprived part of the city has closed partly due to not having enough customers, while Tesco’s US initiative Fresh \u0026amp Easy also failed.This doesn’t mean local community cafes should be discounted – there are other models which are working well. The US scheme of offering loans and grants to fresh food shops to tempt them into areas could be replicated in the UK. There’s certainly much the government could be doing to curb the dominance of the food giants intent on getting us hooked on rubbish. Its only anti-obesity strategy in this regard seems to be insisting that pizzas become smaller, while its commitment to increase the amount of surplus food waste distributed to food banks is good, while at the same time revealing that they don’t expect reliance on these to go away anytime soon.The government’s austerity policies have also played a large part in this problem, making people even less able to reach the food outlets they need and more likely to be hungry or obese. With 4 million children in this country living in households that would struggle to afford to buy enough fruit, vegetables, fish and other healthy foods to meet the official nutrition guidelines, history will not judge them kindly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20f92e7b8a28b294f38f6be0f621da5b4670b11/0_168_4954_2974/master/4954.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=061f22826cfa350f337978b263d12333","title":"great gatsby royal wedding princess eugenie f scott fitzgerald","story":"“Um. This quite strongly suggests that they don’t know what The Great Gatsby is about,” was the reaction of one Twitter user to the discovery that today’s royal wedding was to include a quote from F Scott Fitzgerald’s masterpiece in the order of service. You’d have to think he has a point. The Great Gatsby is a book riddled with adultery and sexual double standards. True love (spoiler alert) fails to win out in the cruellest possible way. The hero dies in the end and nobody shows up to his funeral. And the book has some very pointed things indeed to say about empty materialism, social privilege and the seamy criminal underpinnings of the glitz and glamour of high society.I mean, for a wedding ceremony where the father of the bride is reported to have been furious that the BBC declined to broadcast it live and in full on national television, where the streets of Windsor are to be closed to traffic so that Princess Eugenie (ninth in line to the throne) and her groom Jack Brooksbank (brand manager for a tequila firm) could parade through the streets in a carriage waving to the common people ... it could all look a little bit on the nose, couldn’t it? Among other things, the tragic hero of Fitzgerald’s story is himself ghastly new money striving for reinvention, and the book’s tragedy is the way he is broken like a butterfly on the wheel of old money, social convention and inherited privilege. It’s not a book that roots for any American equivalent of the royal family.That said, it contains some nice frocks, and makes mint juleps sound bloody delicious, so it’s not all bad. And the passage they did choose, describing Gatsby’s magnetic smile, reads well in isolation: “It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself.” But the rest of the novel, of course, goes on to make clear how, to quote another great work, you could take a good look at that face and see that the smile is out of place. Gatsby is a contrivance, a performance, a seductive chimera, a fraud.Still, they could have done worse. Remember the eyes of T J Eckleburg – the vast commercialised peepers of a deus mostly absconditus – lowering sightlessly over the Valley of Ashes? There’s a metaphor for the paparazzi if ever I’ve seen one. Above all – and this is one that will be in the minds of everyone whose car is snarled in a traffic jam, or who has to take the long route round to their kids’ football match, because the couple insisted on a regal procession by carriage through the streets of Windsor at lord knows what cost to the public purse – there’s the killer line: “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy – they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”Fortunately, at the time of writing the royal carriage hasn’t (spoiler alert again) run over anyone’s mistress or similar.But it’s worth remembering that Gatsby contains multitudes. It is a drastic underreading to see it as a simple polemic against wealth and unthinking privilege (though it contains that), or the chimerical cruelty of the American Dream (though it contains that too). It is a love story, and an achingly romantic one. It’s a book about time and loss and hopelessness and the impossible longing to reinvent yourself and capture a moment in and out of time. But, friends, it does end badly.Safest, then, might have been to stick to the epigraph – a couple of lines from a poem by the (fictitious) poet Thomas Parke D’Invilliers: “Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her  If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,  Till she cry ‘Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,  I must have you!’”Better yet, if Jack Brooksbank were to have closed the ceremony by wearing a gold hat and jumping up and down on a trampoline until Eugenie cried “Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover, I must have you!” ... that would have been romantic, wouldn’t it? In fact, I’d have turned out on the streets of Windsor to see it.• Sam Leith is literary editor of the Spectator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37d3c9da42d4f83cb3b00d01ac27826b822e3ef9/109_161_2602_1561/master/2602.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa49e7a58775ee30b4926b99e3751eee","title":"would you have a facebook portal camera in your house me neither","story":"The company says its new smart screen for making video calls is built with privacy in mind. Yeah, we’ve heard that one before …Donald Trump has boasted he could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue and still wouldn’t lose voters. Facebook, it would seem, is confident it enjoys the same unthinking loyalty. Just days after it announced a major security flaw affecting millions of users, the company launched Portal, a smart screen riddled with tracking technology.Portal, which will go on sale next month in the US, is supposedly designed to make video chatting hands-free and immersive. A smart camera follows you around and ensures you stay in view while the system minimises background noise and enhances the voice of whoever is talking. “It’s like having your own cinematographer and sound crew direct your personal video calls,” Facebook says. It doesn’t mention the fact that said cinematographer has a history of flogging your personal information to all and sundry.Oh, but we’ve built Portal with your privacy and security in mind, Facebook has stressed. We’ve designed tools that give you complete control over your private information!

He makes his contractors sign nondisclosure agreements. He values his privacy so much he spent $30m (£22m) on houses near his Palo Alto property with the intention of tearing them down.

The difference, Hytner told the Cheltenham literature festival, was that he no longer worked in the public sector.“I can say all this because I run a theatre that does not receive a penny from the government. I don’t even know who the arts minister is any more,” he said. “The future is precarious and it really matters.”On Brexit, Hytner said: “You will find nobody in the arts world who doesn’t think there is an enormous black cloud on the horizon in the shape of Brexit. We are so dependent on ideas, talent, people moving freely. Freedom of movement was nothing but good for us.“This is a tomorrow crisis for the classical music and dance world,” he said. “It will just all finish. They need players, dancers … they are dependent on them coming in from the European Union. It will take a little longer in my world.”Hytner mocked the reaction of Jacob Rees-Mogg to a recent letter signed by leading figures in music. Rees-Mogg said Handel had not needed freedom of movement to write Messiah in London.“This is untrue twice over,” said Hytner, as people were able to move where they liked without a passport in the 18th and 19th centuries. George Eliot lived in Germany, Brunel studied in Paris and Ruskin in Italy.“In order to be employed as teacher of music to the king’s children there had to be a Handel naturalisation act – parliament had to pass an act just for him. Boy, why are we surrounded by so many people who tell us in a very posh fashion that things are true without even bothering to check whether they are true or not?”Hytner said there were “fantastic young people thriving in the performing arts, really thriving”. But outside London “the situation is looking really grim”. He said “draconian” cuts to local authority budgets had been so severe that “many of them have simply stopped spending on arts altogether”.He added: “There is a real crisis looming. Repertory theatres have gone to the wall. The reps at the moment are doing fantastic work but they don’t know how much longer they can do it for.”There was also a crisis in education, he said, and not only the lack of compulsory arts subjects in the new English baccalaureate.“It is that the downgrading of the arts and humanities in our schools has a really chilling effect. Private schools are spending more and more on arts facilities, state schools are spending less.“We won’t have the audience of the future but, more particularly, we won’t have people who know that they might want to train as actors, they might want to train as musicians, they might want to train as technicians. They just don’t know. That is happening now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f01fcf74d0c8c8e02528ee7d999b407af49396b1/577_469_6515_3910/master/6515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51614b44caa7527783ab4f49e801933b","title":"collected histories not everything was looted british museum defends collections","story":"Museum to give talks in attempt to counter censure over colonial-era acquisitionsThe British Museum is launching an initiative intended to counter the perception that its collections derive only from looted treasures.The monthly Collected Histories talks, which begin on Friday, will provide information on how certain artefacts entered the collection, with the museum saying it will offer a more nuanced take on these stories than is available elsewhere.The museum has long faced criticism for displaying – and refusing to return – looted treasures, including the Parthenon Marbles, Rosetta Stone, and the Gweagal shield.Earlier this year, the art historian Alice Procter’s Uncomfortable Art Tours around London institutions, including the British Museum, made headlines for their attempts to expose the role of colonialism, with those on the tour given “Display It Like You Stole It” badges.Dr Sushma Jansari, the curator of the Asian ethnographic and South Asia collections at the British Museum, said she had devised Collected Histories in response to Procter’s tours.“There are a lot of partial histories and they tend to focus on the colonial aspect of the collecting so you have a bunch of people who tend to be quite angry and upset,” she said.“We’re trying to reset the balance a little bit. A lot of our collections are not from a colonial context not everything here was acquired by Europeans by looting.”The free, curator-led talks will include addresses on objects from colonised places, with the first two on the Solomon Islands and south-east Asia respectively.Jansari said there was a misguided impression that the British Museum did not know – or care – about how artefacts entered its collections, whereas a lot of people were actually researching the provenance of items. She said the talks were an attempt to make that research public and demonstrate “there is a range of contexts in which this material is collected”.Her own talk, in March next year, will include the Bridge collection of Indian art. It was compiled by an East India Company general, Charles Stuart, but not in the way some might assume, she said.“If you just say East India Company, general, collection of mainly Hindu and Buddhist material, most people would just say: ‘Must be looted’,” she said. “But this is a guy who converted to Hinduism he practised ritual bathing, hired two Brahmins to look after the collection, he was absolutely anti Europeans proselytising Christianity in India. When you tell a more nuanced story, it doesn’t fit other people’s agendas but it’s still fascinating. That’s the difference between what we are doing and what other people are doing.”Procter said she welcomed the Collecting Histories series, but added that such projects were often defence mechanisms. She also stressed that even where items appeared to result from fair acquisitions, they had to be seen in the context of colonial relations and power imbalances.“It’s great that the British Museum are engaging with the fact that people want to know about the provenance of things in their collections, but this huge emphasis on legitimate provenance is often a very incomplete story,” she said.“There are plenty of things that are fairly given or bought that end up in museum collections. However, in the Solomon Island collection is a feasting trough that was taken as part of a punitive expedition and you can’t talk about one thing without the other.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e3be3fdc39607b22b71b6329c2a4412abb77c12/0_588_7206_4324/master/7206.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5dc68ea7629a0d3c63d1cb2443de0ab","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A rhinoceros hornbill and a white moray eel are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a2e8ad5ec98e17a81980fcffe0b2115e809dbce/30_452_2417_1449/master/2417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f721775253c2c87921d50a32a2d2c3c7","title":"night and day 1930s fashion and photographs in pictures","story":"A new show at the Textile and Fashion Museum in London recalls classic garments from the 1930s.

But director Nick Cassavetes had sound reasons for choosing Ryan Gosling. “You’re not handsome, you’re not cool, you’re just a regular guy who looks a bit nuts,” he told him.Annoyingly kooky comedy in which the lonely Lars (Gosling) introduces his close-knit Midwestern community to his girlfriend, Bianca, who happens to be a life-sized rubber doll. Avoiding sleaziness by the skin of its teeth – it is only right he and Bianca don’t sleep together, Lars explains, since they’re both religious – this settles eventually for the tone of the self-help manual (“What we call mental illness … can be a way to work something out”).As the junior manager of a Democrat governor’s presidential campaign, Gosling gets to chart the slow curdling of idealism into disillusionment. He is part of a cast that’s so strong and starry (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marisa Tomei, Paul Giamatti, the film’s director, George Clooney) that it takes a good 30 minutes to notice that the film is all gloss and no grit.Middle-of-the-road, multi-strand romcom with Gosling as the pick-up artist who gives Steve Carell, newly separated from Julianne Moore, lessons in love before himself falling for Emma Stone. Notable for the fizzy rapport between Gosling and Stone in the first of their three collaborations to date.Neil Armstrong was notoriously reserved, but there is a thin line between enigmatic and empty, and Gosling, in his second film for La La Land director Damien Chazelle, isn’t always on the right side of it. There is grim humour, though, in the formal, buttoned-up way he addresses his children the night before he makes history: “We have every confidence in this mission.”Or: The Place Beyond Self-Parody. Gosling descends into feigned inarticulacy and mumbling method madness as a tattooed fairground stunt rider reconnecting with an old flame (played by his real-life wife, Eva Mendes). He is weirdly unable here to suggest the character’s dopiness without winking at the audience. There is just too much self-awareness: the lights are off but there’s still somebody home.This retro-flavoured musical reunites Gosling and Stone, but delivers one anticlimax after another: the opening traffic-jam showstopper is like a poor man’s Fame, the songs throughout more Magic FM than magical. But Gosling, who plays a pig-headed pianist earning a crust playing easy-listening standards, gets one of the highlights to himself, casually singing the tentative City of Stars as he strolls along a pier at night.Gosling’s signature role as a nameless stuntman-cum-getaway-driver. (“What do you do?” someone asks him. “I drive,” comes the Zen reply.) He gets a long way on his mute charisma, those feminine features so unlikely for a male action hero, and the ability to look fetching in a snazzy silver jacket. The film, though, is a bust: all flashy bodywork and no gas in the tank.Eye-catching early psycho-work from Gosling and Michael Pitt as the young Nietzsche-adoring students conspiring to commit the perfect murder. Sandra Bullock is on their tail in this partial retread of the Leopold and Loeb case that inspired Rope, Compulsion and Swoon.This modern-day Hamlet, set among US expats in Bangkok, re-teamed director Nicolas Winding Refn with Gosling following the success of Drive. The actor plays Julian, an impotent would-be avenger unable to kill his brother’s murderer Kristin Scott-Thomas offers bleach-blond comic relief as his taunting, incestuously inclined mother. Gosling’s performance is an exercise in studied blankness: you cannot tell if he’s acting or under anaesthetic.Gosling’s haunted, sorrowful face is a good fit for this moody sequel. He also has some pleasing chemistry with his blade-running predecessor, Harrison Ford, with whom he trades pointless punches before Ford finally says: “We could keep at this or we could get a drink.” The men duly drop their fists and repair to the bar. Would that more movie dust-ups ended that way.Gosling and Russell Crowe had both played violent, shaven-headed fascists early in their careers (Gosling in The Believer, Crowe in Romper Stomper), but by the time they teamed up for a missing persons investigation in Shane Black’s rambunctious comic thriller, they couldn’t have been more different. Gosling was now delicate and goofy, as light on his toes as a ballerina, while Crowe was an ungainly, unshaven lump. That mismatch lends the film its spark.With nearly a decade of family-entertainment wholesomeness behind him, it was useful for Gosling to have a calling-card role that drew a line definitively between his Mickey Mouse Club past and his adult future. Nothing could have done the job better than The Believer, an intense psychological thriller based on the real case of a Jewish neo-Nazi. The movie displayed early and incontrovertible evidence of the Gosling USP: an ability to hold a character’s contradictions and conflicts in view at all times.Gosling and his co-star Michelle Williams lived together while preparing to play lovers on the rocks in Derek Cianfrance’s gruelling marital drama. The fragmentary, non-chronological structure allows them to inhabit the happiness and optimism of the couple’s salad days as emphatically as the despair that later comes to overwhelm them. It’s as pleasurable watching them fall in love as it is excruciating seeing them fall apart.Think of this as Drugged Poets Society or To Sir, With Crack. As the drug-addicted Dan Dunne, a teacher who puts the “high” in high school, Gosling gives a frazzled but nuanced performance whether he is grandstanding in class or slipping into inaccessible corners of his own mind. His friendship with a pupil (Shareeka Epps), and his attempts to save her from a local dealer, provide the core of the drama, but the film is alive with curious, devastating details. Best of all is the scene in which Dan is approached by the father of a former pupil. The man wants to share the good news of his daughter’s recent academic achievement, and to congratulate this teacher who set her on the right path, but from within his druggy funk Dan simply cannot be reached.First Man is in UK cinemas from 12 October• This article was amended on 11 Oct 2017.

But I reckon that’s a tenet that needs re-examining.The other week, for example, I went to a vertical tasting of wines by Felton Road, a New Zealand producer I love and whose products I (very occasionally) buy when I’m feeling particularly extravagant. Although these wines age impressively, they’re just so goddamn delicious when they’re young.So, if your own age plays a part in deciding how soon to drink a wine – and younger drinkers tend to prefer vibrant, fruity wines to the more subtle, evolved flavours of older ones (and are unlikely to have a house, never mind a cellar, to store them in) – maybe it is time for a rethink. Never liked the widely admired, slightly petrolly flavours that riesling acquires over time? Drink it younger. Or the forest floor character that’s referred to in the wine trade as “sousbois” and that is frequently found in older reds? Crack ’em open.I’m not saying there aren’t wines that need time good red burgundy, for instance, usually benefits from having four to five years after bottling, as do northern Italian reds such as barolo and barbaresco, which take time to get into their stride. Just-released wines from a new vintage can be a bit clunky – I wouldn’t be drinking most 2018s just yet, except for sauvignon blanc and riesling, which tend to taste better than other varieties in their youth – but there are fewer than there used to be. Even bordeaux is designed to be drunk young these days, and the 2015s and 2016s are particularly delicious.Remind yourself that more wines are wasted by keeping them too long than by drinking them too soon, and give yourself permission to open that bottle you’re keeping for a special occasion. Or, if need be, simply invent an occasion to drink it.Beautiful pure, singing fruit.

He had sought a large pay rise and the suspicion has been that the club do not want to push the boat out for him because they have other options in central midfield.“Everything has been going great with the club – we thought we were in a position where we had agreed a deal but that’s no longer the case,” Ramsey said. “So I just have to carry on playing my football and do my best for Arsenal this season and I’ll leave the rest with the club now.“Am I disappointed? That’s a decision that they have made and things happen in football and you just have to get on with it and carry on playing the best I can. That’s all I am concentrating on and giving my best for Arsenal.”Arsenal could receive a fee for Ramsey by selling him in January but the Wales international, who played in the 4-1 home defeat against Spain on Thursday, did not sound as though he was planning for a mid-season move.“Would I stay for the rest of the season? Of course, yeah,” he said. “I am contracted to Arsenal and I am going to do my best now this season to try and achieve something special.”Emery has said that he does not expect the contractual situation of the squad’s longest-serving player to affect Ramsey’s performance levels. Ramsey joined Arsenal from Cardiff in 2008 for £5m and has won three FA Cups, scoring the winning goals in the 2014 and 2017 finals against Hull and Chelsea respectively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/198eee9361a648d80dd503abbf9a1161a9493caa/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=243962e438eb864423b8ca67db52b257","title":"how many world class players premier league hazard kane salah de bruyne","story":"This time about a year ago, before Mohamed Salah at Liverpool began to push his way to the front of the queue for the nation’s attention, a debate was taking place over whether the increasingly reliable Harry Kane was good enough to be regarded as genuinely world class. Now the same thing is happening in reverse to Alexis Sánchez. By the time the Chilean left Barcelona for Arsenal his credentials as one of the world’s elite were impeccable. Last month a journalist in Santiago made contact asking for information on why Sánchez was failing so badly at Manchester United.Genuinely world class. The first word ought to be superfluous, though in football discussions it never is. No one quite knows the parameters here. Some would argue you have to be good enough to hold down a place in a notional World XI, to take part in a pan-galactic match against Planet Zog. Others think that might be a bit harsh, and suggest any pan-galactic contest would surely be organised along World Cup lines and would therefore require a squad of 23 players, perhaps even a couple more. So you could envisage the criterion as being enough players to form a trial match between the best two sides in the world.Or you could dispense with the extraterrestrial stuff altogether and conclude that roughly speaking, most seasons, we already know the best two sides in the world. A simple, working definition of world class might be reduced to this: anyone good enough to attract serious interest from Barcelona or Real Madrid.With apologies to Bayern Munich, Juventus, Manchester City and anyone else who might feel slighted, that is the definition we will be adopting for the rest of this article. Kane would have made the cut at various times last season – he was certainly on the Spanish giants’ radar and his goalscoring feats were being favourably compared with those of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo – though he did not quite manage enough to boost his standing at the World Cup despite winning the Golden Boot, and he seems to have been suffering a hangover ever since. At his very best Kane might be world class, though since he has been far from his best this season the point is moot.What is not is that other Premier League luminaries are also struggling to stay at the highest standard. Sánchez and Mesut Özil both must have been world class once they not only played for Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively, they both won titles in Spain, not to mention the latter’s World Cup win with Germany. Neither is managing to convince at the moment, in fact some of the more strident supporters of Manchester United and Arsenal have been questioning their wages and value to the team.Class is supposed to be permanent, or at least that is how the saying goes, yet even though the pair are still in their late 20s they would not now be near the top of a list of the world’s greatest players. Theoretically yes, both remain remarkable footballers, though some element of consistency is implied in the world-class compliment. It is not enough just to have the ability, it is also necessary to show it again and again, in different circumstances, sometimes against the odds. Think Sergio Ramos, Luka Modric, Luis Suárez or Andrés Iniesta. Or, at a slightly less elevated level, Gianluigi Buffon, Giorgio Chiellini, Philipp Lahm or Arjen Robben. To be regarded as world class it helps to play the long game, to be around for ages. While one or two seasons of outstanding achievement will certainly claim attention, the stricter judges will demand follow-up.So looking around the Premier League’s elite clubs, who at the moment is demonstrably world class? Perhaps not Kane – until the striker gets back to his best, maybe Christian Eriksen is the most eye-catching player at Spurs and he is out injured. Petr Cech is still capable of impressing but the 36-year-old goalkeeper’s brightest days are behind him.Chelsea have the one player who meets all the tests in Eden Hazard, both in form and in demand. Right at this moment, with Kevin De Bruyne injured, Salah not hitting the heights of last season and N’Golo Kanté deployed in a different role to the one that made him famous, Hazard is unquestionably the Premier League’s outstanding player. The Belgian might not have won a World Cup but he is doing far more for his club at the minute than Paul Pogba is doing at Manchester United. Until Pogba sorts out his apparent difficulty with José Mourinho the most reliable aura of greatness at Old Trafford still surrounds David de Gea.Still in Manchester, De Bruyne’s injury robs City of their most conspicuously creative performer, with due respect to the evergreen David Silva, though few would argue that Sergio Agüero fits most people’s description of an ideal centre forward. Even Pep Guardiola seems to have changed his mind over the last couple of seasons, with Gabriel Jesus not quite ready to step in just yet, although critics might point out that Agüero has rarely been regarded as first-choice striker for his native Argentina in recent years, never mind the world. At Liverpool, Salah was clearly different class last season but the ultimate accolade depends on whether he can do it all over again, and while there is still time to weigh in with another stack of improbable goals the early signs are not encouraging.The list of definites playing in this country at present, then, can be counted on the fingers of a mitten. There is Hazard, with Agüero quite close, and Salah and De Bruyne waiting in reserve. Even if you throw in names such as De Gea, Kane and Kanté it still does not amount to a lot, especially as only one of them is English. Yet barring Spain, which acts as a magnet for top talent from around the globe, the situation is not too dissimilar to that anywhere else.The Premier League’s status as the richest in the world means it will probably continue to attract its share of overpriced flops and Spanish hand-me-downs, though English football cannot be doing too much wrong if it produces players such as Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez, Ryan Sessegnon, Marcus Rashford and Kieran Trippier, and showcase talent of the order of Roberto Firmino, Rúben Neves and Wilfried Zaha. Somewhere in there might be the marquee names of the future, not forgetting the bold path to national attention trailblazed by Jadon Sancho in Germany. The future looks promising, which is just as well, since many of the present crop of expensive imports are fading from view."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b6682c046fa6471278834480755275b6a8af94e/18_65_3467_2080/master/3467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99fd432baa4515d95dbc15f5af5a6c28","title":"the forgotten story of luton town manager idol","story":"Primetime TV would prove the inspiration for one of the most shambolic managerial appointments in football historyBack before X Factor, Strictly and Britain’s Got Talent dominated the Saturday evening TV schedules, there was Pop Idol, the Simon-Cowell-backed singathon on which plucky crooners belted their hearts out for the chance to win a recording contract while the public called in – in their droves – to vote for their favourites.On 9 February 2002 more than 13 million people tuned in to see Will Young take on Gareth Gates in the final of the first series – nearly nine million votes were cast. It was a huge ratings and financial success – even before the No 1 singles and multi-platinum albums, the series made £2.5m from the public’s newfound desire to have its say on premium-rate phonelines.The programme would prove the inspiration for one of the most shambolic (with the emphasis on sham) managerial appointments in football history. As the confetti fell on a celebrating Young, Luton and their manager, Joe Kinnear, were travelling back from a defeat at Rochdale. Kinnear had arrested a decade of decline at Kenilworth Road, taking over as Luton were relegated to the bottom tier in 2001 (the first time the Hatters had been in the fourth tier since the 1960s). He steered the club back to the third tier at the first attempt and followed it up with a more-than-respectable ninth-place finish in 2002-03.Luton, though, had been caught up in the fallout from ITV Digital’s explosion the year before – there were reports of the club losing £500,000 a month. At the end of the season, owner Mike Watson-Challis sold the club to a mysterious consortium for just £4. The consortium remained anonymous but a smarmy, smiling frontman arrived at Kenilworth Road – John Gurney.Gurney claimed to be backed by international investors whose identity would soon be revealed (spoiler alert: they never were). In the meantime he set about sowing chaos and floating a series of madcap ideas. He planned to change the club’s name to London Luton FC, to match the airport. He suggested a merger with the Milton Keynes-bound Wimbledon was not out of the question. He would build a 70,000-seat stadium next to Junction 10 of the M1. On stilts. With a Formula One circuit attached.But in the short term, he needed a new manager. The vacancy had arisen when, three days into the new ownership regime, the hugely popular Kinnear and his assistant Mick Harford were fired. By post. Kinnear had to go to the sorting office to collect his letter as it was sent recorded delivery. “I think it is the saddest day in the club’s history,” Harford, a bona fide Luton legend, said. “What have I done to warrant being dismissed in such a cold and callous manner? My heart and soul was always with Luton Town and I’m devastated.”The original plan had been to appoint the former England defender Terry Fenwick (most recent managerial spell: a seven-game winless tenure with Northampton) but fan fury at the sackings prompted a rethink. Roger Terrell and Lee Power, set to take the roles of chairman and vice-chairman, quit before they started after being greeted at Kenilworth Road by a hail of fruit flung by irate supporters.With supporters boycotting the club, Gurney needed to get the fans onside. An attempt to renegotiate with Kinnear and Harford floundered. Then came the brainwave: Manager Idol. “We’ve got to find an acceptable way of having an appointment made, without being seen to give way to the mob,” said Gurney. “So we’ve come up with the idea of Manager Idol based on Pop Idol.”The final decision would be split between five votes: players, shareholders, season-ticket holders, the board and the general public. The premium lines – 50p per call – were opened. They closed at midday on Monday 23 June. A press conference for the unveiling was scheduled at 1pm … the same day. In the meantime, Gurney set about attempting to agree terms with the shortlisted trio.It was all predictably chaotic. Gurney initially revealed he had agreed terms with Kinnear to return should he win, then admitted he had been unable to contact the former manager all week. No matter. “We’ve two excellent candidates in Steve and Mike Newell,” Gurney cheered. But the day before the polls closed, Cotterill threw a ner in the works. “I had a very good meeting with Mr Gurney,” he said, “and I was very flattered to be offered the job from 70 candidates, but I just think it was the right club at the wrong time.”Handily, filmmakers from the long-running BBC documentary series Trouble At The Top were given behind-the-scenes access for the big day. The resulting half-hour programme, aired a year later, really has to be seen to be believed.With media already gathering at the ground, a fresh-faced “I know that sounds sexist but I am sexist” Newell arrived at Kenilworth Road. There was no sign of Cotterill or Kinnear, who with the seconds ticking down towards midday still led the public phone poll. “There’s all sorts of chaos,” said Gurney, suggesting there has been some sort of technical problem. Then came an unbelievable – in a very literal sense – late swing towards Newell in the general public vote. He, conveniently, won it by just four votes.Players and season-ticket holders had apparently voted for Kinnear, shareholders and the general public (thanks to that late swing) for Newell. So it was down to the board. “We will appoint Mike Newell regardless of the telephone poll,” Gurney told the documentary team. “For two reasons: one is we failed to agree terms with Joe Kinnear, Steve Cotterill is not here and Mike is. And we said whoever was available and we agreed terms with by 1pm today would be the new manager, so Mike is the new manager.”Clear as mud. Newell looks thoroughly bemused throughout the documentary but had an initially successful spell at the club, guiding them to promotion in 2004-05 and 10th in the Championship the following season (a position that remains their highest since 1992).And Gurney? At the end of July the club’s supporters trust – having denied Gurney revenue with a boycott of season tickets – ingeniously bought the club’s debt from Watson-Challis and placed it into administration, forcing Gurney out. “If they expect me to walk away from Luton with nothing, I’ll make very sure there’s nothing to walk away from,” he growled.After a few downs – three relegations in a row and five years in the Conference from 2009 after starting the previous season with a 30-point penalty, 10 for irregular payments to agents, 20 for failing to come out of administration with a CVA agreement – Luton are chasing promotion in League One. And Gurney was declared bankrupt in 2008."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d4a8f319a4844bfe9a52ae8663e4f0d014a9f2d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3ab457ae18da55ea10217e7cf50e185","title":"girlefriend contact with guy used to hook up with","story":"She says they were friends before they became ‘friends with benefits’, but she has been lying to me about how often they used to see each otherI am going through a rough patch with my girlfriend of five months.

Authors Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke explain how they got their big idea off the ground with working lunchesIt is often said that there is a book in all of us, but not all of us possess the grit, determination and means required to bring that book to fruition. By pooling their skills and working collaboratively, friends and co-authors Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke were able to turn their book dream into a reality.Billed as a manual for modern life for a generation of British black women, Slay in Your Lane is an ambitious debut, ning topics from education to work, dating to health, and money to representation. But what sets this guide apart from its rivals is the fact that it’s built on collaboration, combining the experiences of not just Adegoke and Uviebinené but the insights of women in their own networks, as well as interviews with dozens of Britain’s most successful black women.Today, the duo are practising what they preach. It’s a sunny midweek afternoon in August, and journalist Adegoke and marketing specialist Uviebinené are doing what they so often do – thrashing out plans for their next business move over a bite to eat and a glass of wine. The venue is stylish wine bar and eatery Sapling on Dalston’s Kingsland Road and they’re joined by one of the many women they collaborated with for the book – Anne-Marie Imafidon. She’s co-founder of Stemettes, a social enterprise that inspires young women to progress in the science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) industries. The hot topic of conversation is the merits of creative collaboration.Uviebinené and Adegoke first met as freshers at Warwick University and bonded after noticing how few other black women there were on campus. Five years later, out of university and straight into the workplace, the issues of representation that first brought them together were more prominent than ever. It was after one particularly frustrating morning that Uviebinené rang Adegoke and suggested she write about their experiences. Adegoke replied with an emphatic “yes” and then an equally emphatic “but let’s do it together”.This signalled the start of a creative collaboration between the best friends, a mode of working that they both believe has been the secret ingredient to the resulting book’s success. For the two first-time authors with no publishing experience or connections to the industry, it was the decision to do it together that gave them the confidence to jump headfirst into the project. “Because there were two of us and we really believed in each other, the book went from being the twinkle of an idea to a physical proposal very easily,” Adegoke explains. “Doing it together meant we could constantly encourage each other.”Living together as they collaborated on the book meant that any time outside of their working schedules could be dedicated to dreaming up ideas for the project. Naturally, shared mealtimes became the optimum place to debrief on anything new. The pair definitely used to bond over food, Adegoke says, describing the “delicious, unusual” dishes Uviebinené would make for her: “Things like jerk salmon, pasta and seafood.” Often, friends would drop by and they’d enjoy a Thai feast and a bottle of wine. “Eating and debriefing is very much a highlight of my week,” Adegoke adds, “no-one’s ever too busy for a good meal, and it’s one of the few times in a week I can properly find out what everyone’s up to.”Beyond their own friendship group, the pair reached out to other women they knew to get involved, for help with everything from focus groups to photo shoots. Ideas were tried and tested over informal social settings, very often over food and wine. “A meeting room would feel too serious,” Uviebinené explains. “You eat, you relax and ultimately you let your guard down,” she says. “Dinner parties are always interesting, because a lot of friends have ‘side-hustles’ that they’re trying to get off the ground alongside their nine-to-five jobs. There are always a lot of ideas being bounced around over food and wine and lots of words of encouragement and advice.”The importance of women encouraging and supporting other women is critical now more than ever and Adegoke is refreshingly straight-talking on the topic. “We live in a world where most things work against women,” she says, “and on another level they work against women of colour, so it’s incredibly important for us to be there for each other.”Imafidon agrees, in her role at Stemettes she’s working to get women interested in fields too often focused towards male students. “There’s this saying: ‘You can’t be what you can’t see,’” she says. “I think it’s really important to set up environments where girls can see all the possibilities, and beyond them.”Between breaking open new industries and breaking bread with your trusted support network, collaborating on ideas and sharing advice is clearly on the menu for an increasingly social group of creative women.Made for sharingFrom delicious food and wine to music, art and words of wisdom, Campo Viejo believes that life’s better shared.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes. It won’t be any worse for it.Best paired with …With its crisp, fresh flavours, white fruit aromas and delicate stream of bubbles, a glass of perfectly chilled Cava Brut Reserva makes an ideal accompaniment to the sharply-sweet flavours of rhubarb charlotte.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

A projection of the late singer will “perform” digitally remastered arrangements of her songs, backed by a live band, singers and what the production company Base Hologram calls “theatrical stagecraft”.Winehouse’s father, Mitch, described the endeavour as a dream. “To see her perform again is something special that really can’t be put into words,” he said. “Our daughter’s music touched the lives of millions of people and it means everything that her legacy will continue in this innovative and groundbreaking way.”Mitch Winehouse said the tour will raise money and awareness for the Amy Winehouse Foundation. The charity educates young people about drug and alcohol misuse, provides support for those at risk and supports the development of disadvantaged young people through music.The show is expected to last 75 to 110 minutes.The Winehouse tour is Base Hologram’s third such project. Productions featuring Roy Orbison and the opera singer Maria Callas are currently playing. Since 2012, when a hologram of Tupac appeared at the Coachella festival in California, the technology has become increasingly common.A hologram of Billie Holliday performs daily 40-minute shows at the Hologram USA Theater in Los Angeles. A similar tour featuring the likeness of Whitney Houston was scrapped in 2017 after her estate said the technology was not ready. Other tours are planned featuring the metal musician Ronnie James Dio and Frank Zappa.Abba have said they will use the technology as part of a new “virtual experience” expected to debut next year. Abba’s Benny Andersson said in 2016: “We’re inspired by the limitless possibilities of what the future holds and are loving being a part of creating something new and dramatic here. A time machine that captures the essence of who we were. And are.”Winehouse’s last performance was at the Tuborg festival in Belgrade on 18 June 2011. The chaotic set, in which Winehouse slurred lyrics and forgot the names of her band members, led to the cancellation of a European tour. She was found dead at her home in Camden, north London, on 23 July 2011.A new documentary, Amy Winehouse – Back to Black, will be released in November. It includes “previously unseen footage of Amy” and new interviews with her collaborators Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05367e6d4a8181576a2ce04fe1e16c80d6128522/0_6_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ae98d6d21e4c0000980947002a7008a","title":"camila cabello i got to create myself again i didnt have to be this shy girl","story":"She became famous with the girl group Fifth Harmony and now she’s won four American Music Awards as a solo performer. Meet the star behind the addictive, inescapable single HavanaHollywood is used to famous people wandering around, but when Camila Cabello skips on to the terrace of the fancy Los Angeles hotel where she is staying, heads begin to turn. It is the morning after the American Music Awards, where she won four of the five categories she was nominated in. On Tuesday, she gave a knockout performance of her new single Consequences, with a full orchestra, in a ballgown fit for a Disney princess. But today, she looks like a student in jeans and a checked shirt hanging open over a Pink Floyd T-shirt. She asks that I sit next to her, rather than across from her. “I like to be close,” she says, shuffling up the sofa. She talks fast and at volume, in long sentences that eventually loop back to a point she was making five minutes ago. Considering that she is the pop star of the moment, she seems oddly unselfconscious.Cabello rose to fame as a member of the American X Factor-created girl group Fifth Harmony. As is often the way with pop groups, there is usually one you can’t take your eyes off. Cabello was that one. Even in the pop game, natural charisma is rare, but it was obvious from the audition stages of the show that she had buckets of it. Within moments, most of the people in the restaurant we are in are trying to pretend they aren’t looking at her.At 21, Cabello has had the year of her life. She has been draped in accolades for her debut album, Camila, and its addictive, inescapable single Havana. It wasn’t Cabello’s debut solo single – towards the end of her time in Fifth Harmony, she had tried a few tracks and collaborations on for size – but it was the one that felt most like her. It almost wasn’t a single at all her management wanted her to go with a song called OMG. Cabello fought for Havana. She had a gut feeling about it and suggested they put both out to see. Only the latter made it on to Barack Obama’s 2017 end-of-year playlist, and it has been streamed more than a billion times. “Everybody was like, it doesn’t have enough production, it’s not radio-friendly enough, it feels too slow, it’s a cool piece, but people won’t get it, only Latin people will get this. And I was just like, let’s just put it out and see what happens.” She smiles. “And …”I imagined some executive grumbling that it was too Latin, and ask if she was insulted. “No! The people who said that were my family,” she laughs.Cabello was born in Havana to a Cuban mother and Mexican father and lived between the two countries until her mother brought her to Miami when she almost seven. Her father followed 18 months later. “I had a Disney calendar where I would X the spots until my dad met up with us in the United States,” she recalls.Her family have always referred to her by her middle name, Camila, although she was born Karla, but she was too shy to tell anyone at her new school that she preferred to be Camila. It wasn’t until she auditioned for The X Factor, at 15, that she publicly reclaimed Camila. “They asked if I wanted a stage name, and I said Camila because I hated my name. I hated Karla. It was like this rebirth. I got to create myself again. I was Camila, and then suddenly I didn’t have to be this shy girl in the classroom.”Her shyness is something she has to deal with, even now. “I noticed yesterday, I get really nervous before awards shows, and whenever I go up to accept an award, like the first thing I think about is: fuck, now I have to …” Her hand jerks up to her mouth. “Sorry, excuse me!” She is hyper-aware of her young fans to the point of trying not to swear. She starts again. “Now I have to talk in front of all of these people because that’s not my comfort zone, you know?”She has a way of darting around seemingly unconnected subjects and lassoing them together, and at this point returns to moving to the US as a child. “I never thought about it when I was little, but there is something shocking about moving to a new country and not speaking the language.” When her new teacher asked her if she spoke English, she remembers, she lied and said: “Yes.” She puts on a thick accent to mimic her younger self. “I haven’t even said it until this interview, but I feel like there are memories of me being very introverted and shy when I was in Cuba. I hated family parties. I would start crying and lock myself in a room because I was overstimulated,” she says.She considers herself an unlikely pop star. “I always hear stories of people who became singers and musicians who put on shows for their families when they were very young or were the class clown or always singing in class, and people saw it coming for them. I don’t think people saw this coming for me.”Cabello is happy to talk about her family’s experiences of coming to the US because she thinks it matters to hear human stories. At the Grammys in January, she gave a speech in support of the Dreamers, the children of undocumented immigrants fighting to stay in the US. “I’m a proud Cuban-Mexican immigrant … and all I know is, just like dreams, these kids can’t be forgotten and are worth fighting for.” She once left the stage with Fifth Harmony shouting: “Don’t vote for Trump!”“It definitely hits really, really hard,” she says, of the current hostile climate. “I feel like, with everything in life, there has to be some kind of emotional trigger for people to look at something differently. When there’s just statistics, and talking, I feel like people lose the humanity.”When she was little, Cabello wanted to be on the Disney Channel her parents said she could audition for something, but only once she turned 15. When she did, instead of having the traditional quinceañera celebration, she asked them to drive her to North Carolina, 14 hours away, to try out for The X Factor. The producers told her she was an alternate who might get the chance to audition if there was time at the end of the day. For the first two days, there was no time. When she finally did sing, her cover of Aretha Franklin’s Respect wasn’t even broadcast. “I was so sad,” she says. But they liked her enough in the end to pull her into a group with four other girls, One Direction-style. Fifth Harmony were only third in the contest, but they were the ones who became stars.They were together for almost five years. Cabello started writing songs when she was 16, but the band had a five-album deal, so she assumed she would give them to other people. “I just wanted to cultivate my songwriting muscle. But then I was like, these stories are too close to me, and I’m kind of a control freak. I just like doing all of it.” Her solo ambitions fell foul of the Fifth Harmony vision and, in December 2016, they released a cutting statement informing their fans that Cabello had told them she was leaving, via her representatives. Cabello hadn’t known it was coming, and the animosity continued: a few months later, the group’s first performance as a four-piece saw them theatrically pushing a fifth figure off the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards. She thinks that being a teenager in that situation made it infinitely worse. “If I were older, I would have felt it differently. I think everybody would have handled it differently. But being really young was really hard and scary because I didn’t have enough life experience to, I don’t know …” She trails off. “Yeah, that was really, really hard.”When Cabello writes notes to her fans online – apologising for not being on social media enough, or announcing a new single, or even giving her side of the Fifth Harmony story – she always signs off with, “love only, Camila”. It is something she used to tell herself in the aftermath of quitting the group. “When I left the group, and when all that stuff was going on, I started to use this mantra to myself, of ‘love only’. Any time that I would feel scared, any time that I felt doubt, any time that I felt like I couldn’t do it, any time that I felt there was conflict between any of us, or on the internet, I would repeat to myself, and say to my fans, love only, love only. When it comes to the internet, it’s a powerful thing to say, because there’s no hatred here, no anger here, no resentment, no bad feelings, I don’t want any drama, I don’t want any negativity, just, love only. I won’t let anything else into my sphere.”Consequences marks the end of the Camila phase Cabello is already working on its follow-up, though she can’t tell me anything about it yet, other than that she intends to stay in Miami to work on it in the house she bought for her family last year. “I can’t be away from home any more.” True to form, she had to fight for Consequences people wanted her to release She Loves Control, an upbeat empowerment-banger that leans towards her sensual Havana side. But she decided to do a new orchestral version of a ballad instead.She brings up what her producer Frank Dukes said when she was weighing up recording a song that she knew would be big, but that she didn’t feel close to. “He gave me a good piece of advice, about protecting your excitement. That’s so true because, hopefully, I want to have a long career.” After the year she’s had, I laugh at the “hopefully”, and she looks aghast. “Well, it’s not guaranteed! You don’t know. I don’t know.” She sounds every inch the underdog. “But I’ll give it my best shot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75f48fccf652e97d216c03e9ce6a5405e595773c/0_111_4253_2551/master/4253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2414abdacae4f934e69aec8e88bae28e","title":"taylor swift democrats midterm election celebrity political endorsements","story":"More than 160,000 people registered to vote after the singer backed Democrats for the midterm elections– but some in Nashville don’t like celebrities to ‘force views’ on votersMore than 160,000 people registered to vote in the space of 48 hours after Taylor Swift finally weighed in on American politics this week, sparking excitement on the left that the country-cum-pop star could even seal a Senate seat in Tennessee.Swift’s declared her support for two Democratic candidates in a post on her Instagram account on Sunday. Less than five weeks ahead of the November midterm elections, which are widely seen as a referendum on Donald Trump’s America, Swift’s intervention has prompted a mixture of praise, chin-stroking and outrage.The 28-year-old is far from the first celebrity to express her political views, but her young fans – she has more than 112 million followers on Instagram – are seen as particularly loyal and impressionable.But will the Swift intervention make a difference?“One hundred percent,” said Tee Cahours, who was tending bar at Crazy Town in Nashville’s touristy Broadway strip. “She’s a huge icon not only in pop but country music – she’s the reason that nowadays people are more likely to listen to country.“Purely because of that reason her fans will say: ‘Oh, Taylor Swift likes this person, I’ll trust them.’”Crazy Town is one of about a dozen almost indistinguishable – live band, happy hour discount on Miller Lite, faint but distinct smell of vomit – establishments that line Broadway in downtown Nashville. The crowd is mostly greyhaired, and frequently inebriated, but at 20-years-old, Cahours is in the age bracket of people who might be seen as susceptible to Swift’s politics. Cahours said she was not a Swift fan – but she understood her potential influence.“And if he was to post that he was going to vote for a specific presidential candidate, I would be more likely to vote for who he said he was going to vote for. It’s almost the same thing as children voting for the same person as their parents voted for, and I think it’s the same thing in the music industry.”According to Vote.org, a non-partisan group that seeks to boost turnout in elections, there was a spike in voter registration after Swift’s post, which mentioned the website. By midday on Tuesday – less than 48 hours after Swift’s post – more than 169,000 new people had registered to vote, Kamari Guthrie, director of communications for Vote.org, told the Washington Post.By comparison, Vote.org only added 56,669 new voters during the whole of August.The two Democrats swift endorsed were Phil Dresden, who was governor of Tennessee for eight years until 2011 and is hoping to make it to the US Senate, and Jim Cooper, who is running for the House in a district which encompasses Nashville – traditionally a more left-wing dot in the midst of a conservative state.Some believe that if Swift can make a difference, it will be at the local level.“She’s from the area,” said Kip Wood, a twentysomething who works as a tour guide in Nashville. “It’s a home town hero kind of thing. Also, it’s kind of liberal here.”Wood, who is originally from south Georgia, was drinking light beer in the Red Door Saloon, a mile west of Crazy Town and a stone’s throw from Swift’s penthouse apartment in Nashville’s midtown district.“But outside of Nashville I have no clue.”That may be the fly in the ointment for those hoping Swift could help Democrats at a statewide or national level.Celebrity endorsements, in American politics at least, have been happening for decades. The Rat Pack, including Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr and Dean Martin, recorded an alternate version of Sinatra’s hit High Hopes during John F Kennedy’s 1960 presidential campaign, while 40 years earlier Warren G Harding, a Republican, was supported in his successful presidential run by silent film stars Douglas Fairbanks, Lillian Gish and Pearl White.But for all the attention the backing of famous people tends to attract, the jury is out on the impact of celebrity political endorsements, on a national level at least. The consensus among political experts seems to be that endorsements are unlikely to change voters’ minds unless they are particular fans of that celebrity.The standout example is that of Oprah Winfrey endorsing Barack Obama in his 2008 primary race against Hillary Clinton. University of Maryland economists Craig Garthwaite and Tim Moore researched the impact of Winfrey’s backing and believe she was responsible for an additional 1m votes for Obama.Time will tell whether Swift can wage a similar influence. While Cahours and Wood believe she will summon their peers to the polls, the view from the older crowd, being steadily disgorged outside the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum on Thursday, was rather different.“I am a diehard Republican with conservative views,” said Michelle Marks, a 49-year-old from Pennsylvania. Marks was hovering close to the museum’s Taylor Swift Education Center, a series of classrooms where children can attend classes on songwriting and music.“Most country people are conservative. I think you’re entitled to your opinion but just because you’re a celebrity you don’t need to force your views on me.”Marks, who said she liked Swift’s country music but was “not a fan of her pop music”, was at the museum with her husband, David Marks. A gruff, mustachioed military veteran, David Marks was celebrating his 57th birthday on Thursday. He said he would not be influenced by Swift’s Democratic tendencies.Among the museum’s wares is a gold-plated Cadillac that once belonged to Elvis Presley – it has a refrigerator and record player in the back – and outfits and guitars played by the likes of Hank Williams and Dolly Parton.Paulette Nordahl, who was in town from north California for a “girls weekend” with a friend, was looking for the Garth Brooks exhibit, having already peered at items once belonging to her other favorites George Strait, Randy Travis and Helen Jackson.“You can understand the words,” Nordahl, 67, said of her attraction to country.“The music – you can actually hear it, and it has a nice rhythm. As long as it’s not twangy.”Nordahl a retired schoolteacher, said that despite her love of Brooks, Strait et al, she would never vote strictly at their behest.“I’d still be looking into all of it pretty darn good,” Nordahl said.“I think everyone should use their own mind, and their own heart, and do what they think, not what someone else thinks,” she said.In early November, we should get an indication of whether people have followed that advice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceba4ebe64f7634e4b304f2ccc97b66f69eac414/0_76_3234_1940/master/3234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b4d28451b18f2c00c2dff2c42bdf9f2","title":"royal wedding princess eugenie jack brooksbank windsor","story":"Kate Moss and Robbie Williams among guests in Windsor for second royal wedding of 2018Roads were closed, balloted tickets offered to members of the public and the streets of Windsor scattered with royal devotees, but this was, insisted the father of the bride before the service, “not a public wedding. This is meant to be a family wedding.”And so it turned out when Princess Eugenie, the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, married Jack Brooksbank, a “tequila ambassador”, at St George’s chapel on Friday, in a service that was both a highly formal royal event and a somewhat idiosyncratic ceremony reflecting the distinct character of the younger generation of royals.As befits a ceremony where guests ranged from the Queen to Ricky Martin, the service was conducted by the Dean of Westminster, with music by Andrea Bocelli, while the bridal party included Prince George and Robbie Williams’s daughter Teddy.The readings included a lesson from St Paul’s letter to the Colossians and an extract from The Great Gatsby, read by the bride’s older sister, Beatrice, which raised eyebrows for its description of the lead character as “an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over 30, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd”.Eugenie, who is ninth in line to the throne, met Brooksbank in 2010 while he was working behind a bar in Verbier, a ski resort favoured by the royals. Describing their “love at first sight” encounter in an interview on the eve of the wedding, he said: “We just stared at each other.” Eugenie said it was his “huge, windscreen wiper wave” that first convinced her he liked her.The groom described Eugenie, 28, as a “bright, shining light”, while she said: “Jack is the kind of guy who, you know, when you are lost at a party … he will walk in and he makes everyone feel so special. He will scoop you up and talk to you and make you feel a million dollars.”Brooksbank, 32, who went on to manage the London nightclub Mahiki, works as a representative for a tequila brand launched by George Clooney. Eugenie, who is employed as a director at the London art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, does not receive any money from the sovereign grant, which replaced the civil list, but is supported from her father’s private income.The BBC had demurred when offered the opportunity to broadcast the ceremony live, as it had done with the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May, so the honour fell to ITV, anchored by the This Morning presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford.Although senior royals may be accustomed to a more stately tone, the broadcaster’s more informal approach – Langford asked if the pair wanted “any advice … from an old married couple” – perfectly suited the event. The guestlist of 850 – 250 more than the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – was due to the couple having “so many friends that they need a church of that size to fit them all in”, the Duke of York said.The dean broached the subject of the pressure of royal weddings and marriages in his address, noting that “of course we know … that marriages, even between the kindest and most careful people, can founder because of pressures unforeseen”.The “miracle”, he said, was that “so many of us keep on hoping”, adding that the newlyweds “have acknowledged their need of your support and your encouragement. They want you to believe in them.”As the ceremony ended, the couple paused on the steps for the now customary kiss, followed by a short carriage drive through the streets of Windsor, necessitating the closure of the centre of the town and a policing bill to taxpayers estimated at £2m. The TV coverage then paused for a break in which there was a cannily placed advert for Bocelli’s new album.Though the weather stayed dry, guests arriving at the chapel faced a cold wind that removed the hat of Williams’s mother-in-law and flashed one guest’s underwear to the TV cameras. Wrapped warmly against the gusts, Enid and Charlotte Kendrick from South Yorkshire said they were “so excited” to have won some of the 1,200 tickets offered to members of the public to watch the bridal party from inside the grounds of Windsor Castle, and to have spotted Jimmy Carr and Richard Bacon among the guests.“We’re here just for the love of royalty,” said Charlotte Kendrick, who works as a nurse in Leeds and remembers the royal family’s special tea party in 1981 – when Eugenie’s uncle Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer – with her father taking photographs of the event from the television. “I just love the history. I’m a big Tudor fan,” she said.Abby Osgood and Louise Blundell, from Windsor, had brought their children, who were chomping through commemorative chocolate coins and playing computer games on their phones while wrapping their coats around their ears. Why were they such royal fans? “They keep the town nice,” said Osgood. “Without the castle, the town probably wouldn’t be as nice as it is.”Blundell said: “For me, after Harry and Meghan’s wedding, they are changing with the times and they are trying to keep it real.”They had no doubt the couple would be happy together. Osgood said: “Now they are allowed to marry for happiness rather than a certain type or a certain breed. The royal family have learned their lesson. You need to marry someone who makes you happy in the long run.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceba4ebe64f7634e4b304f2ccc97b66f69eac414/0_76_3234_1940/master/3234.jpg?width=500\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1fed1fe2be3930ca2e0fad496391e07d 1000w","title":"brexit theresa may no 10 indefinite customs union eu ireland backstop","story":"Downing Street spokeswoman tries to ease cabinet Brexiters’ concerns over Irish backstopDowning Street has insisted the government will not sign up to any deal with the EU that would keep the UK in a customs union indefinitely, as the prime minister tries to assuage concerns in her cabinet.British negotiators in Brussels are thought to be preparing to sign up to a draft of the backstop for Northern Ireland – aimed at preventing a hard border – that could see the whole of the UK effectively inside the customs union.The EU27 have long signalled they will not accept any end date for the backstop being inserted into the legally binding text of the withdrawal agreement.But Theresa May hopes to convince sceptical ministers, several of whom expressed concern about the idea at an informal meeting in No 10 on Thursday, that the backstop will never need to be invoked.The prime minister’s spokeswoman told journalists on Friday morning: “The prime minister would never agree to a deal which would trap the UK in a backstop permanently.”However, she declined to say whether any end date could be included in the agreement, the final details of which are being decided in Brussels over the weekend.“When we published our plans in June on a UK-wide customs backstop, we were absolutely clear that the arrangement would be temporary, and only in place until our future economic relationship is ready,” the spokeswoman said.“Our position is that this future economic relationship needs to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest.” This date is the end of the transition period negotiated by the UK as part of the orce deal with the EU.However, her remarks appeared to contradict comments from the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who is in Bali for the International Monetary Fund and G20 summits.Asked whether the UK could stay indefinitely in a customs union, Hammond said: “We’re not going to remain in anything indefinitely, we’re very clear this has to be temporary.Speaking in the House of Commons earlier this week, the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, said any backstop must be “temporary, limited and finite”.Brexit-supporting ministers are focusing on which mechanism will be used to ascertain whether the backstop needs to be invoked, and when it will come to an end.They fear the arrangement could end up becoming Britain’s permanent economic relationship with the EU – despite the fact that government policy is to leave the customs union – as it would limit the UK’s ability to strike future trade deals with non-EU economies.May hopes British negotiators can reach an agreement over the weekend, which she can discuss with the cabinet on Tuesday. Her spokeswoman said the meeting on Thursday was one of a number held with groups of key ministers.Downing Street also announced a further 29 no-deal notices would be published on Friday afternoon, setting out what businesses and consumers should do in the event of there being no agreement by 29 March 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29bb64763a2838b5badaf4dd6eef5a76d62d291a/0_231_6000_3604/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e882347b21d303a2538fef35bbbbe29f","title":"politics live readers edition friday 12 october","story":"A forum where readers can discuss today’s politics and share links to breaking news and to the most interesting politics stories, blogs and tweets on the web We’re not writing our usual blog today but here, as an alternative, is the Politics Live readers’ edition.

It was a good feeling.”Again sporting the No 95 shirt – a reference to his world record time over 100m – and playing up front, Bolt started a match for the first time, following on from his 20-minute cameo off the bench for the Mariners over a month ago.Having worked hard on his fitness since that debut on the Central Coast, the 32-year-old was able to last the majority of the game, but there remains much room for improvement in his general play before he can contemplate winning an A-League contract.He struggled to find his touch in the first half, but marginally improved in the second. His first goal, though, indicated some promise as he displayed strength to shrug off one defender before showing poise in front of goal to finish with a low left-footed shot. The second was a tap into an open goal after Macarthur’s goalkeeper and defender had taken each other out.The decision to withdraw him with 15 minutes remaining – with the prospect of a hat-trick tantalisingly close – was met with predictable boos and he departed to a standing ovation.“I think I’ve improved in every area,” Bolt said. “I think my touch is that little bit better my vision needs to improve a little bit more. I think my running off the ball is where I’ve improved most.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69336e48417fca25675b5eb9c4463840e488d256/0_792_5454_3274/master/5454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e806da0876aa0c88ed8494195d9f9736","title":"battersea arts centre seeks new artistic director to succeed david jubb","story":"Jubb, who has spent 15 years in the role, is to leave the arts centre that has fully reopened after its fire three years agoBattersea Arts Centre, the vibrant London venue that recently fully reopened after a devastating 2015 fire, is searching for a new artistic director and CEO. After 15 years in the joint role, David Jubb has announced that he is to step down in April or, in his words, “bugger off and let someone else have a go”.Jubb, who is “heading off to grow children and vegetables”, arrived at BAC as a development producer in 1999. He has been the artistic director and CEO since 2004. His collaborative “scratch” method of working – where everyone has a say in developing new ideas – was used not just on BAC’s productions but also on the renovation of the Grade II*-listed building after the fire.Artists championed and nurtured during Jubb’s time at the venue have included 1927, Kate Tempest, Little Bulb, Inua Ellams, Jess Thom aka Touretteshero and Bryony Kimmings, whose show I’m a Phoenix, Bitch opened this week to rave reviews as part of BAC’s Phoenix season. One of the theatre’s greatest hits was 2007’s The Masque of the Red Death, an immersive experience inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and created by the Punchdrunk company. The gothic adventure invited audiences to roam the building in cloaks and masks, and featured a walk-on part for the theatre’s cat, Pluto. It had a seven-month sellout run and was seen by more than 40,000 people.BAC’s productions have reached wider audiences in recent years thanks to their strand of BBC programming, Performance Live, which has included television broadcasts of theatre shows by Thom and Tempest and companies including Common Wealth and Gecko. During Jubb’s time at BAC the centre has also merged with Wandsworth Museum to create the new BAC Moving Museum.Jubb described BAC as “one of those places where people’s lives often begin again. They have an experience they meet someone or a community of people they discover a new passion. I think it’s why the organisation and the building are held with such affection. All great cultural centres are places of transformation – it is why they are such important institutions in our communities because they enable us to imagine a different future. I think BAC has always been one of the very best. It has been a massive privilege.”Michael Day, chair of the BAC board, said Jubb had “moved minds and hearts, always collaboratively and with humility and grace. In the aftermath of the fire, he showed us a future to believe in and worked tirelessly to bring everyone’s efforts together.”Jubb announced that in the months leading up to his departure he would write about about his experiences to “pass stuff forward to a younger generation of better artistic directors in Battersea and beyond”. In his first blog, he wrote that “an artistic director’s job is to help other people make things happen” and made a point of name-checking those colleagues who had delivered landmark projects during his 15 years.Artistic associate Shelley Hastings, who has worked at BAC since 2004, and associate artistic director Sarah Golding, who has been there since 1999, will also leave in 2019.The deadline for applications for the new artistic director and CEO is 26 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecad0d38c273a7e26b35550f9abee42a17afcfb5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd7d81650679ac6ed4b6aac595361b8a","title":"big tech v democracy chips with everything podcast","story":"Is the brave new digital world affecting our politics?

Jamie Bartlett joins Jordan Erica Webber to discussThere are plenty of ways to consider the power the Silicon Valley giants have: their financial power, the compulsive hold they have on consumers, the sheer volume of users and the data that comes along with them. One area in which this power has come under particular scrutiny recently is in the influence big tech has on elections worldwide. To discuss the growth in tribalism and explain the age of “Tinder politics”, Jordan Erica Webber speaks to author and tech blogger Jamie Bartlett, whose book The People Vs Tech explores the “bitter conflict” between technology and democracy.

Is the ‘curse of Strictly’ more about moralistic BBC bashing?It all started with a snog. Since shots of Strictly Come Dancing contestant Seann Walsh’s drunken kiss with dance partner Katya Jones appeared on the front page of the Sun on Sunday, the story has been played out in the red-tops. Today, the pair have made front pages of the Sun, the Mirror and Daily Mail. Their crime? Not apologising enough for said snog when they appeared on the Strictly spin-off It Takes Two to apologise for their actions.It is not surprising the duo have been pilloried by the press. The popular press love stories about the relationship-ending “curse of Strictly”, whose victims include rugby player Ben Cohen (who left his wife and now has a child with his dance partner Kristina Rihanoff) Rachel Riley (who orced her husband after appearing on the show in 2013 and is now with her partner Pasha Kovalev) and actor Georgia May Foote (who separated from her boyfriend before going on to date her dance partner Giovanni Pernice).We do not know what went on in Walsh’s relationship with his ex-girlfriend, the actor Rebecca Humphries. She did, however, write an extraordinarily brave and articulate statement that she posted on Twitter (note: she did not sell her story to the press, despite being offered money for doing so). In it, she claimed that during their relationship he had “aggressively and repeatedly” called her “psycho, nuts, mental” about her suspicions over his fidelity. Walsh has not addressed these claims.Yet the current coverage is not centred on this. Instead, it is a show trial for a snog.The dedicated column inches for forensic analysis of yesterday’s TV appearance included a front-page splash in the Sun under the banner “cheats face the music”. Over two further pages inside, the paper ran a full transcript of the interview, next to which a dedicated body-language expert was called in to explain that Walsh was not sincere because he “rubbed his nose” which is a “cut-off gesture”. Elsewhere, unnamed friends of Jones were quoted as saying the “Strictly snogger” keeps her husband “under the thumb”.The Mirror, meanwhile, went with the front-page headline “sorry excuse” and an inside page featuring a paparazzi picture of Jones’s husband Neil out walking his dog. The Daily Mail went with “Cha-cha cheat’s weasel apology”.While the judges have said that the incident will not affect the pair’s scores on Saturday night, and that they will be judged solely on their Charleston, viewers are expected to deliver them a sequinned blow on Saturday night in the public vote.Why do the papers care so much about a kiss? Perhaps it is in part because licence-fee-payers often feel as if they own the BBC.But the reason is also because family show Strictly is the embodiment of the BBC’s commitment to “inform, educate and entertain”. The fact that Jones is a married woman also sparks moral outrage. If the papers see the BBC as gatekeepers of the nation’s moral values, then any transgression by its stars will be seen as public property. Even if, at the moment, all that is in the public domain is a quick snog in the dark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab21018f36390bc4cd093736b6c80a4913fefe3/229_88_3137_1883/master/3137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=511224f4cb999f6fdfef84fbe23c3b0c","title":"how tv covered princess eugenie royal wedding this morning bbc","story":"The BBC preferred to show A1: Britain’s Longest Road, but ITV pulled out all the stops, or at least gave over a portion of This Morning to cover itRemember the last royal wedding? Glorious, wasn’t it? A moment of perfect choreography, offering us sunshine, tradition, celebrity and a demonstration of the purity of love. For just a moment, it managed to heal a troubled nation. “We should do this again soon!” people cooed at the time, awed by an overwhelming spirit of unbridled optimism.Well, guess what? We just did it again. In a note-for-note recreation of Harry and Meghan’s nuptials, Princess Thingy just got married to some bloke in Windsor Castle and … it probably isn’t a great idea to draw too many comparisons.Especially when it comes to media coverage. Harry and Meghan’s wedding was unavoidable, splayed out live across multiple channels simultaneously for hours on end. This one, though? Confined to ITV only. Worse, it didn’t even warrant its own slot, instead being folded into an episode of This Morning. Even worse than that, it was an episode of This Morning presented by substitute hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. That’s how second-rate this wedding was they couldn’t even rouse Philip Schofield for it.Why ITV? Perhaps it was because the other channels had their own pressing issues to deal with. As Princess Eugenie walked up the aisle, BBC One – which reportedly rejected Prince Andrew’s specific request to broadcast the ceremony – were showing Homes Under the Hammer followed by A1: Britain’s Longest Road. Why give that double bill up for something as trivial as a royal wedding?Still, this was ITV’s chance to show that it could equal the reverent displays of experts and Dimblebys that the BBC usually flings at occasions like this. And it’s fair to say that it had a good crack. Reporters were flung around Windsor to describe the atmosphere. This Morning’s theme tune was played by a string quartet and timpani. And the hosts? Well, again, maybe let’s not dwell on that either.“It is blowy,” Holmes sighed by way of introduction, as a camera listlessly scanned around a crowd of about six well-wishers. “It’s not the same as Meghan and Harry,” he added a moment later, more in resignation than sadness. Then Ruth mispronounced Eugenie’s name and they went to a Matalan commercial.But let’s not get too downhearted. The last wedding seamlessly managed to blur the line between royalty and celebrity, so surely at the very least we would have some famous faces to spot in the chapel. However, what we got was a relatively upscale Celebrity Come Dine With Me lineup. There was Demi Moore, dressed as the mistress who turns up 10 minutes late to a married man’s funeral. There was Liv Tyler (“From Armageddon,” said Holmes, helpfully). And there was …“The top of Kate Moss’s head, there,” shrugged Holmes as the cameras flailed around looking for someone – anyone – to get excited about. It lingered on a young woman for a moment. “I don’t know who that is,” sniffed Ruth. A nation – or at least the fraction of the percentage of the nation who didn’t have anything better to do – nodded in agreement.This Morning quite sensibly chose not to summon too many royal experts, possibly because they would have all said: “This makes absolutely no difference to anything.” Instead, a huge chunk of the show was dedicated to slightly desperate justifications of the wedding itself. At one point, a panel of guests took turns to rationalise the decision to televise a wedding of a woman whose name nobody – not even the self-styled “world’s most biggest monarchist”, previously interviewed – can pronounce.“Remember that she is a blood princess,” one said. “She’s ninth in line to the throne, and Harry is only sixth, so there’s not a lot of difference,” panted another. “It’s taking place at St George’s chapel, and St George is our patron saint,” offered a third, instantly transforming into the human equivalent of the ¯\\_(ツ)_¯ emoticon.As the royal family spattered in – driving straight up to the chapel’s entrance rather than strolling in like proles – the hosts were forced to share scraps of thin gruel. Lots of time was dedicated to the sight of Prince William briefly holding his wife’s hand. A child was blown over by the wind, and everyone lost their minds with excitement. The groom, Jack Brooksbank, arrived in a car, shooting past the temporary studio on the way in. “He promised us a wave,” growled Holmes, craning his neck. “He lied. he lied.”And then Eugenie turned up, and Brooksbank grinned in delight, and everyone looked so happy and nervous and, fine, it worked, OK? Weddings are great. It’s hard to be cynical at a wedding. As Jack awkwardly played with his hands and Beatrice threw everything into her slightly odd Great Gatsby reading, it was hard not to think the same thing that everyone thought all the way back in May. Maybe we really should do this again soon.The wedding ended. As Mr and Mrs Brooksbank entered their carriage to leave, Ruth murmured: “They promised us a wave” to the viewers. But there was no wave. Maybe next time, guys. Maybe next time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark one hundred years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world. Thirty nations had declared war between 1914 and 1918. Many countries along with Great Britain sided with the allies, including France, Italy, Russia, and the United States.

The Bavarian face of Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is on the campaign trail, but she can afford to take time for a coffee break. Polls for Sunday’s regional election in Germany’s wealthy southern state predict the far-right party will comfortably enter Bavaria’s parliament for the first time, and help deny the once dominant Christian Social Union (CSU) its majority for only the second time since 1966.“Fundamentally, people in Deggendorf and across Bavaria are doing really well,” says the town’s mayor, Christian Moser of the CSU, the sister party to Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union. “But the AfD are playing with people’s feelings. Anyone can make people nervous with the issue of security. We report the facts, but then they say the facts are false. But those are the facts. I can’t change people’s emotions.”It is on the issue of immigration that emotions continue to run high. In Deggendorf, Ebner-Steiner and the AfD have fuelled simmering resentment over a nearby reception centre housing up to 1,500 asylum seekers. While police say the new arrivals have made no difference to the local crime rate, the AfD candidate insists attacks on women are going unreported. Opponents say it is the kind of fearmongering that is difficult to disprove.Not to be outdone in tough talk, the Bavarian premier, Markus Söder of the CSU, this summer launched a state border force and granted police far-reaching surveillance powers. He also introduced a requirement for government buildings to display crucifixes in an attempt to win back Christian supporters. But if polls prove correct, the efforts of Söder and his fellow CSU strongman, the party leader, Horst Seehofer, have spectacularly backfired.“Seehofer and Söder have driven voters away with their right-leaning course and their anti-Merkel politics,” says Manfred Güllner, the head of the German polling agency Forsa. “The CSU was once one of the most successful major parties in Europe ning the left, centre and the right. But now it has lost its power to unite.”Core CSU supporters are turning away in droves, says Güllner, finding centre-right alternatives in the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and regional Free Voters. With the Social Democrats (SPD) equally tainted by repeated government crises in Berlin, the Bavarian Greens are free to challenge from the left.Ninety miles from Deggendorf, Georg Nitsche is handing out snacks and drinks from a green bike trailer to a group of volunteers on a Munich street corner. This unseasonably warm night will be Nitsche’s last campaigning door-to-door for the Greens before Sunday’s vote.“The mood across Bavaria has shifted towards the Greens,” says Nitsche, 73, a retired manager who has volunteered for the party during the past three campaigns. “Five years ago, knocking on doors was a very difficult business. Now, people have nothing against saying they’re voting Green.”Nitsche puts the surge partly down to the Greens’ young and charismatic leading candidates, Katharina Schulze and Ludwig Hartmann, both of whom have often joined him in person to canvass in Munich. But, he adds, it does not hurt that the other parties seem intent on tearing themselves apart.“The other parties are doing everything they can to help us,” says Nitsche, in between climbing stairwells in blocks of flats in his bid to persuade undecided voters in Munich’s student-heavy Schwabing district. “They’ve been constantly making mistakes for months now.”“The CSU has alienated a lot of voters by fishing for votes on the right,” agrees Nitsche’s fellow campaigner Maria Wissmiller, a spokesperson for the Greens’ Munich office. “They misunderstood. Bavarians might be conservative, but they aren’t far right.”And it seems that miscalculation will cost the CSU on Sunday. What remains to seen is how badly. The result will be watched carefully in Berlin. If the CSU implodes, the aftershocks could further destabilise Merkel’s government, and spell the political end of Söder and Seehofer.For all the dire predictions, Moser, the Deggendorf mayor, insists this is not the end of the CSU’s dominance in Bavaria, more a blip caused by national instability. He is hoping the shock will force his party to take note of the signal voters are about to send them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2ccd29a21a4ca78e255da713fcd8ba3ac16879e/0_150_6360_3816/master/6360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3c9126be4bc9d21d876456673d2c583","title":"italy matteo salvini little ethnic shops foreigners","story":"Minister calls late-night stores mostly run by foreigners ‘meeting place for drug deals’Italy’s far-right interior minister has come under fire for a proposal that would force what he calls “little ethnic shops” to close by 9pm.Matteo Salvini added the measure to his immigrant-targeting security decree, arguing late-night grocery stores, mostly run by foreigners, are “a meeting place for drug deals and people who raise hell”.He claimed the initiative was not specifically aimed at foreigners and was merely a way to “limit the abuses of certain shops”.Thousands of grocery stores across Italy are run by immigrants, mainly people from Bangladesh and India, many of whom bought premises for a low price during the financial crisis.Mauro Bussoni, the general secretary of Confesercenti, a retail association, said: “You can’t make a law that discriminates some entrepreneurs over others.“Those who have a commercial activity have rights and duties: the duty to respect rules and the right to remain open, whether the activity is managed by a foreigner or an Italian.”Carlo Rienzi, the president of Codacons, a consumer association, said it was unfair to “generalise”, while noting shops that stayed open late were essential for people seeking “last-minute” purchases. But he agreed there should be a clampdown on outlets that have “created disorder” or “degraded” historical town centres.Andrea Marcucci, a politician from the centre-left Democratic party, said imposing curfews was among the premises of “a regime”.If the proposal became law, an industry source said, it should also apply to Italian-owned outlets, including bars, while security measures must also extend to foreign business owners.“Some say that Italian people go into their shop late at night and try to extort money from them,” said the source. “But they are too afraid to report such incidents to the police.”Salvini’s security decree, unveiled in September, includes plans to abolish key protections for immigrants and make it easier for them to be deported.On Thursday, he reiterated a plan to hire 10,000 more police officers, an initiative funded by money that previously paid for migrant reception and integration projects. Parliament has until mid-November to debate and modify the decree before it becomes law.Salvini’s latest proposal comes after Luigi Di Maio, his coalition partner, said measures would be introduced by the end of the year to limit Sunday trading in an attempt to preserve family traditions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/009edc5eb9a94be620ef842723600022c20b1334/0_204_4336_2602/master/4336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b2ff501d0a197baef912028851f672b","title":"saudi arabia fii conference withdrawal jamal khashoggi","story":"World Bank joins CNN and Financial Times in pulling out of kingdom’s showpiece investment eventA high-profile investment summit in Riyadh later this month is rapidly becoming a fiasco as prominent businesses and media groups pulled out over Saudi Arabia’s alleged involvement in the disappearance and possible murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, said he would not be attending, soon after the Financial Times, CNN and CNBC withdrew as media sponsors.The world’s business elite were due to attend the Future Investment Initiative (FII), which begins in the Saudi capital on 23 October. However, some of the companies involved say they are withdrawing pending the outcome of investigations into Khashoggi’s disappearance, while others have pulled out unconditionally.Saudi Arabia’s ambitious Vision 2030 project – the brainchild of the kingdom’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – is strongly dependent on overseas investment, and the apparent shunning of the prestigious FII conference will be as disturbing to Saudi policymakers as the more distant threat of a US-imposed ban on arms sales.Jamal Khashoggi is one of the Arab world’s most prominent journalists and commentators. He is an outspoken critic of\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia\u0026nbspwho has dared to defy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler.While living in Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi was told to stop writing or posting on Twitter, where he has more than 1.6 million followers. He moved to the US more than a year ago, where he continued to comment on his country both in print and on television. He wrote columns for the Washington Post and\u0026nbspthe .His message struck a nuanced tone in the US, where he tried to acknowledge the reforms undertaken by Bin Salman while also highlighting the flaws.Khashoggi previously had close links with the Saudi royal family, including having served as a media aide to Prince Turki al-Faisal, when the latter was director general of the Saudi intelligence agency.He is also a former editor of the Saudi newspaper al-Watan and had worked with Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a grandson of the first Saudi king who was detained last year as part of what the authorities said was an anti-corruption campaign.The New York Times withdrew its sponsorship of the event on Wednesday, starting a domino effect of withdrawals from across the globe.In a short statement the Financial Times’ chief communications officer, Fiona McDonnell, said the newspaper would not be a partner of the conference while Khashoggi’s disappearance remained unexplained.Media figures to pull out of the conference include Ariana Huffington of the Huffington Post, the LA Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, and the CNBC anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin, who announced he would not attend before the broadcaster followed suit.The Viacom chief executive Bob Bakish and Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi have also confirmed they will not attend.“I’m very troubled by the reports to date about Jamal Khashoggi,” Khosrowshahi said in a statement late on Thursday. “We are following the situation closely, and unless a substantially different set of facts emerges, I won’t be attending the FII conference in Riyadh.” Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund is a major investor in Uber.Sir Richard Branson has halted discussions with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund about a planned $1bn investment in Virgin’s space companies. He has also suspended his participation in two advisory boards.Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, is listed as a speaker at the conference. Jihad Azour, head of the IMF’s Middle East department, would not say if she would attend. “Like most of the people here and everywhere we are waiting to have more information on this recent development,” Azour said.The Economist’s editor-in-chief, Zanny Minton Beddoes, has withdrawn from the FII. An editorial in the latest issue contained a rebuke to Bin Salman, stating: “His brutish handling of even mild critics is overshadowing more admirable policies, which include curbing the religious police, letting women drive and encouraging them to work.“As his regime starts to resemble an Arab nationalist dictatorship – socially liberal but centralised, paranoid and built on fear – his promise of a new, tolerant Saudi Arabia is receding.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c69f7a6f449c2b6420e6039ce5e310188f1c790/142_478_2484_1491/master/2484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=709bf272292f8cdc2ab252b135a91353","title":"teens tiaras quinceanera celebrations cuba havana diana markosian in pictures","story":"The quinceañera, the 15th birthday rite of passage into womanhood, is widely celebrated in Latino culture.

Photograph:  Nick BradshawThe President Michael D Higgins has criticised “the dark media” for “untruths” in relation to his presidency. He said people should take responsibility for their words and their language and denied he had supplemented the salary of a member of staff.Mr Higgins told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny Show the President’s allowance had been the same since 1998 and he had not changed it. “It is responsible for everything that happens in the Presidency.”However, he acknowledged changes should be made and he would do so if re-elected. “I want to do it properly and to take the time to think about it. I don’t think it should be personalised or politicised.”He said he would have no problem with an audit committee and thought it would be a good idea to bring out an annual report from the Arás. The President denied that he avoided media questions. “I’ve been answering questions since 1969. Michael D has been answering questions all his life, at every level of political engagement.”However, he said, as the incumbent, he was not in a position to “start running around” to address every rumour. He said there were constraints on him as President, but that he would deal with issues (of spending) at the proper time, to make things easier for whoever holds the office. It was absurd that there was a suggestion that he should make himself unpopular to give the other candidates a chance.Mr Higgins also said he had never booked a hotel as President, referring to the cost of a stay in a hotel in Switzerland. Mr Higgins said he had stayed in a tent in Somalia and in various types of accommodation with aid agencies in South America, but he never worried about where he would sleep. He defended his decision to run for a second term of office saying it was in response from encouragement from communities he had met over the years. “They asked me, I said ‘yes’.”He added: “No one asked me if I was standing for 14 years” in reference to a claim that people would not have voted for him if they thought he was going for a second term. “I’m sure some of them would have voted for me any way.”The President said if he met US president Donald Trump he would “observe the courtesies of the office” but would take the opportunity in private meetings to raise the issues of climate change, women’s rights and arms spending.Responding to claims by other candidates that they would use the office of President to promote Irish business abroad, Mr Higgins said he was already doing that and that the President could also promote the issue of climate change on an international stage as he had done in speeches in Paris and at the UN in New York.He also denied speculation about “the rate of attrition of staff” in the Arás, saying this was another example of the “dark media” and that it was common for staff to be promoted or to move forward their careers. “I am very happy with my staff.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3661332.1539346923!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"royal wedding celebrities join royalty as princess eugenie marries","story":"Queen Elizabeth\u0027s grand daughter Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank marry at St George\u0027s chapel, Windsor.

Photograph: PA Queen Elizabeth’s granddaughter Princess Eugenie married wine merchant Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on Friday in front of celebrities and Britain’s senior royals including Prince Harry and wife Meghan who wed at the same venue in May.Eugenie (28) younger daughter of the queen’s third child, Prince Andrew, and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, tied the knot with Brooksbank (32), in a traditional ceremony in the castle’s 15th century St George’s Chapel.It was the same setting as Harry and Meghan’s wedding in May, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as the couple are now known, were among the star-studded congregation.The 92-year-old queen and her husband Philip (97), who has retired from official engagements, were joined by other royals and celebrities including Hollywood stars Liv Tyler and Demi Moore, models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell and singer Ellie Goulding.Female guests had to cling on to their hats as a blustery wind threatened their wedding outfits and a page boy tripped on the stairs walking into the chapel.Eugenie’s dress, by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos of the London-based label Peter Pilotto, had a low back to reveal scars from surgery she underwent to correct scoliosis when she was 12.“It’s a lovely way to honour the people who looked after me and a way of standing up for young people who also go through this,” she told ITV’s This Morning ahead of the wedding.The couple, while showing clear signs on nerves, beamed happily during the hour-long service.“This is meant to be a family wedding,” Eugenie’s father Andrew said earlier.“There will be a few more people than most people have, there are a few more than Harry had, but that’s just the nature of Eugenie and Jack - they’ve got so many friends that they need a church of that size to fit them all in,” he told “This Morning” which broadcast the event live.Several hundred singing and cheering well-wishers gathered outside in Windsor in the shadow of the castle, far fewer than the thousands that crammed into the town for Harry’s wedding.“I’m a true royalist,” David Weeks (77) bedecked in a Union Jack suit and bowler hat, told Reuters. “I was here for the queen’s 90th birthday. I was here for Harry and Meghan’s wedding, I wouldn’t miss it, I love the atmosphere.”The ceremony was conducted by the Dean of Windsor David Conner, and Eugenie’s elder sister, Princess Beatrice, the maid of honour, read an extract from the F Scott Fitzgerald novel The Great Gatsby which the bride had read after meeting her future husband in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier in 2010.“One particular passage in which Jay Gatsby is described reminded her immediately of Jack,” Dean Conner said. “She decided she wanted eventually to let Jack know how much those words had brought him to mind.”One noticeable absentee was Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, the wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, as she was carrying out an engagement in Scotland.Princess Charlotte (3) daughter of Harry’s elder brother Prince William and his wife Kate, was a bridesmaid, and her brother, Prince George (5) a page boy.After the service, the couple took an open-top horse-drawn carriage tour of Windsor before a reception at the castle, hosted by the queen.Eugenie is a director at London’s Hauser \u0026amp Wirth art gallery, and Brooksbank owns a wine wholesale business and is European brand manager for Casamigos Tequila, which was co-founded by US actor George Clooney.Security around Windsor was tight, with airport-style security checks and large numbers of police. As Eugenie does not carry out official royal duties, republicans have said it is wrong that the estimated £2 million pounds (€2.28m) security bill will be paid by taxpayers. –Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3661286.1539342366!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pope reluctantly accepts resignation of cardinal donald wuerl","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA  November 2017 photograph of Cardinal Donald Wuerl, who has resigned as archbishop of Washington, DC. Photograph: SAUL LOEBAFPGetty ImagesPope Francis has accepted the resignation of Cardinal Donald Wuerl as archbishop of Washington, DC, the Vatican said on Friday, making him one of the most senior Catholic figures to step down in a worldwide sexual abuse crisis.Cardinal Wuerl (77), who was bishop of Pittsburgh between 1988 and 2006, has been under scrutiny over his handling of sexual abuse cases during that period. He keeps the title of cardinal.In a letter by the pope released in Washington, the pope indicated he accepted the resignation reluctantly and at Wuerl’s insistence. He asked Wuerl to stay on as administrator until another archbishop could be appointed.Cardinal Wuerl has been under fire since the release in August of a US grand jury report on sexual abuse found evidence that at least 1,000 people, mostly children, had been sexually abused by some 300 clergymen over the course of 70 years. The report covered six diocese in Pennsylvania, including Pittsburgh when it was led by Wuerl.He has also been accused of knowing about sexual misconduct by his predecessor in Washington, ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick.Last August, Cardinal Wuerl cancelled a trip to Dublin where he was to deliver the keynote address at a World Meeting of Families pastoral congress. His topic was “The Welfare of the Family is Decisive for the Future of the World”.Cardinal Wuerl has defended his overall record in Pittsburgh. He also has denied knowing that McCarrick, once one of the US church’s most prominent figures, had forced male adult seminarians to have sex with him years ago.In July McCarrick became the first cardinal in about 100 years to be stripped of his red hat and title of “eminence”.Francis ordered McCarrick to retire to a life of prayer and penitence after American church officials said as part of a separate investigation that allegations that McCarrick had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago were credible and substantiated. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000121320093_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq9ZgHWGWfvdgN-PUV7CBULV0zNzLfrznGRYECrXmb1BQ.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bristol mp calls slave traders statue removed city offends black","story":"His statue has enraged people who feel like his presence is disrespectful to black BristoliansA Bristol MP has called  for a slave trader\u0027s statue to be removed from the city because it offends black residents.Thangam Debbonaire, Labour MP for Bristol West, wants the memorial of Edward Colston to be taken down as she said the city “should not be honouring people who benefited from slavery”.Colston , who was born into a prosperous Bristol merchant\u0027s family in 1672 , made his fortune through capital trading in slaves, cloth, wine and sugar.His statue has enraged many locals who feel like his presence is disrespectful to black Bristolians who have to walk past it everyday.Speaking at a Black History Month event at Bristol’s City Hall, attended by Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, Mrs Debonnaire said: “Having statues of people who oppressed us is not a good thing to be saying to black people in this city.”Marti Burgess, Trustee at equality campaign group Black South West Network, also expressed how she feels when she walks past the memorial.She said: “I walk past it every day in my hometown and it looks like we are wanting to celebrate somebody who did what he did- and of someone of Jamaican descent, we shouldn’t memorialise someone who made money of the backs of enslaved Africans.”Thangam Debbonaire, Labour MP for Bristol West, wants the memorial of Edward Colston to be taken down The statue was put up in Bristol in 1895, several years after Colston’s death, in an attempt by the elites to find a common identity for Bristolians during a time of great labour unrest.But there have been mounting demands to alter the statue in order to educate people on the merchant’s links to slavery, as at present the memorial makes no mention of his notorious past.Bristol City Council, who administer statues in the city, had planned to add a second plaque to the statue before disagreement over the wording halted its progress.Countering Colston ,a campaign group who oppose the statue, have been advocating for it to be moved to a museum instead of remaining in its current position on Colston Avenue in the city centre.A spokesperson said: “Statues don’t teach history they commemorate heroes. We should take Colston down from his plinth, so that he is no longer symbolically elevated above the rest of us, and put the statue in an appropriate museum where it can be studied.”In April last year, Colston Hall announced it would ditch ties with the 17th Century slave trader\u0027s name.The music venue wants to get rid of the “toxic” name in a bid to more accurately  reflect its values as a “forward thinking” arts organisations.On the Colston Hall name change, Mrs Debbonaire said she was “really glad it\u0027s happening”.“I know it\u0027s controversial, but the world\u0027s not going to fall down because we\u0027re renaming some buildings,” she added.The Labour MP\u0027s plans have been met with opposition from Conservative councillors who believe the statue should remain in its place so that the history of Colston\u0027s actions are not erased.Claire Hiscott, a Bristol Conservative Councillor said:  “I think it should stay the way it is because we need to remember the complex history of Bristol and understand where we came from and then celebrate where we have moved forward. I do not want to eradicate the history from the city, but we want to learn from it.”Royal wedding live: Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank celebrate as newlyweds - latest updates\u0026#39A true, classic bride\u0026#39 -

My entire back, arms and head are badly bruised. I’m just so relieved that my daughter and grandmother are alright.As soon as Ms Simpson pulled her car over because of the heavy rain, she heard a loud bang and realised the back windows of her car, where her young child was sitting, had been destroyed by the hail.Ms Simpson and her child were taken to hospital for checks after the dramatic incident (Fiona SimpsonFacebook)It was so scary but there was no time to be afraid … It just all happened so fast,” she later told Australia’s ABC broadcaster. The quick-thinking mum leapt into the back seat to cover her daughter from the deluge.“I looked down and I could see she was screaming but I couldn’t even hear her, that’s how loud it was.”\u0026nbspOnce the worst of the storm had moved on she managed to drive her shredded car to a nearby house so she could call for an ambulance.The huge storm sweeping across Queensland has been supercharged by sucking in several tornadoes while it lashes the north-eastern Australian state.As well as large hailstones, strong winds reaching 60mph have caused widespread damage, bringing down trees and power lines. In some areas as much as 100mm of rain fell in less than 24 hours.There have also been incidents of flash flooding authorities said they had received more than 300 calls for helps, including one from a driver who was trapped by a fallen tree.Rescuers have been battling with chainsaws to cut through the splintered trees to reach those, especially vulnerable elderly people, cut off by the storm.Australia dismisses UN warning to quit coal or face climate disasterThe director of Queensland’s State Emergency Service, Brian Cox, said his volunteers had encountered a number of heart-wrenching scenes. “People are so upset with losing their roofs and property being damaged … it’s a very emotional time for them,” he told the Courier Mail newspaper.“It’s timely reminder that we are going into storm season these events do happen. We strongly recommend people have a plan.

There’s quite a few dead down there. They got slammed, or wet and cold, and died. We’ll have to go down and pick all of those up and compost them.”The furious winds lifted the farm’s sheds off the ground, leaving contorted sheet metal scattered across the fields along with broken solar panels. The damage bill was likely to be as high as $300,000 (£161,000), Ms Geri said.The president of Queensland Dairy Farmers, Brian Tessmann, said the storm also tore through his farm, lifting the roof of his home and dairy and sending his possessions swirling through the air. “It was bedlam from there, trying to hold doors shut, and water coming through the ceiling, and things flying through the air,” he told the ABC. “It was quite something.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She will remain in detention until the court delivers its written verdict in the coming days.“I think we have a good case,” said her lawyer Yotam Ben-Hillel. “The state’s argument and evidence was weak, but I’ve learned not to be optimistic.”The American graduate\u0026nbspstudent, whose father is Palestinian, arrived in Israel with a valid visa and was registered to study human rights at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University.But she was barred from entering the country and ordered deported, based on suspicions that she is an activist for the pro-Palestinian boycott movement.She has spent the week in a confined area with a bed infested with bedbugs, people who have been in contact with her told Al Jazeera.The Israeli authorities said that Ms Alqasem is not being held against her will and is free to leave the country. The country enacted a law last year banning entry for any foreigner who “knowingly issues a public call for boycotting Israel.”Ms Alqasem is a former president of the University of Florida chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. The group is a branch of the BDS movement calling for boycotts, estment and sanctions against Israel.Asher Fredman, a senior official in the Strategic Affairs Ministry, said that Ms Alqasem was being denied entry because of her past activities, not her opinions.“We have clear criteria,” he said. “We believe that Miss Alqasem meets those criteria based on her actions, and the actions of the organisation of which she was a senior leader over several years.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Russia has halted all crewed space flights following the failed launch of the Soyuz  MS-10 rocket (pictured).

Bavaria election 2018 polls: What time do polling stations open?MTU told employees in a letter: Populist slogans don\u0027t take our country forward, but rather targeted government action on the basis of our core values.Germany, and especially a strategically-orientated industry like ours, relies on stable political conditions.The letter was posted on the company\u0027s intranet and a copy of which was seen by Reuters.Company directors insisted they were not advising their employees which party to back but urged them to vote responsibly.

But this is the reality of trying to save up for a house.They work hard each month. They’d love to put something aside to save up for a home.But to live where there are good jobs, they have to spend so much on high rents that there’s nothing left over.So they can never save enough to break out of the cycle. No wonder they are frustrated.New figures show how bad things have got. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says four out of ten people in the  to -year-old age bracket couldn’t afford the mortgage on even the cheapest house in their area, eventhey had a deposit.The gap between prices and normal people’s earnings is just too big, because since  house prices in Britain have gone up more than in any other developed country.Expensive housing has meant that the proportion of young people on middle incomes who own their own home has collapsed: down from nearly two thirds  years ago, to just over a quarter today.We have to turn this round and restore home ownership.Many people feel they can’t get on and start a family until they have a nest of their own. Their lives are on hold.Politically it’s vital too. If young people don’t feel they’ve got a chance to get on in le, they are more likely to gamble and vote for extreme, disastrous politicians like Jeremy Corbyn.Even younger people who are earning decent wages feel squeezed, because they face a combination of high house prices and chunky repayments on their student loans.The Prime Minister is acutely aware of this. That’s why she’s set up a review of student fees, and moved to make housing her Number  priority other than Brexit.Hence her announcement of massive funding to build more affordable housing for people on lower incomes. But there’s much more to do.Building more homes for people to buy is a big part of the answer. Since  we have built only half as many houses as France each year, and so house prices have gone up twice as fast.Some people say building more means we must tear up the planning system and concrete over the countryside.But we know that approach won’t work. When Gordon Brown was PM we tried setting each area massive housing targets. All those targets built was resentment. We need a smarter approach to tackle the reasons people often oppose new housing.We build in the wrong places. Instead of tacking on new estates to existing towns and villages without enough new school places or parking places, let’s get back into the business of building planned new cities and towns.Let’s build upwards in our city centres with taller buildings, rather than just sprawling cities outwards.What drives people mad is seeing developers make massive windfall profits when they get planning permission, but then not sharing those benefits with local residents.Imagine instead,new houses being built next door always paid for people in neighbouring streets to get cheap homes for their children to buy. People would feel much better about development.Restoring the dream of home ownership isn’t just about building more houses though.We need to think about the balance of rented properties and home ownership. Over the last ten years we’ve built many new homes each year, but the number of homeowners fell. How come The reason is that the number of properties being snapped up by buy-to-let landlords has grown faster than we have built new ones.Don’t get me wrong. Landlords, who have themselves worked hard, weren’t doing anything wrong.Butwe want to get home ownership growing again we need to encourage savers to put their money into shares and into growing businesses rather than just bidding up the price of houses. The think tank Onward proposed this week that we should offer a tax break to landlords who sell their homes to their tenants.This “Chance to Buy” would be a bit like the Right to Buy Margaret Thatcher introduced for council tenants. It could be paid for by tax changes which would discourage people from buying up new buy-to-let properties.So fewer landlords, more homeowners.Young people just want the same chances previous generations enjoyed. So let’s build more by building smarter, and give a new generation the chance to buy a home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rest will be Brits who could claim more for child benefit, housing benefit, income support, jobseekers allowance or ESA.Those who are already on Universal Credit at the moment are only new claimants and are unlikely to be affected - but those who are claiming benefits on the old system and who will be rolled over soon could get a welcome boost.Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told The Sun Online: Universal Credit is a benefit system designed for the st century, replacing the old out-of-date legacy system.UC will provide more support to the most vulnerable, and helps people claim their right entitlement, helping those who may not be getting the right amount.As people move onto Universal Credit from the old system, there are around £.bn of unclaimed benefits that people will be able to access – benefiting around , people.Dave Finch, Senior Fellow at the Resolution Foundation, said: One of the key remaining advantages of Universal Credit is that by simplying the benefit system it should help families to claim all of what they’re entitled to.This would offer a welcome income boost to over half a million families, but it risks being undermined by problems where – such as the large cuts made to support for working families.The government needs to both highlight the remaining benefits of Universal Credit, and do more to deal with the signicant problems it still faces.Youll have to re-apply for your benefits again, and fill out the relevant paperwork.But after giving the DWP all your information, the new system should automatically pick up whether you are entitled to more benefits.This could include jobseekers allowance, ESA, income support, tax credits, housing benefit or child benefits.Universal Credit will roll all of these into one new monthly payment.Its thought that around , Brits will benefit from it.Roll-out of the Governments flagship welfare reform programme is expected to take place in  job centres.By , it is expected there will be a full roll out across the UK.For information about whether you can claim, visit Citizens Advice.The news will be a boost for some of the millions of people who are set to migrate over to the new system, which aims to roll several benefits into one monthly payment.But the flagship programme has been beset with issues so far, even though only a small number of the population are on it.The system has been plagued with delays and problems, and hundreds of complaints that benefits have been slashed by hundreds of pounds a month.Some were missing out on hundreds due to when their pay date fell.And one family of a boy battling cancer were so poor on Universal Credit they were forced to eat his leftover hospital food.The Sun Online revealed earlier this year the case of a disabled man born with  holes in his heart who has been denied benefits on Universal Credit - and told to get a job.Ministers have insisted that no one will be worse off going on to the new systemtheir situation doesnt change.But they will only be able to access transitional protection payments for a certain amount of time under Universal Credit.The former Tory leader attacked the Governments key welfare reforms today, saying it would lead to deep political trouble.Sir John said he was worried about how fast it was being rolled out and the way thousands were set to be worse off.He told the BBC: I am saying thatyou have people who have that degree of loss, that is not something that the majority of the British population would think of as fair.Andpeople think you have to remove yourself from fairness, then you are in deep political trouble.The poll tax - introduced in the s - proved very unpopular and led to riots and rebellions, and the fall of Margaret Thatchers government.IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover it, here are your options:Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Yesterday ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown made a huge intervention in the debate, calling on ministers to halt the rollout.He said that Universal Credit was forcing more kids into poverty, and demanded they rethink the entire system.Ministers say the new programme will make work pay, and will encourage more Brits into work.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I still can’t believe it.In March last year, a jihadi went on a rampage in Westminster.Then he smashed into the perimeter fence and entered New Palace Yard, a few dozen feet away from where our politicians were gathered.Armed with a kne, he attacked anyone he saw. He murdered PC Keith Palmer.And now the thing that beggars belief. At that very moment, the acting commissioner of the politan Police, Craig Mackey, was leaving the scene in a car. He was inches away from Masood.He was only a few feet away when the Islamic terrorist was busy stabbing his colleague, PC Palmer.He watched the stabbing take place. And what did he do  He drove off, sharpish, having locked the windows of his car.He told an inquest into the murder: “I was in shirt-sleeves with no radio. We had no protective equipment.“The way the male came in, he was clearly a threat.“The attacker had one of those looks where,they get you in that look, they would be after you.”So he skedaddled as fast as he could, actually driving right past Masood.It has a Monty Python ring to it.“When danger reared its ugly head, Sir Craig bravely turned and fled . . .”How, I wondered, could he possibly do that  I thought one of the requirements for being a copper was a certain bravery and, you know, a vague interest in apprehending criminals Also, Masood seemed a bit nasty. He had “one of those looks”.No s**t, Sherlock. This is cowardice and, to my mind, a gross dereliction of duty.At the very least, he could have opened the car door to distract the attacker.Nope, not Sir Craig. If he’d done something — anything — poor PC Palmer might be alive today. Various senior ex-coppers have called for Mackey to be booted out, right now. and stripped of his knighthood.Incidentally, he was bunged the knighthood in this year’s New Year’s honours, partly for hugely reducing the number of stop-and-searches in London. That’s what the lefties wanted at the time.They bleated that stop-and-search was racist. Craig was only too happy to oblige. Oh, the irony of it.It’s thought ending stop-and-search contributed to the jamboree of stabbings we have seen in London this year.You wonder how Mackey has lived with himself these last  months. And how he can possibly retain the respect of his less well-remunerated colleagues.But it tells you a lot about the way our police forces are run these days.Their political grandstanding on “hate-speech” issues.Their reluctance to engage in the dficult, nasty side of policing, such as stopping real villains going about their work.Resign, Sir Craig.At least salvage a little bit of dignity by doing that.She turns them all down because they were too small. Or not in a nice area. We even offered to bung her £, for a deposit on a home.Now the woman has sued her local authority for infringing her human rights.Listen, love, they’re not half as infringed as they would beI had my way.You’d be dropped from a plane into Aleppo . . . and you’d have to crowd-fund the parachute. WIND turbines are a blight on the landscape.They deliver very little energy for their monstrous size. And they act as a kind of huge Moulinex blender for all kinds of wild birds.Now the United Nations’ World Health Organisation has discovered still more flaws in these ludicrous contraptions. They can also cause heart problems, high blood pressure and tinnitus in humans.But because they are beloved by the gobby Green lobby, we’re going to have loads more of them.Marching across the country.

The moron hordes descended upon Kelly, pictured.They demanded he “educate himself”, saying Churchill was a racist, imperialist murderer. The usual rot.Kelly was forced to apologise, though he should never have done so. Sure, Churchill possessed a few views which today we would find a little, er, problematic.

Yet just four years ago the Shadow Chancellor rejoiced that the once-rich South American country was now experiencing “socialism in action”.The warning signs of collapse were already there. Essentials were running out. Renationalisations, price controls, the trampling on the rule of law and lack of private investment saw to that.McDonnell ignored it all. And he won’t care one bitwe suffer such horrors too.

It is also used as a solvent in a number of pharmaceuticals.The findings, published in the American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular, show e-cigs and refills are not well regulated - and their long-term effects on health are unknown.Researchers compared several groups of mice that received whole-body exposure to ying chemical combinations four times each day, with every session separated by -minute smoke-free intervals.Dr Glynos from the University of Athens, said: Electronic cigarettes are advertised as a less harmful nicotine delivery system or as a new smoking cessation tool. Our findings suggest that exposure to e-cig vapour can trigger inflammatory responses and adversely affect respiratory system mechanics.Dr Glynos added: We conclude that both e-cig vaping and conventional cigarette smoking negatively impact lung biology.His findings follow a British study earlier this year that also suggested vaping is more harmful than previously thought.University of Birmingham scientists extracted cells from lung samples provided by healthy non-smokers and exposed them to e-cig fluid, condensed vapour or nothing for  hours. Exposure to the vapour increased cell death and the production of inflammatory chemicals.Public Health England says e-cigs are  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes. And they suggest smokers should consider switching to vaping in a bid to help them quit. But critics warn vaping may cause lung disease, keep people hooked on nicotine, or act as route in to smoking for kids.Some .million Brits smoke and .million use e-cigs, Office for National Statistics figures show. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then out of nowhere she called me a gay fairy.”Paul called customer services after leaving the branch but says he was left feeling shocked and embarrassed in his car.Paul said: “I was embarrassed, and I felt a little belittled as I was put in the corner to wait by a teller that didn’t work.“I was a bit shaken but there’s nothing you can about it, other than trying to change the way people treat other people.”After making the initial complaint, he says he then received a call three days later from the customer relations team originally offering him £ before upping it to £.Paul, who now lives with his mum in Romford, said: “What shocked me the most and what hurt the most is that when I’d spoken to customer services on the phone, I didn’t get any apology.“When she said she’d offer me the ‘benefit of the doubt’ and give me £ I couldn’t believe it.“They probably thought the £ would shut down the case, it was insulting.“I’d rather they send her on a training course so she can learn how to behave, than sending me the money.“Then she said that with the information she had £ would be more appropriate, just like that. I hit the roof.“I asked her whether she should have done an investigation before speaking to me instead she offered compensation without having spoken to anyone in the branch.”Paul, who has been banking with Lloyds since he was a teenager, said: “A lot of the staff at Lloyds are very good and I wouldn’t want to tarnish their reputations.“But I was taken back, and it caught me off guard that someone would be homophobic at a national bank in this day and age.A Lloyds Bank spokesperson said: “We have taken Mr Whitbread’s claims extremely seriously and have undertaken a full investigation into the allegations that have been made.While we recognise some of the service we provided Mr Whitbread did not meet the high standards we aim for when he visited our branch, we have not been able to find evidence to support all aspects of his complaint.“In respect of the nature of the language Mr Whitbread claims was used, this is something we would always treat with the utmost importance.As an organisation we are extremely proud of our position as a leader for LGBT+ equality.

I’ve looked at them closely for years, inidually, every single one of them.“To come to a place where they are etched in stone is emotional but also very positive.”Rob has hand-stitched shrouds on to in plastic men to mark the unidentied Commonwealth soldiers who fell at the Somme.He hopes to have finished all , by November  — Armistice Day, a century after the end of the war.Each one will then be laid out side by side in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, covering almost an acre of grass.Rob, from Watchet, Somerset, said: “Throughout the summer we have shown some of them in cities from Exeter to Belfast, and everywhere people have been moved to tears. But the emotion they feel, the tears they have already shed and will shed at the Olympic Park, is a positive thing.“The men I have lived with for the last five years will never be forgotten.”With four weeks to go, Rob still has , to complete and is in a race against time to finish what TV historian Dan Snow described as “the most powerful depiction of the losses in World War One that I have ever come across”.Rob said: “It sounds a lot butI have to work all day and all night, I will get them all there for the ­Olympic Park. Emotion takes its toll but it’s very dficult to say I’m ­feeling tired or don’t want to do this any more because, however challenging my task, it’s nothing to what these young men had to go through.”Rob’s tribute, called Shrouds Of The Somme, is raising money for Armed Forces’ charity SSAFA and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission .For the th anniversary of Armistice Day – ­November ,  – we will be ­publishing The Sun First World War Centenary Roll Of Honour.We want you to tell us about ­members of your family who took part.

Rob said: “Some days you have  or so deaths and then, on July , , you see it leap to ,.“Under no circumstances can we forget what those men did. They stepped out, they died. They were that brave. Very few got to fire a shot.”Following a car crash which left him no longer able to work as a carpenter, Rob began his remarkable odyssey by making , shrouds in tribute to those killed in the Somme on that horric first day.Glyn Prysor, chief historian at CWGC, said: “Rob’s work confronts you with the reality of what that war really meant.“Each of the names on this ­memorial is not just a le lost.

I firmly believe they should just not be on their phones in school and so I strongly support schools that ban phones.”But he refused the temptation to implement an official ban like has happened in France.He went on: “When people ask meI am going to follow the French model and impose a national ban I say no.“Headteachers know best how to run their schools and how to achieve the objectives they want without unintended consequences. We have given teachers the power to confiscate phones where necessary and to investigate cyberbullying that goes on beyond the school gates.”Quizzed further on whether children are being “weaned” on mobile devices, he added: “Dferent parents do dferent things.

And we need to make sure that in all cases it is to empower parents.”The Education Secretary also blasted Labour plans to scrap the free schools schemethey won power.He said Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to impose a “common rulebook” on all schools was “dangerous control freakery” and would put politicians in charge of schools instead of teachers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The first thing in my mind was obviously that he was going to expose himself.I dont know why he couldnt have gone in the bush or something. He just wanted to do it up my truck.The funniest bit for me is that hes probably someones grandad. Thats really strange. I cant imagine my grandad doing that.The video, posted online, prompted other lorry and bus drivers to share their similar experiences with Jack.Jack said: Ive never had something happen like that before.Theres a couple of other drivers who have told me theyve had people do it in the layby or a traffic jam but thats the most Ive ever heard of it to be honest.All I get is just laughter.

and we cant be tied to the EU indefinitely.This is becauseBritain stays in the EUs customs union forever, it cant do trade deals with other countries around the world.Mrs May has just days left to get an arrangement with the EU and her top team before a crunch October summit with other leaders.A No source said last night: The PM’s commitment and need for a time limit remains.And this morning the PMs spokesperson added that the backstop must be temporary and that she wont agree a deal which traps the UK in a backstop indefinitely.Leaving the meeting last night, May loyalist Chief whip Julian Smith said: “The PM and the Government are conducting a complex negotiation that is going well and we should be backing the Prime Minister”.Also there was Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Business Secretary Greg Clark, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.But Brexiteers Andrea Leadsom, Commons Leader, and Esther McVey, Work and Pensions Secretary, were not at the meeting and are said to be firmly opposed to Mrs Mays plans.The PM has been warned that some will quitthe gives into the EUs hardline demands.Meanwhile the DUP are equally furious about plans to separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK in the backstop agreement.The PMs Northern Ireland allies are threatening to pull the plug on support for her Governmentthey say Northern Ireland should stay part of the EUs single market rules after we leave -no trade deal is signed.DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said that the party might have to heal wounds by changing the leader.He told Sky News that all  of the partys MPs could vote down the Budget later this month to pull the Government back into keeping its promises.That may lead to a dferent leader, he admitted.But thats not a question for us, were not members of the Conservative Party.He said his party wouldnt be bullied or bribed into supporting a deal that would see Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.But Tory MP Nick Boles fumed this morning: Conservative leaders are chosen by Conservative MPs and Conservative Party members. Not by MPs of any other party.And we respond no better to threats than proud Ulster men or women do.That would mean checks between Britain and Northern Ireland, something the DUP refuses to accept.The Sun revealed last night that Mrs May could be willing to hand over MORE money to the Unionist partythey accept the deal.MPs have threatened to torpedo the upcoming Budgetthey dont get their way too.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have choices.But Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said his words smacked of good old fashioned spin.It comes after the Office for Budget Responsibility warned yesterday of the consequences of No Deal - saying it would harm the pound and the economy.He said the EU Commission had been very engaged over the last ten days, raising hopes further that a deal can be signed at a crunch summit coming up next week.But Mr Hammond also raised the prospect that the Brexit backstop - which is currently in a period of crunch negotiation - will probably be needed after we leave the EU.He said: Were very clear this has to be a temporary period, but it is true that there needs to be a period - probably following the transition period that weve negotiated and before we enter into our long-term partnership - just because of the time it will take to implement the systems required.He vowed that Britain would not going to remain in anything indefinitely.A deal would be welcome news for the Chancellor, who is under pressure to find extra money to pay for the extra cash for the NHS that Mrs May promised earlier this year.And hes also facing grumblings from backbench Tory MPs to reverse cuts to the welfare budget.Yesterday DWP Secretary Esther McVey said for the first time that some people would be worse off after Universal Credit was rolled out next year.The troubled new system has already been plagued with problems since Brits started to move onto it, and its years behind schedule."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000306015839.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"poppi worthington no evidence dads laptop","story":"Paul Worthington, , viewed porn on the computer hours before the -month-olds death at home in Barrow-in-Furness in December .But cops did not seize the laptop at the time — one of a series of blunders in the botched investigation which has led to no prosecutions over tragic Poppis death.An inquest in January -

The Gento penguins could be seen waddling in tandem and swimming alongside and were so close it was decided to let them adopt. But before this they were given antenatal classes.This entailed the flightless birds being given a dummy egg to allow them to practice incubating and develop their parenting skills.And by all accounts they seem to be taking to the task like a penguin does to water. It appears that the pair are naturals, although older and more mature Sphen is more focused on incubating while Magic has taken on the task of warding off other birds from swiping their pebbles which they use for their nests.JUST like some humans, penguins form same sex relationships. The first mention of this was in  when explorer George Murray Levick spotted male birds coupling up at Cape Adare.Seemingly scandalised by the sight, the Edwardian scientist described the behaviour as depraved. More recently the behaviour has been observed in a number of zoos. In  Jumbs and Hurricane, two Humboldt penguins at Wingham Wildle Park in Kent became inseparable and became celebrities in their own right.They later successfully hatched and reared an egg given to them as surrogate parents after the mum abandoned it halfway through incubation.Last month a gay penguin couple “kidnapped” a baby last while its parents waddled off for a swim, according to a zookeeper claimed.Apparently the drama unfolded in a zoo in Denmark when the chick’s mum and dad were having their daily paddle.Animal keeper Sandie Hedegård Munck told Danish broadcaster DR the male penguin couple at Odense Zoo have been desperate to become parents.So, she claims when they saw the chick being “neglected” by its parents, they decided to intervene and snatch it in hope of adopting it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000440990949.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"marks and spencer hijab school uniform girls sale","story":"The companys social media pages have been flooded with messages regarding the black headscarf, which is on sale for just £ in their School Essentials section.MS say they are selling the hijab after a number of schools requested the option.But radio presenter Maajid Nawaz has criticised the move,saying it facilitates medievalism.He said: It’s their right to choose profit over values.

Other factors of concern to investors are the risk of a \"no-deal\" Brexit, signs of a possible clash between the EU and Italy over the latters refusal to set a responsible budget, and the US midterm elections.But the relationship between the US and China is the biggest concern.And, overlaying all that, is the inexorable rise of debt. The International Monetary Funds latest report reveals that global debt stood at tnat the end of , representing a % increase over the past decade.If other economies raise interest rates like the US - or even start to withdraw the fiscal stimuli put in place after the financial crisis - that raises the cost of servicing and ultimately repaying debt for a lot of borrowers. :: Was some kind of sell-off inevitable Absolutely. Another very important factor to bear in mind is that we are now at the end of a very long running cycle in which stocks have risen inexorably upwards.The current bull market in equities is now in its th year in both the US and Europe. At some stage, a correction was inevitable. It is no surprise whatsoever that the most violent falls in stocks in recent days have been in stocks that have enjoyed the most spectacular gains, most notably US tech stocks like Apple and Amazon, but also the likes of Fever-Tree Drinks in the UK, which has lost a third of its market value during the last week."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/10/2048x1152/skynews-princess-eugenie-jack-brooksbank_4451097.jpg?20181012124535 ","title":"royal wedding eugenie beams as she marries jack brooksbank","story":"The ninth in the line to the throne waved at onlookers as she stepped out of the Queens  Rolls Royce Phantom VI at the West Steps.Wearing a long-sleeved v-neck dress with a low back designed by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos, she beamed as her proud father, the Duke of York, accompanied her.The dress also included a number of symbols meaningful to the bride, including a thistle for Scotland, symbolising the couples fondness for Balmoral, a Shamrock for Ireland as a nod to the Ferguson family, and the York Rose and ivy for the couples home.Buckingham Palace said the low back feature was specically requested by Eugenie as a tribute to surgeons at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, who corrected her scoliosis when she was .

Wonderful. Rich young people may want a spectacular wedding and reception to celebrate their special day. No problem with that.But when the daughter of someone reportedly worth poundm marries and expects the taxpayer to subsidise her dream wedding, the problems begin. Over the past couple of months, as details emerged of the wedding of a minor member of the Royal family, who has no Royal duties, something happened. Media outlets which are normally ‘wedded’ to the notion of monarchy began to criticise the expected reliance on the taxpayer to fund security, cleaning, clearing the streets of homeless people, installation of flags and so on, for the bride’s insistence on riding through the streets of Windsor in an open-topped carriage.  The cost of around poundm for anti-terrorist police and crowd control, plus pound, for barriers, flags, cleaning and storing homeless people’s belongings is to be paid by the public purse.Yes – we are paying to store the belongings of homeless people who have been ‘invited’ to remove their persons from the streets as the bride and groom drive by in an open-topped carriage, while police snipers line the rooftops. On Wednesday I received a petition of , signatures from the campaign group Republic, which I’ve had a long association with, requesting full disclosure of all costs to the taxpayer of today’s wedding, and to refuse to pay this from the public purse. This petition is even larger than the one I received earlier in the year at the time of another Royal wedding, which was far more costly, albeit, to some, more justied. Clearly, a line has been crossed today.  We need full disclosure of all costs to the public for all the Royal family, to include repairs and improvements to property used exclusively by them, tax breaks, and all the weird and arcane laws which permit them to circumnavigate the tax system to which mere mortals are subject. Whatever our thoughts about the long-term existence of the monarchy, we should know what it costs us. Just a mile from Kensington Palace where the newly-weds are to live, in a home we believe to be subsidised by the taxpayer, a fourth food bank is about to open.  It will put food on the table of people whose lives have been decimated by government cuts, low pay – and some by the avoidable atrocity of the Grenfell Tower fire. I’m asking for a debate, not a revolution. And it’s well overdue.Emma Dent Coad is Labour MP for Kensington.

View the first, second and third tranches on Mirror.Youll be banned from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday and race horses will be trapped in Britainwe leave without agreement on  March . The warnings were issued today just as the odds of No Deal grew greater, with a standoff between Downing Street and Tory Brexiteers.  Last night Theresa May summoned her inner circle to discuss plans for a backstop, a backup plan to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. The plan involves, essentially, keeping the whole UK in an EU customs union for a temporary period after the date of Brexit. Boris Johnson says this would render us an EU colony because it would stop the UK signing trade deals around the world.  Such a backstop had been set to end in December . But Downing Street today refused to rule out the possibility of there being no fixed end date. Mrs May will try to persuade  EU leaders to back her plan at a crucial summit next Wednesday. But theres still no agreed plan, and the odds of No Deal are ticking closer. So without further ado... heres what the government says will happenthats the case. Youll barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But the technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. Lights could go out in Northern Ireland  A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. British race horses would be banned from Ireland  All British horses would be banned from travelling to the EU under a worst case No Deal Brexit. This would include racecourses in Ireland. Currently breeding, competition and racehorses can be taken to the Continent with a horse passport and a health certicate or vets approval. If there is no Brexit deal, the UK would have to apply to be listed as a third country. This would allow horses to travel, but force owners to obtain new documents and blood tests costing up to pound extra. If the UK is not accepted as a third country, horses would be unable to travel from the UK to the EU at all. Tonnes of waste could pile up Just days after a human body parts mountain emerged, Britain could be facing a huge pileup of waste as it becomes more dficult to export it to the EU.Our waste exports to Poland have soared % to , tonnes in just four months, according to Greenpeace, after China banned foreign trash. Buttheres no Brexit deal, this will be slapped with a tangle of new red tape. Currently UK waste exporters only need permission from the country they are sending to. Without a Brexit deal, they would need to submit a duly reasoned request to EU authorities. This request would have to explain why the UK does not have and cannot reasonably acquire waste disposal facilities in its own country.

I’m just back from a visit to The Upper Room above the John Paul Centre in central Middlesbrough just round the corner from my office. The centre is owned by the Catholic Church and houses the North Eastern Refugee Service, other agencies and charities. There’s a chapel and shop with religious cards and other merchandise. It’s a place people drop in either for weekday mass or just some contact and conversation in the coffee house. Between . and . every Saturday in The Upper Room on the top floor, free food is provided for the homeless, the destitute- in fact for all- comers, whatever their need. This Saturday, like all the others before, the customers congregate together in the back alley waiting for the session to begin and when the door opens theyre met by a volunteer on the door and each are given a raffle ticket to exchange for food. Theyd already settled in when I arrived.  I climb the stairs to find a room packed with nearly  people, almost all men, but two or three women, ranging from teenagers to pensioners gathered round the tables. Some have clearly come straight from the streets and havent slept indoors for some time and its self evident that for some its been a long time since theyd had the benefit of a shower or put on clean clothes. None of that bothers the volunteers or anyone .  Some of the guests are clearly malnourished and some toothless - old beyond their years. One man presents as quite detached and troubled and shouts out quite randomly. He suddenly calls the room to order to ask for a moment of silence. I suspect like many others in the room, I totally misconstrue what he is trying to say. At the time I think his appeal simply in keeping with the general scene.  Nobody bats an eyelid. Later I learn he was asking us to mark the death of a local woman by the name of Barby Pigg, as he’d seen reported in the local newspaper. He doesnt get many to join in the observance. I should have listened to him more carefully. The volunteers carry on serving the sandwiches, the crisps and bananas. Some were keen for seconds. One of the young lads hasn’t eaten since Thursday and others take a paper bag of extra sandwiches for later. Its plain and obvious that very many of the diners have mental health problems and many have special needs- some severe. My case worker Emma volunteers at The Upper Room and shed arranged for me to go along where I am welcomed to the centre by two of the brilliant volunteers Gamini and Margaret. They speak with such warmth and compassion telling me that they rarely had any trouble. In fact, when someone occasionally forgot themselves and used bad language, more often than not, they corrected themselves and apologised. They tell me the clientele are all iniably very respectful and polite.  I look out on the packed room and its the saddest scene Ive witnessed in many years. Dozens and dozens of people in crisis of one form or another. People who have hit rock bottom. Some quite dishevelled and some dirty -but not all by any means. Many unwell and everyone of them hungry, right in the heart of a town centre busy with shoppers and football fans having a pre-match pint.  As well as our established network of daily food banks, there’s a free food facility run by either churches or charities every day of the week in Middlesbrough, especially for those who simply cant navigate through the foodbank processes. The demand is huge and the volunteers are many, and whilst we are yet to see the full impact of the roll out of Universal Credit that has just started locally, the ious local agencies and voluntary groups know exactly what is coming and they are very very fearful. I stay for much of the hour long session. There is no obvious counselling as such. Just a warm loving welcome and good banter. Nobody is judged. Just a reliable service where people know they can come on a Saturday to get some food. I come home to my uncomfortably comfortable home and weep. Anger, sadness and despair in equal measure. I simply cannot comprehend how in my town, that has contributed so much to our country, such vulnerable people are being treated and expected to survive. How they do survive is beyond me.  Many are on the streets. It is plain and obvious that the state has completely failed them in all of their ious crises and distress, so it falls to the churches, the charities and iniduals to step in and do their best, which they do so devotedly week in week out, but with no sign of the fundamental causes of such poverty misery and isolation being addressed or tackled. They have no voice but they are our brothers and sisters and it has to be our duty as a society to support them and to love them. There is a direct correlation between Government policy and the misery suffered by people down on their luck, or simply not blessed with the attributes needed to survive and thrive.  The absence of the state in responding to such overbearing need is glaring. There is great compassion from great numbers of iniduals, but our local councils and other agencies are without the necessary resources or powers to properly respond. Of course our consciences can be eased by condemning the poor as the authors of their own misfortune. Thats as easy as it is wrong, as well as being grossly unfair and cruel. As with everywhere in our country, here in Middlesbrough there are many people who are doing well, who le has been kind to and they are doing fine and dandy thank you very much. Far too many others are struggling and working as hard as they can to hold it all together but live in fear of it all collapsing around them.  But we all live cheek by jowl with the marginalised and isolated who are, for the main part, shunned and avoided by mainstream society. This is totally unacceptable as well as being completely heart breaking. As Jeremy Corbyn said invoking the Gospel: We will not walk by on the other side. We will treat others as we wish to be treated ourselves Because, but for the grace of God, go I.  Dancing Teresa may be “Having the time of her le” but for millions of our fellow citizens that is not the case. We need to rebuild a Britain that has an effective safety net of a social security and welfare system that catches people when they fall and is there for the vulnerable with supportive institutions that can provide the care, support and love that so many of our sisters and brothers need. The challenge is immense but the need for a Labour Government to respond to this human tragedy has never been greater.

Critics complain UC, merging six benefits into a single structure, is harsher on people both in and out of work and is effectively a near poundbillion welfare cut. Campaigners have said some families could end up pound a month worse off. In its place we want a modern welfare state, helping instead of hurting children .  It comes after former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has described it as a “cruel and shyvindictive” system, warning it will plunge a record five million children below the breadline. Writing in the Mirror Mr Brown said that after  years in politics, he never expected to see poverty and hardship ing on such a terrible scale. His is the most prominent voice to join calls for the system to be scrapped. The Mirror revealed two weeks ago Labour was considering axing the benefit reforms.  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said on Sunday: “I think we are moving to a position now where it is just not sustainable. It will have to go.” Universal Credit introduced one system to replace six benefits: Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit, Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support, Employment Support Allowance and Housing Benefit. When former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith launched it in  he said that it would make work pay.  But the major problem was that it coincided with billions in Tory benefit cuts making it less generous than its design. Three quarters of claimants struggle with bills - according to the DWPs own figures.  Rent arrears soared pound a head in two trial zones, while food bank use in another area, Hastings, rose %. There have also been concerns raised by charities that paying the money to the head of the household fans the flames of domestic abuse.  While just last week the Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey is said to have admitted privately that millions of families will lose pound a month. In June the National Audit Office warned there is no evidence UC is making work pay and it may never be value for money.  Last year , people failed to get their first payment within a six-week limit. Ministers unveiled pound.bn of improvements in November , cutting the six-week wait to five, but critics say it was not enough. While even Mr Duncan Smith called for another poundbillion to be pumped in. After eight delays UC will only finish its rollout in March .

The five-year-old page boy was seen laughing with his cousin Savannah Phillips as they stood inside St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle. Dressed in a smart little suit, he appeared greatly amused as seven-year-old Savannah tipped her head back and pretended to play a trumpet. The prince seemed curious to be at the second royal wedding of the year at the chapel and was seen craning his neck to take in his surroundings. But as the trumpeters took their positions to herald the bride, he didnt appear to find the noise as amusing as Savannahs quieter antics. He was spotted putting his hands over his ears.  He was not the only one startled, as a number of children in the bridal party were seen to jump and even Savannah put her finger in her ear. At another point this morning, future king George - whose little sister, Princess Charlotte, was a bridesmaid - was clocked picking his nose. One viewer later took to Twitter to express their amusement. I am howling at this wedding. I love the Royals! Hats blowing off left right and centre!! Prince George picking his nose! they wrote. Savannah hit the headlines earlier this year with her hilarious antics at Buckingham Palace during the Trooping of the Colour.  The little girl - the daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips - apparently told George to keep quiet, even placing her hand over his mouth. She also helped an upset Charlotte. Today, guests had to cling on to their hats as they made their way to the royal wedding, with a blustery wind threatening their outfits. George and Charlotte waved from a car window as they arrived at the chapel to watch Eugenie and her groom Jack Brooksbank tie the knot. There were plenty of waves and lots of cheeky smiles from the young siblings as they headed up the steps into the chapel.  Another member of the bridal party, a small page boy, was blown over by the sheer force of the wind from Storm Callum. Charlotte was wearing a beautul white dress by Amaia kids with ruffled neck and sleeves and a green sash incorporating the colours of the Mark Bradford artwork in the order of service. Meanwhile, George looked very smart in a shirt with blue piping, navy trousers and a similar, specially designed green belt around his waist. Their parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, also attended the wedding, along with Uncle Prince Harry and Auntie Meghan Markle .  Alongside George and Charlotte in the bridal party were Robbie Williamss daughter Theodora, Maud Windsor, the daughter of Lord Frederick Windsor, and Zara and Mike Tindalls little girl Mia. George and Charlotte have a lot of wedding experience, having already been page boy and bridesmaid for at least three other couples. At todays wedding, bride Eugenie made her entrance in a Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos wedding dress and an emerald tiara.  She waved to crowds as she arrived at the chapels West Steps in a  Rolls Royce Phantom VI, which belongs to the Queen. She was accompanied by her proud dad, the Duke of York. Groom Jack was waiting at the altar for his stunning bride, alongside his best man and brother Tom Brooksbank. He and Eugenie later shared two shy kisses after tying the knot.

Ruth and Eamonn, breaking off from their This Morning twittering duties to bestow a Royal wave on the bride as she drove past their holding facility, and the BBC discussing the brides breasts, were particular highlights.Despite unkind comparisons with the size of the crowds at Harry and Meghans wedding, the bride managed a better dress and combined it with unexpected social activism - displaying scars from childhood surgery to straighten her spine. With one slash of silk, Eugenie lted up the other .million people in the UK with scoliosis.Still, its lovely to see two people get married isnt it  His nerves, her grin, their blind optimism. Throwing their lot in together, for better or worse, for richer and... well. The tiara might be borrowed but theyre not likely to ever claim benefits, unlike a lot of those scoliosis sufferers.Eugenie was  when her spine began to twist, and she got rapid surgery. The vast majority of cases affect adolescent females, and many have to wear a rigid plastic brace for  hours a day, for years, to stop it worsening. If it worsens, it causes problems with the heart, lungs, digestive system and other organs. It can be unbearably painful.Most, when they ask the NHS for help as Eugenie did, go on a list. They wait. They hurt. Their parents or partners stop work. They apply for benefits. And they are turned down, like -year-old Charlotte Ormrod. Charlotte has a double curvature, a deformed hip, and needs a wheelchair. Her lungs have collapsed, the family home has had to be modied, and shes in hospital, on average, once a month. She was refused Disability Living Allowance because she didnt need someones help to stop her dying. Her mums been told Charlotte doesnt need a carer. The bit of DLA that applies to people who cant walk is just pound. a week.Charlotte would need to get it for , years to be as much of a burden to the taxpayer as the poundm police security at Eugenies wedding. Weve had  years of being told that Labours welfare state costs too much. That many scroungers are worse than a few high-spenders and that this is all a matter of choice.Thats why, a few months after negotiating their way into power in , the Tories announced a benefit reform that would create fairness and simplicity.Iain Duncan Smith - for it was he - told the party conference the genuinely sick, disabled or retired had nothing to fear. He added: We will crack down on fraud and help able people off welfare. This means we will have enough resources to provide peace of mind to the very vulnerable.In , we paid out pound.bn due to fraud and error. Last year, it was pound.bn.In  the Major Projects Authority warned that setting up Universal Credit would cost poundbn. This year, the National Audit Office said it might never be value for money. And it costs pound to process each claim, which at the absolute maximum will net a single person over  years old pound. every month.Despite promising to save money, it cost more. Despite promising enough resources for the very vulnerable, food bank usage shot up % in areas where UC was introduced. Despite promising peace of mind, UC has been blamed for suicide after suicide after suicide.And despite promising fairness, UC is designed to be paid a minimum of  weeks in arrears, even though rent, fuel, food and council tax all demand to be paid in advance.Someone designed it that way. They intended to give everyone on benefits - the sick, disabled, dying - more than a month of terror and debt for ideological reasons rather than any financial or social benefit to the nation.Those who signed it off probably also think the wedding of a minor Royal is a sound state investment.  They have never been disabled. In fact the things that are wrong with them which would render them unemployable in our world - innumeracy, lack of strategic thought, howling nationalist insanity - are the qualities which have propelled them to some of the most influential, and dangerous, positions in the land.This is the party that voted through George Osbornes poundbn of cuts to UC. This is the party that has been told, for  years, that its flagship policy is an unworkable, amoral, tax sink. This is the party that applauded as its leader danced with joy, as they were warned it would plunge .m people into Victorian levels of misery.Gordon Brown said it would lead to millions of children going to school ill-clad and hungry. Thats not a reform. Thats a crime against humanity. So thank heavens for the first Royal wedding that showed the nation where the scar is. By showing the human beneath the ermine, Eugenie did more to demonstrate the social injustice of Tory rule than any other Royal. She proved disability strikes anyone, that the rich can overcome it, and the problem with our nation is not who was given what by accident of birth but that more of us do not use those gts wisely.We have not appreciated our spines, or our welfare state. We have not considered that % of us could get scoliosis, or how we would cope with no money for  weeks and less than pound a week after that.Those of us who are numerate, empathetic and sane will be considering it now. The Tories, on the other hand, are telling charities defending UC claimants to sign contracts promising not to be mean to Esther McVey in case all of this ends up making her look bad.With repeated slashes, they are destroying one of the most noble and needed projects our nation ever began. The Tories greatest danger is the sort of warning Eugenie, from her position of influence, just shouted to the world. When she stepped out to marry the man of her dreams, everyone with scoliosis felt their toes twitch.And for that kind of publicity, Id say that poundm was indeed a sound state investment. Its a small price to pay for a Royal stamp of disapproval."},{"url":null,"title":"hilarious moment jack brooksbank struggles","story":"NewsHilarious moment Jack Brooksbank struggles to get wedding ring onto Princess Eugenies fingerPrincess Eugenie of York and Jack Brooksbank have married at St Georges Chapel in Windsor in front of many famous facesShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am celebrity-news video hilarious-moment-jack-struggles-wedding-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrincess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank are officially man and we.And while their wedding may have looked like something straight out of a fairy tale, the day still came with a few bumps along the road, as was to be expected.

Eugenie looked stunning as she entered the chapel in her beautul dress and a tiara encrusted with emeralds - which shes borrowed from none other than the Queen. The princess opted not to wear the wedding veil - bucking the tradition, unlike Meghan Markle - and theres a fascinating reason why. Brides historically have worn veils as a symbolic reference to their virginity and modesty, although these days lots of brides wear them just for tradition. But there may be a dferent reason why Princess Eugenie has shunned the veil.  Princess Eugenie had a surgery for her scoliosis when she was a child and its left a scar on her back. Ahead of the wedding, she revealed in an interview with ITVs This Morning that it was really important to her not to hide her scoliosis surgery scars. She told host Eamonn Holmes: I had an operation when I was  on my back, and youll see on Friday, but its a lovely way to honour the people who looked after me and a way of standing up for young people who also go through this. I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think its really special to stand up for that.  So thats one really important one. Eugenie was diagnosed with scoliosis when she was  years old and received treatment to straighten her spine at the National Orthopaedic Hospital. People on social media have noticed the move from Princess Eugenie - and have tweeted their dfering opinions on the matter. One said: Oh my gosh Eugenie looks amazing.

Homes are likely to face a risk of flooding and buildings could be damaged, while some could be cut off by the extreme weather. It is expected that nearly a MONTHs rain could fall in just  hours, with up to six inches predicted.  The Met Office has also issued a series of yellow weather warnings stretching from the north-west coast of Scotland to Lands End, including Northern Ireland - while a number of flood warnings and alerts are in force across south-west England and south Wales. Winds could hit mph and coastal areas are anticipated to be badly hit. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkhill said: Weve got a wind warning which covers all the western side of the UK from am. That in itself is likely to bring disruption to roads and there is likely to be some bridge closures and power outages. We also have yellow and amber warnings of between mm and mm of rain for Wales.

Environmental health officers from Leicester City Council shut down Toros Express on Monday after an inspection following anonymous complaints about rodent activity at the store. Feizal Hajat, prosecuting, applied magistrates today for an emergency order to keep the takeaway iclosed until further notice, reports Leicestershire Live . He told the citys magistrates court: “Our officers visited the premises at .am on Monday and what they found led them to close the business down immediately.  “They deemed the business posed a serious risk to the health of the public.” Elizabeth Johnson, an environmental health officer at Leicester City Council, said she visited Toros Express and carried out an inspection. She said: “I was quite shocked. Rodent activity was quite extensive. “In the preparation area we found droppings under all the equipment. We found cardboard had been laid on the floor under all this equipment.  “As well as congealed grease it was stained with what appeared to be mice urine as well as mouse droppings, fruit flies and maggot cases. “Under an oven I noted a kne had been dropped. A mouse dropping was stuck on the blade. “There was extensive evidence of mouse activity throughout the premises, as well as very poor standards of cleanliness and actual contaminated food. “Pest control was not effective. The amount of dirt and food debris on the floor meant that mice would have plenty of food to feed on in preference to eating any poisoned bait laid down.  “In my professional opinion, the premises were unsanitary and warranted immediate legal action. We closed it immediately.” Ms Johnson said she spoke to Rafiq Yusuf – the food business operator who had taken over the takeaway in February this year. She said she told Mr Yusuf about the court date and advised him about cleaning that needed to be done at the takeaway. Ms Johnson said she had visited Toros Express at am on Wednesday morning and noted improved cleaning but saw fresh mouse droppings.  The health official handed the magistrates bench an exhibit of a lettuce from the food storage area of the takeaway which had been gnawed by mice. The lettuce, in a clear plastic bag, was passed around the courtroom. Chairwoman of the bench Fiona Tee-Boon granted the Hygiene Emergency Prevention Order.

Flavourings in e-cigarettes harm the lungs by triggering inflammation, scientists have warned. The battery-powered devices are promoted as a tool to help smokers quit the habit. But even short term use causes as much or more damage as the real thing, said the Greek team. In experiments on mice they found the additives, including flavourings, caused lung inflammation similar or worse than that seen in traditional cigarette use.  Corresponding author Dr Constaninos Glynos said: The observed detrimental effects in the lung upon e-cigarette vapour exposure in animal models highlight the need for further investigation of safety and toxicity of these rapidly expanding devices worldwide. They simulate smoking a traditional cigarette by dispensing a vapour derived from liquid chemicals in a refillable cartridge that typically contain propylene glycol, nicotine and often flavourings. Propylene glycol - a colourless and odourless additive - is found in numerous processed food and beverages. It is also used as a solvent in a number pharmaceuticals. The findings, published in the American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular, show e-cigs and refills are not well regulated - and their long-term effects on health are unknown. So the researchers compared several groups of mice that received whole-body exposure to ying chemical combinations four times each day, with every session separated by -minute smoke-free intervals.  Dr Glynos said: Electronic cigarettes are advertised as a less harmful nicotine delivery system or as a new smoking cessation tool. Our findings suggest that exposure to e-cig vapour can trigger inflammatory responses and adversely affect respiratory system mechanics. In many cases, the added flavor in e-cigs exacerbated the detrimental effects of e-cig vapour. One group received cigarette smoke and three others e-cig vapours containing either propylene glycol, both this and nicotine or these two ingredient and a tobacco flavouring. A fth batch just got normal, healthy air and acted as a control. Some animals in each party underwent the regime for three daysand others four weeks . There was an increase in markers of inflammation, mucus production and altered lungin all three e-cig groups - after only three days. But those getting propylene glycol alone showed fewer negative effects with long-term exposure. Dr Glynos, of the University of Athens, said this suggests the additive elicits only a temporary irritation that eventually subsides with continued use. In addition, two inflammation-producing proteins became elevated in the flavouring group.  This means some of the many flavouring components on the market may not be safe for even short-term use, said Dr Glynos. The condition of the e-cig groups alarmed the researchers. The level of oxidative stress - damage at a cellular level - in those exposed to flavourings was equal to or higher than that of the cigarette group. However, respiratory mechanics were adversely affected only in mice exposed to cigarette smoke - and not to e-cig vapour after prolonged treatment. Dr Glynos added: We conclude that both e-cig vaping and conventional cigarette smoking negatively impact lung biology. His findings follow a British study earlier this year that also suggested vaping is more harmful than previously thought. It found some of the effects are similar to those seen in smokers and people with chronic lung disease - boosting the production of inflammatory chemicals in the body. The University of Birmingham scientists extracted cells from lung samples provided by healthy non-smokers and exposed them to e-cig fluid, condensed vapour or nothing for  hours. Exposure to the vapour increased cell death and the production of inflammatory chemicals. And the ability of cells to engulf bacteria was signicantly impaired in those exposed to vapour. Public Health England says e-cigs are  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes. And they suggest smokers should consider switching to vaping in a bid to help them quit. But critics warn vaping may cause lung disease, keep people hooked on nicotine, or act as route in to smoking for kids. Some .million Brits smoke and .million use e-cigs, Office for National Statistics figures show.

Data scientists pinpointed the B from Cheddar to Ashwick, which meanders through the rolling Mendip Hills as the most pleasant to cruise along. Second is Forres to Alford, in Scotland, a stunning -mile drive through the Cairngorms National Park with the A, from Moffat towards Edinburgh, Scotland, in third. Experts used key criteria to judge roads including scenery, how close they are to points of interest, and which ones offer optimal driving conditions, before announcing their top . They also looked at how many ‘engaging’ corners would be encountered, levels of traffic and sites with low incident reports to compile the detailed list.  The research was created by Volkswagen in collaboration with traffic and navigation app Waze, to support Volkswagen’s ‘GTI Superdrives’ programme within the app. Taking fourth spot is the A, also known as the Black Mountain Road, which takes in the stunning scenery of the Brecon Beacons in Wales. Making up the top five is the A near Glencoe in the Scottish Highlands.  The Hardknott Pass, a winding single track road in the Lake District which is thought to be the steepest road in England, is number nine on the list. The GTI Superdriveswithin Waze lets drivers know when they’re coming close to one of the roads on the list via a GTI badge popping up when the app is active. If they are within  miles of a GTI Superdrive road, motorists are able to tap on the badge to receive directions to it.  Alison Jones, Director of Volkswagen UK, said: “Our GTI badge quite simply stands for driving joy. “Working with Waze, we wanted to offer more drivers the chance to get off the often congested ‘beaten track’ and instead experience the simple pleasure of driving once more. “The aim, very clearly, is about enjoying time behind the wheel – not speeding or driving in a way that increases risk – and we believe that the intelligence of the Waze app helps drivers do just that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meet tony bark who identifies","story":"NewsMeet Tony Bark who identies as a DOG and wears a puppy mask that looks like Avengers Iron ManWARNING ADULT CONTENT Tony McGinn says animal role-play has brought him closer to his partner and \"handler\" AndrewShareCommentsByJoe Roberts:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video meet-tony-bark-who-identies-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA human pup known as Tony Bark says identying as a dog has brought him closer to his partner. Tony McGinn, whose chosen name is similar to Iron Man hero Tony Stark, has been into animal role-play his entire le. And he even sports a mask similar to the one worn by Robert Downey Jr in the popular Marvel films. The -year-old, from Los Angeles, says it has brought him and husband and handler Andrew, , closer together. Andrew regularly accompanies Tony, who is transgender, to play dates with other role-players.  Tony said: “To me a dog is everything pure in the world. Dogs experience the world through a lens of pure joy that I don’t think other animals have. “A lot of little kids like to play like they’re a dog and most of them grow out of it. I just never grew out of that. “And now in my adult le, in my relationships, it’s a way for me to feel vulnerable and exposed and close to my partner. It’s a very intimate thing. “Imaginethe easiest way to delight your partner is you just throw a ball across the room. Relationships wouldn’t fail anymorethat’s all you had to do.”  Andrew added: “I hang out and I provide him with lots of attention and tell him he is a good boy. That’s basically  percent of it. “I think everyone should feel comfortable exploring the limits of their creativity and imagination and most of us have grown up in a culture that strongly discourages you from taking it too far. “I appreciate that I am married to someone who encourages me to explore my imagination and my interests wherever they lead and I try to do the same.” The couple have known each other since  and have three dogs of their own, which they refer to as “bio dogs”. But that doesn’t mean Tony doesn’t think of himself as a ‘real dog’. He states confidently that he “identies as a dog” and says pet play is about getting into the head-space of the animal.  “Pet play is anytime that a person takes on the role of an animal,” he explained. “They emulate that animal either through their behaviour or their actions. “I do consider myself as a pup at all times every day, but I don’t engage in pet play every day. “We engage in pet play actively a few times a month, and it’s often in a social setting such as a club or an event. “Some people wear costumes, some people try to get into the head space of the animal and think as an animal would.” Tony does all of these, donning a home-made dog “hood” for his pet play meetings, as well as a dildo harness which he reverses and uses to hold a rubber silicone tail. But he maintains that his pastime remains an entirely innocent hobby. “For me it’s not sexual but it’s still a form of intimacy because it is a vulnerable place,” he said. “It’s a bit of a power dynamic that puts Andrew in charge and I enjoy that.”  Andrew added: “We don’t make it sexual but I have nothing against those who do. More power to those who do.” Tony particularly enjoys playing fetch and tug of war with Andrew, who says he is happy to act as Tony’s handler. “In a practical sense all I really do is help fill out the fantasy by being the human,” said Andrew. “In the same way a human looks after their pet to make sure that their pet doesn’t have a little too much fun and hurt themselves. “I bring water and just tell Tony when he needs to chill out.” But pet play is not just a personal hobby for the couple. Tony has won numerous competitions and awards for his pet play, including two ‘best in show’ awards. “People come to my house and they see my ribbons and they say, ‘Oh, you have won all those ribbons at dog shows.’ “But they rarely askI am the dog.”  Six years ago, Andrew and Tony became part of the LA Pony and Critter Club – an animal role-play group founded by Ann Noble. Ann, who says she started the club to provide a safe space for people to explore animal role-play, holds regular ‘play dates’ for her members. “We have just the best time,” said Ann. “Every time I do it, it’s like the best time of my le, it’s the best moment of my le. “There’s a dference between childish and child-like. Animal role-play allows you, as an adult, to recapture those childlike moments of the world being extraordinary. “There’s childlike moments of, ‘WhatI did this ’ and the magic of doing that.” The LA Pony and Critter Club founder now spends most of her time training other pony role-players, but has her own animal persona, Beauty the pony, who she says has got her through some hard times. “There are times when I go to do things in le – everything from hiking a mountain to getting through paper work – and Beauty will march through it. She is strong. She has a lot of heart.”  The group holds numerous events, including dog shows, herding events, and a biannual fox hunt where human pups hunt down human foxes in a kind of ‘capture the flag’ scenario. All of which might seem unusual to those outside the animal role-play community, but Tony says he rarely,ever, has to deal with criticism or judgement from others. “I consider myself out and very open,” said Tony. “That being said, I do compartmentalise my pet play because not everyone wants or needs to see that. “My family, for example. I think they have a general idea that I am into some kinky stuff but we don’t talk about it. “The thing is, most people when you say I am going to a dog show and I am participating in the dog show, they kind of, assume you are not the dog. “So I never had to explain that. I never have faced any sort of discrimination.”  Andrew added: “I think people misunderstand pet play when they place the concepts of sex, animals, and pretending next to each other and get freaked out. “Once you get up close and see their relationship to one another, you realise it’s pretty benign. “A lot of people expect it to be a taboothey are not familiar with it. But when you live in Los Angeles in , being close-minded about someone’s weird hobby is more damming than any weird hobby could be.” Tony added: “I think everyone should try it once, andthey like it, they should try it a second time.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mums horror four year old","story":"NewsMums horror as four-year-old daughter brings back crack cocaine from daycareSabrina Straker was shocked when her little girl showed her the illegal drug she got her hands on at a day centreShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  OCT NewsSerenity had crack cocaine on her when she ed from school \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum was horried when her four-year-old daughter came home from daycare with crack cocaine on her.

Cheyanne Perry, , of South Carolina, USA, is battling the tormenting symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and Gastroparesis. The symptoms of her chronic illnesses started worsening in her teens, forcing her to be homeschooled at  and connected to a feeding tube three years later. Due to the worsening of her symptoms, Cheyanne hasn’t eaten a single piece of food in three years and currently takes all of her college classes online. To prevent her le-threatening symptoms, her family and fianceacute Silvino Suarez cook in the second kitchen they built in the garage, use unscented shampoos, soaps and detergents and refrain from wearing perfumes.  As part of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, the student also battles muscle weakness and the dislocation of several joints a day. She has to stay in the house most days and wears a protective face mask whenever she goes outside to reduce the risk of allergic reactions. Cheyanne, who studies psychology, said: “I’m allergic to basically everything. That’s the joke I usually make. “I can have reactions to perfumes, smoke from the fireplace, the temperature and even the scent of the shampoo someone recently used. “The most dficult part has been the inability to be around most people. “I am grateful that my parents and fianceacute were willing to change their entire lestyle for me. “I got a full scholarship to college, but couldn’t go because my symptoms got so bad. “I am taking all my college classes online and hope to become a psychologist in the future. “None of us were expecting the severity of it to be like this, but everyone has been very helpful.”  Cheyanne currently dislocates two to three joints a day, but she used to do it dozens of times in a -hour period before learning how to reduce the risk. She recalls times in the past in which her fingers would pop out of their socket just from picking up her backpack. Cheyanne said: “That symptom is not as bad anymore, partly because I know how to be cautious and partly because I stay home a lot. “I used to dislocate so many of my joints just from doing everyday things.” While the conditions have limited her to what she can do, they have also inspired her to become a psychologist for others in similar situation. When seeking therapy during her rough times with the illness, Cheyanne noticed there were very few counsellors who had gone through the same things.  Now she plans to one day offer therapy for patients struggling with chronic illnesses. Cheyanne said: “When I was looking for someone to talk to about what I was going through, I noticed that none of the psychologists had actually dealt with a chronic illness. “That’s when I realized that someone like me who has been through it is much needed. “When you are struggling with something this severe, you should have a professional to speak to who understands exactly how you are feeling.” Since Cheyanne’s symptoms can worsen at any moment, she cannot predict the state of her health in the future. However, she likes to maintain a positive attitude and has a lot of hope that things will improve. She said: “It’s really dficult with these illnesses. I can feel better for months at a time and then unexpectedly wind up in the hospital again. “No matter what happens, I always have hope that things will get better for me.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/IMG_0451.jpg.jpg ","title":"dundee fans group writes to top officials over referee steven mcleans links to kilmarnock","story":"Angry Dundee fans have written to two top refereeing officials over whistler Steven McLean being put in charge of Saturday’s controversial clash with Kilmarnock despite having strong family connections with the Ayrshire club.McLean blundered by awarding the second-half penalty that saw Killie take the three points from the Dens Park clash.And supporters with long memories are unhappy he was handling the proceedings despite his father, Stewart, making over  appearances for the Rugby Parkers between  and .To add to the conspiracy theories, for  years he was a team-mate of Paul Clarke – brother of their current boss Steve.The pair even appeared on the same sticker in an edition of the annual Panini football album.All that’s prompted the Dundee Supporters’ Association to write to SFA head of referees’ committee chairman Willie Young and their head of refereeing, John Fleming, to question the sense behind having McLean taking games involving Kilmarnock.“Several of our members have contacted me to express their concerns over this and we think it’s only right to pass them on to the authorities,” said DSA chairman Kenny Ross.“And I do think there is reason to question the validity of this appointment when the referee so clearly has family connections to Kilmarnock.“If nothing  it puts him in a dficult position when you get a decision like Saturday’s.“I know that Steven McLean’s brother Brian played for Dundee United, Ross County and a few other clubs and he was not allowed to take charge of games involving teams he was at.“You think the same common sense approach could have been applied to his dad’s old team.”The fans also pointed out should the Killie player who ed to win the kick, Jordan Jones, be handed a two-game ban, that in itself could damage Dundee.The games he would miss would be against St Mirren and Hamilton, the two sides immediately above the Dark Blues at the foot of the Premiership.SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell was copied in when the letter was e-mailed and has promised a response will be given."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/15507960-763x564.jpg ","title":"kilmarnock star jordan jones faces two match ban over alleged dive against dundee","story":"Kilmarnock winger Jordan Jones has been charged with ing by the Scottish Football Association.Jones has been hit with a notice of complaint over the penalty incident which led to his team’s winner at Dundee on Saturday and faces a two-match banthe case is proven.Dundee manager Neil McCann insisted there was no contact after Jones went down under the attention of Cammy Kerr before Eamonn Brophy netted from the spot to earn KIllie a -

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked.

Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"council-approves-building-of-57-affordable-homes","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has approved plans to build  affordable homes in Chirnside.Springfield Properties, which is based in Elgin, Moray, plans to build a new affordable housing estate behind Northfield terrace, with an access point on Main Street East End.The developers have also confirmed that the scheme will be taken over by a local affordable housing provider which will wholly own and operate the development.However, the proposals have been met with several objections from Chirnside residents, who raised concerns around road access, parking, housing density and the impact on local house prices.Mrs Margaret Thomson Malone, a neighbour of the proposed site, wrote: ldquoThere will be numerous traffic jams, there already are several times a day when two heavy lorries meet on a road packed with parked cars.ldquoWhere do you think all the people who would live in these houses are going to park when it snows or is covered in ice as it is every winter at some point ldquoSeveral people have now decided to sell their houses.

Pressure on the roads and pressure on the sewage system, as obviously itrsquos a smaller village and a rural location, but I think officers have addressed this issue.ldquoI think with approval of this

team and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

Her conference speech was almost Presbyterian in its downbeat realism: you can wave all the flags you want, but therersquos no short cut to independence.Most of her troops get this. The SNP MP Angus MacNeill used precisely the wrong historical analogy when he urged Nicola Sturgeon not to ldquodither like the Jacobites at Derby . Modern Scottish nationalists, like Nicola Sturgeon, loathe comparisons with Bonnie Prince Charlie and heroic failures like the lsquo. Nor is she an enthusiast for the politics of naive optimism.She knows that, evenopinion polls started showing a majority in favour of independence, Theresa May is not going to allow another referendum in the foreseeable future. Westminster must pass a so-called Section  Order to legitimise a referendum on the constitution, and the PM made clear last year that shersquos not going to table one. MPs would probably reject itshe did. For her part, Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly made clear she will not entertain any illegal referendums, not least because Unionists would boycott them, as in Catalonia in .This is not going to change any time soon. In her ldquonow is not the time interview in March , Mrs May gave three reasons for refusing a Section . First, that voters are confused right now second, that a second independence referendum would interfere with negotiations over Brexit and third, that Scots need to know what the future relationship with the EU is going to be before making up their minds about relations with the UK. Ms Sturgeon agrees that the ldquofog of Brexit as she put it yesterday, has to clear before any sensible choice can be made about Scottish independence. That ldquotriple mandate for independence,she won last year is not enough.But will the fog clear  EvenMrs May s with an acceptable exit deal before Christmas, the confusion over Brexit will be far from over. Any deal with Brussels will be limited to the orce bill, EU citizensrsquo rights and the Irish backstopand this will not be the end of Brexit uncertainly. It wonrsquot even be the end of the beginning.The latest version of the Chequers deal,appears to involve the UK remaining in the Customs Union until a ldquofriction-free solution emerges to trade across the Irish border. This is the so-called ldquoblind Brexit under which Britain leaves the EU in March without any clarity about future trading relations. It suits hard Brexiters because once wersquore out, wersquore out.But this half-in-half-out arrangement is not just confined to the transition period, which is supposed to end in . Indeed, it will almost certainly continue after that. My reading of the negotiations is that Britain is heading towards a ldquoSwitzerland minus outcome. The Swiss are not members of the EU, or the EEA or formally the European Single Market. However, they accept all the rules of the ESM on a ldquobilateral basis, meaning that they accept changes as they come along, not en masse, as it were.Itrsquos a fine distinction, and most people agree that Switzerland is in the single market for all intents and purposes. It accepts the four freedoms, including freedom of movement, and largely rubber-stamps rulings of the European Court of Justice. However, it is not actually in the ESM, which makes it Brexit-compliant. Mrs May will try to get a Switzerland-type deal, minus any formal acceptance of freedom of movement. But this will likely be fudged over a y transition in which the destination will be clear, but neither side will openly admit it.Except for Ms Sturgeon, who will want to call a spade a spade. If there is a transition deal that explicitly confirms regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland with the single market ndash which is what the ldquohybrid backstop also seems to involve ndash she will rightly call for Scotland to get parity. The Northern Ireland back-stop is similar to the hybrid arrangement she proposed for Scotland in the Scottish Government White Paper, Scotlandrsquos Place in Europe, back in . .But the downside is that Brussels and the UK could end up with an open-ended transition period in which Britain is out of the European Union, but remains in an uncertain relationship to its institutions. This means Scottish voters could be no clearer on our long-term relations with Europe than they are now. This purgatory could easily last  years, during which no UK government will agree to an independence referendum for Scotland, on the grounds that nothing is clear until everything is clear.I suspect realisation that the fog of Brexit is going to linger helped persuade the First Minister, belatedly, to support a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit. On the BBC Andrew Marr show she made clear SNP MPs will vote for a repeat referendum on Brexit, eventhere is no guarantee of indyref. The polls may indicate that support for independence would rise with a hard Brexit, but it is much better for the cause of Scottish independencethe UK doesnrsquot leave the EU at all. It would mean Scotland could seamlessly depart from the UK without there being any hard border with England, and without Scotland having to formally leave the EU.There is now a slim chance that a Peoplersquos Vote might happen. That Britain will wake up from the Brexit nightmare. But that would be a triumph of hope over experience."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/2237318.jpg?type=article-full","title":"call-for-consumer-helpline-to-get-scots-out-of-fuel-poverty","story":"The advice line is one of the recommendations in a Citizens Advice Scotland report that warns that over one in ten Scottish households are using electric heating - the most expensive form of domestic fuel ndash and three times as costly as gas.It finds that those who rely on electric heat are almost twice as likely to be in fuel poverty compared to the population of Scotland as a whole.The report found that many using electricity are on low incomes and unlikely to access the support that is available or to switch to cheaper fuel sources.Official figures show that .% of all Scots households are in fuel poverty, meaning that they spend more than % of household income on fuel.:Government urged to take real action on fuel poverty in Warm Homes BillBut the report says the fuel poverty figure for electricity users, according to  data, is %, while for gas users it is %.Publishing the Hard Wired Problems report, CAS energy spokesman Craig Salter said that there is a perception that high costs are \"unavoidable and inevitable\" when using electric heating.His Hard Wired Problems report says consumers were receiving \"mixed messages\" about electric heating from dferent organisations such as energy suppliers, installers of energy efficiency measures, governments, the regulator and support agencies \"adding to the confusion\".There were \"misconceptions\" over the benefits of switching and a \"lack of information\" on all electricity-only tarfs.The analysis, assisted by research undertaken by Energy Action Scotland and Glasgow Caledonian University, suggests as one of its recommendations, that the Scottish Government should support the set up of a helpline to provide impartial advice dealing with issues relating to electric heating, including its operation, metering, tarfs, and how to access financial support.This would form part of an expanded \"bespoke service\" aimed at providing expert advice.It also said there was a ldquoclear need for more consistent messaging ldquoacross organisations about electric heating.Mr Salter said: ldquoElectric heating is by far the most costly heating type in Scotland, yet many of the people who use it are those least able to afford it. So they are paying over the odds to heat their home.ldquoPeople are in this situation for a iety of reasons. In some cases electricity is the only source available, as gas supply pipes donrsquot reach their home. In other cases they are renting their home so have to accept whatever system the landlord has installed.ldquoThe good news is that there are some excellent support services out there, but they are not reaching everyone who needs them. So we need to make sure that electricity users know they can access specialist support that is tailored to their needs.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoOver the letime of this parliament we are investing over half a billion pounds to tackle energy efficiency and fuel poverty, and we are taking forward landmark legislation to eradicate fuel poverty for good.

The investigation also found just three companies own more than half of Englandrsquos quota while some fishermen hoard quota on vessels which never cast a net.Nearly half of England and Walesrsquo quota is held by companies based outside the those countries, despite reforms to the EUrsquos fisheries policy which encourage national governments to allocate fishing quota on social and environmental grounds.It is claimed that the ownership of quota by large-scale fishing firms also poses greater risk to the environment and fish stocksmore destructive fishing practices are deployed, an allegation strenuously denied by the families themselves.Scottish Greens environment spokesman Mark Ruskell MSP said: ldquoThis investigation should serve as a reminder that much of Scotlandrsquos fishing industry is in the grip of a handful of very rich people ... , many of them putting profit before science, happy to wipe the seas clean rather than manage stocks sustainably so we have food for the future.ldquoFishing industry voices have actively encouraged the kind of deregulated free-for-all the Toriesrsquo Brexit crisis is dragging us toward, posing massive risks to jobs and public services in our coastal communities.  per cent of whatrsquos caught in Scottish waters is sold to the EU so the isolationism of Brexit will ruin our export economy.ldquoIf we want a future for fisheries we need to distribute quotas to more local and sustainable operators. Itrsquos an agenda that so far neither the SNP nor the Tories have shown any interest in but Greens will continue to push forward.Scottish Fishermanrsquos Federation chief executive Bertie Armstrong said: ldquoOnce again, Greenpeace is guilty of painting a completely  picture of the UK fishing industry to match its particular prejudices.ldquoSustainability has for many years been the number one priority for the industry, and many sacrices have been made to reach the present position where for key stocks catches are at record or near record high levels while pressure on those stocks from fishing vessels is at a record low, as testied by recent academic study.ldquoStudies also show that for pelagic species large vessels which require massive capital investment are signicantly more environmentally friendly than a fleet of smaller vessels, not to mention safer in wild offshore winter seas where and when much of the catching of this type takes place.ldquoThe only thing that has eroded our coastal communities is a blatantly inequitable EU Common Fisheries Policy which awards other fishing nations  per cent of our fish stocks.ldquoInstead of focusing on the events of well over a decade ago to carry out a hatchet job, Greenpeace should be crediting the industry for its forward thinking approach."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-theresa-mays-end-to-austerity-pledge-big-tory-con-if-public-sector-spending-not-increased","story":"The Labour leader eschewed the subject of Brexit and concentrated his fire at PMQs on austerity, pressing the Prime Minister on how she planned to end the funding squeeze on the police, the NHS, schools, councils and disabled people following her unexpected party conference vow.But Mrs May hit back, claiming Labours plans would cost people pound trillion and, after all the countryrsquos hard work, thrust it back to square one.She repeated her pledge to end austerity and told MPs: \"What is not being brought to an end is fiscal responsibility.\"During sharp exchanges and after the PM raised her Governmentrsquos actions on tackling the issue of mental health, Mr Corbyn pointed to cuts to mental health budgets, the police and other areas as he asked when would austerity finally be over.\"Today there are , fewer mental health nurses than there were in .

The huge sums have been made by large-scale fishermen, with five wealthy families controlling one-third of Scotlandrsquos total quota, despite the entire pelagic fleet consisting of just  vessels.But for those outside the big companies, fishing is becoming a less and less profitable pursuit due to a quota system that favours larger enterprises over small vessels.A study by Greenpeacersquos investigative unit claims to reveal a vastly unequal system where a minority of wealthy families control huge swathes of fishing rights to the detriment of local fishermen.In desperation, many small scale fishermen resort to contacting larger outfits, or those they know have Fixed Quota Allocationsthat they do not fish. Those owners can set their own prices and lease out quota, allowing the fisherman to catch more.The prices set for leasing out FQA can y by hundreds of pounds. To lease a tonne of cod for example, can cost from pound to pound. The resulting catch might bring just pound, at market, meaning a profit margin of pound before staff and equipment costs.According to Greenpeace, the situation has left some fishermen going out on boats alone because they cannot afford to pay a crew, while others have found that, after boat costs, they are still losing money and have stopped fishing altogether.Jerry Percy, founder of the Under Ten Fishermenrsquos Association, which represents small scale fishermen, said: ldquoThe fish in our seas are a public resource, itrsquos yours and mine, managed by Government on our behalf. They should therefore never be treated as just another commodity, to be bought and sold to the highest bidder.ldquoThe hoarding of quota risks creating a distorted market in which the price of fish stocks, and access to them, is controlled by just a few companies.The problem, say critics, dates back to the s when economists argued that the problem of diminishing fish stocks brought about by fleet expansion and mass industrialisation should be solved by the market. They proposed that states create a limited right to catch fish that could be bought and sold.Iceland was one of the first countries to implement this market-based policy in the Eighties. Their fish stocks began to recover and the fishing fleet grew more profitable. But the privatisation of once common fishing-rights led to many fishermen becoming dispossessed as banks started trading in fishing rights and the system eventually crashed.In the UK, the price of large fishing boats and their associated right-to-fish has rocketed, which has led to many young people being priced out. In many cases only large companies with the backing of banks can buy boats.Greenpeace hope the UK can succeed where Iceland failed, and rein in the market to create a fairer system.Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said: ldquoHow long before the Government stops blaming other countries, looks at its own broken system, accepts responsibility for fixing it and creates a fairer and more sustainable distribution of fishing quota across the UK  With the Fisheries Bill rumoured to be just weeks away, there has never been a better opportunity to do just this.A spokesman for Lunar Fishing said: ldquoThe quota available to the inshore fleetis more than the under-m fleet can catch, so there is no merit in the suggestion that there is disadvantage to the lsquosmall-scale fishermenrsquo.ldquoIn fact the vast majority of fish caught requires larger vessels to catch because of location, depth and weather challenges. It would be impossible for the inshore fleet to catch a small percentage of the quota.ldquoIn relation to workforce, Lunar uses the quota to employ around  people in the local communities of Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Aberdeen. Many more are employed in providing services to the company.A spokesman for Sir Ian Woodrsquos fishing arm, the Don Fishing Co and JW Holdings, said: ldquoBoth come from strong fish catching backgrounds with Sir Ian Woodrsquos father, grandfather and great grandfather all being fishermen. The Don operates as a management and fish selling company working on behalf of about  vessels in which it has mainly minority shares and another  vessels which it helps manage and sell the fish. The Don Corsquos one and only reason for owning some quota itself and helping a large number of fishing vessels to buy their own quota is to enable the vessels to have sufficient quota to be viable.A spokesman for Andrew Marr International said: ldquoAMI fully supports robust fishery management including full compliance to protect fish stocks and sustainable fishing. AMI has  vessels in the English Fully Documented Fishery Scheme with on board camera monitoring.ldquoThe main stocks that AMI fishes for in the North Sea are cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, monkfish. In these species, the Under  fleet have excess quota that they have not used in the last several years.A spokesman for Interfish said: ldquoAcross our fleet we were the first UK fleet to achieve full certication against the Responsible Fishing Scheme in  and maintained this against the new standard in  ndash no other fleet of skippers have achieved this standard.ldquoInterfish are active within several MSC client groups enabling sustainable certication of offshore and inshore fisheries."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-can-the-new-bbc-scotland-channel-make-scotland-happy","story":"What you do therefore is grab your audience where you can, when you can.

Now, thatrsquos a toughie, Steve, because Scotland has a history of covering up one eye while looking in the mirror.

Given the taster we watched it seems your Auntie Cissie in Kilsyth will find shows such as this a less natural fit than she would a nose ring and ripped jeans.Yet, the new channel isnrsquot ignoring those who prefer TV to be about people rather than what people put on their faces. Documentaries planned include Last Breath, which features the tale of the North Sea er stranded on the seabed with only five minutes of oxygen left. The agedwill sink into this human drama, which incorporates actual footage with the drama.Yes, BBC Scotland would be mad not to spread bet its poundm budget.

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision.

The new strategy will shape the country’s transport priorities for the next  years.Age Scotland and Transport Scotland have said they have been working closely with older people in communities across island, rural and urban Scotland since spring to understand how transport affects older peoples’ daily lives.Gillian Skuse, Charity Director of Age Scotland Orkney, stressed how important it is that local older people get involved in these discussions.“We’ve heard from older people around the islands that transport can impact their mobility, running their errands, enjoying activities and being part of their local communities. This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed. Tea and coffee will be available on arrival from . am with the day starting at . am. A soup and sandwich lunch will be served at .pm after the event ends.To book your place in this free event, contact Age Scotland on    or helen.simpson@agescotland.org.uk by October .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online. In every case of a branch closing we are committed to providing the best possible range of alternatives.\"Friday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It feels like being trapped in a sinking ship. Itrsquos so sad walking through empty streets. I donrsquot want to move but I also donrsquot want to be the only person living on the street.\"With the housing crisis the way it is just now, it seems madness to talk, as some have, about compulsory purchase orders for new housing when they donrsquot look after what they have.

His request for figures found  per cent of council houses on Meiklefield Road were considered void.He said most people canrsquot afford to buy homes and \"that the real crisis is the serious void in the number of social homes available in an area where people find themselves in precarious employment, being paid ever-decreasing wages while the cost of living continues an alarming spike upwards.\"Dingwall and Seaforth ward councillor Graham Mackenzie said: \"I think there is a determination to get something done on this one. Representations I have had are that occupied properties are being downvalued by these properties being unoccupied. I do have sympathy with what people are saying.

A letter to tenants notes a marked increase in the costs of maintaining properties so that they can be re-let.Detailed surveys of some empty properties in Meiklefield Road have shown the properties \"are structurally sound, but that they will require considerable investment over an extended periodthey are to remain in lettable condition\".The letter says tenants will be kept in the loop: \"Your views will help us to decide on a future approach to investment in the estate.\"To give your views, contact Mandy Macleman, tenant participation and customer engagement officer, on   or mandy.macleman@highland.gov.ukFriday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It has taken many years to reach this pointand is much needed.I wonder what,any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building  If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion George DicksonI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisationof a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep itfor the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.I also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last  years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.Some parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability..."},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"Marc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move.

But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1077173.jpg--.jpg?1539084908000\n","title":"public mystified by disappearing planters","story":"LOCAL people have been mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church. Council simply said they are now being stored at a Council yard.Meanwhile people have also been concerned as to the whereabouts of the original town centre bandstand.The plan for this was for it to be re-established in the Peoples Park, however this has not yet happened.When thecontacted Council for a statement, they said: “We are delighted with the success to date of Harmony Hub – our borough’s newest and state-of-the-art outdoor entertainment venue.“Harmony Hub has showcased a wide range of talented local artists since it opened earlier this year and we look forward to welcoming more great performances and attractions.Speaking about the original bandstand, the Council confirmed they have plans for it.“The old bandstand was carefully dismantled so it can be preserved and relocated to the People’s Park.“We are currently working on plans for this installation and more information will be made available in due course.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1065046.jpg--.jpg?1538637007000\n","title":"tension in chamber over gaa dinner","story":"AN INVITE for councillors to a GAA gala dinner stoked up tensions in the Council chamber last week.A request from St Ergnats GAC to invite members of Mid and East Antrim to the Tullyglass on November  was read to members.It followed an item on the agenda with members being invited to a gala dinner in support of NI Childrens Hospice.Members had agreedthey were to attend the hospice dinner that they would purchase their own tickets.When the GAA dinner was raised Councillor Carson proposed to mark it as read as the club was not located in the Mid and East Antrim boundary lines.However Councillor Declan OLoan said the club was located in Moneyglass which fell very close to the border and that a lot of players at the club lived within the Mid and East Antrim Borough.He added: This is an outstanding club like many others in the area who raise a lot of money and doesnt depend on its council for support.I would propose we do the same for this as we are doing for the hospice.Councillor Gaston seconded Councillor Carsons proposal to mark the invitation as read.If anyone wishes to attend this they should go in their own capacity.Councillor Maguire added that the issue of location of the club should not come into the decision.He added: If I remember correctly some members of this Council attended a dinner in Lurgan or Portadown for the British Legion so that set a precedent.I would second what Councillor OLoan has said and treat this invite similar to that of the hospice dinner.Councillor Gaston added that both invitations were completely dferent.The Northern Ireland Hospice does sterling work and is for the benefit of people all over Northern Ireland.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics.

But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School.

Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism.

A second officer with responsibility for Ulster-Scots, sign language and other languages has also been appointed.The posts are jointly funded by Belfast City Council and Foras Na Gaeilge.The announcement was made during an event in City Hall presenting research by Conradh Na Gaeilge and the Committee on the Administration of Justice into how the north’s  councils are complying with their obligations with regard to the Irish language.Speaking at the launch Chief Executive of Belfast City Council Suzanne Wylie said: “I am absolutely delighted to be here today to celebrate the Irish language officers scheme and to welcome our Irish Language Officer Colm Mag Uiginn.“We also have our Irish Language Pfficers from Fermanagh, Omagh, Derry and Strabane here as well. It’s also great to see representatives from the Irish language community here today.“This council, earlier on this year under a dferent Mayor, launcheda five-year language strategy and we are now seeing the practical out-workings of that strategy including the appointment of the Irish Language Officer.“On behalf of myself and the other councils who have benefited from this scheme we thank Foras Na Gaeilge for this initiative.”Ms Wylie added: “Languages are something to be celebrated. Belfast has a close association with the Irish language, many of our place names are taken from Irish language whether it’s Béal Feirste, Bóthar na bhFál or Bóthar na Seanchille, Belfast heritage has got an enduring relationship with the Irish language going down centuries.“I think in many ways Irish speakers in Belfast were pioneers. Today we acknowledge the Irish language community here, in this city and across the north.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"festival frolics to cheer us up","story":"THE announcement by Teesie May on the eve of the Tory conference that there’s to be a Festival of GB and OWC in  has, not surprisingly, split the Pravince down the middle. On the one side are those who think that an orgy of union jack-waving to the strains of Land of Hope and Glory is an excellent idea on the other side are those with a titter of wit.Squinter can recall two similar Ulsterfests in his letime, both of them when he was a youngster. The most recent one was the queen’s  silver jubilee, when Britain vos celebratink der th anniversary von der coronation von Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Loyal Ulster being loyal Ulster, it ended up cheering loudest and, West Belfast being West Belfast, we decided to celebrate the auspicious occasion with a non-stop summer of rioting as a result of which Squinter’s right arm remains sore to this day.The earlier one was the rather creepy and sinister ‘Ulster ’’ – a celebration of  years of partition that was held on land between Botanic Park and the Stranmillis Embankment. The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch . Which might make a bit more sense."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"johnnies havent missed the boat insists mcnulty","story":"ST JOHN’S and Cushendall lock horns again this Sunday at Ballycastle two weeks on from their thrilling drawn semi-final in Dunloy.Cushendall battled back from being five points down in the closing stages to take the lead following a late free from Neil McManus. Yet, Ciaran Johnston had the final say on proceedings to nail a free under intense pressure and in the face of a strong cross-field wind. As the underdogs, some may feel that St John’s had their chance the first day as favourites have a habit of winning replays. However, St John’s manager Tony McNulty sees it dferently and has urged his side to make to most of Sunday’s second chance to reach the county final. “We just took our foot of the pedal in the last few minutes. I said before the game that we had to play for  or  minutes and we only played for  minutes,” said McNulty. “We were four or five points ahead late on and we just switched off. “We switched off long enough for them to get their goal and it was nervous at the end. While we scored to draw the game, we felt we had done enough to win the game. “We’ll not be going into this match thinking we’ve missed the boat. “When Neil McManus hit that free I though “here we go again” – thankfully Ciaran Johnston stepped up and scored his free. We were disappointed having led not to hold on.“We can’t afford to switch off again – Cushendall are too good. When you have players like Neil McManus, Arron Graffin and Alex Delargy, we can’t afford to. I can’t see there being much in the game again this Sunday.” McNulty also gave his views on the worrying scenes which marred the end of the match when two Cushendall supporters jumped over the wire at Dunloy to confront the St John’s players in the dying minutes of the game. With such incidents in the spotlight in recent weeks, the intruders could have sparked a much more serious flashpoint, but order was soon restored. While McNulty condemned the actions of those involved, he feared the game might have been brought to a premature end with his side one point in arrears at the time. “There was a bit of carryon at the sideline which had nothing to do with us,” reflected McNulty “The ball was in among four or five Cushendall men and one of their players pulled on it.“He hit his own player and one of our players. It resulted in a bit of pushing – nothing serious. “Two of their supporters jumped over the wire. “I don’t know why, but they started throwing punches until the players got them off the pitch. “I was glad the referee continued the game and gave us the chance to equalise and thankfully the people were identied.” It is believed that the Cushendall player who was struck by his own teammate was Antrim ace Eoghan Campbell, who is likely to miss Sunday’s replay as a result of the hand injury sustained late in the drawn encounter. St John’s will also be without one of their leading players for the remainder of the campaign after attacker Donal Carson departed for Australia last week, but Simon McCrory is expected to be fit to play a greater role in the replay having played the second half in the drawn game. “Donalis away to Australia so that’s a big blow for us,” added McNulty. “I don’t know what happened, but there was something about the dates and he couldn’t get them changed. “It is unfortunate because he has been playing well for us. “In nearly every game, he has scored a goal for us. If Campbell is out for them, it evens things up a bit. “Simon McCrory should be good to go. He is a super player for us and he has been outstanding in every game he has played this year. He wasn’t right for the last game. All being well, the two-week break will do him good.” McNulty will also have the task of lting the dual players in the club following their semi-final football defeat at the hands of Creggan last Sunday. Senior finalists in , the Johnnies were edged out - to - by Kevin Madden’s men at Glenavy, but McNulty, whose son Ryan is a key member of both squads, doesn’t think the dual players will suffer any hangover from that defeat. “We are disappointed, but we have to hang in,” stated the Johnnies boss. “We didn’t play as well as we can do on Sunday, so we can have no complaints. “Things conspired against us on the day. Simon McDonagh’s we went into labour on Sunday morning so he was unavailable. Peter McCallin wasn’t back from holiday in time. “We had six or seven dual players in action on Sunday who will feature again this weekend. “They’ll lt themselves up alright. “It would have been great to going into the match trying to reach two senior finals, but we have to focus on Sunday’s game now.” With Division One winners and  champions Dunloy out following their surprise loss to Loughgiel, the remaining sides will all fancy their chances of lting the Volunteer Cup later this month. The Shamrocks will get a chance to view their final opponents over the course of  minutes in Ballycastle on Sunday, but it would come as no great surprisean additional  minutes was required to separate St John’s and Cushendall."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"roisins relief as decision to deny pip is overturned","story":"THE delighted father of West Belfast woman Roisin McWilliams has spoken of his relief after his daughter’s PIP knockback was overturned.Last month the Andersonstown News spoke with Tom McWilliams in his Twinbrook home as he told us the heartbreaking story of his -year-old daughter’s courageous battle with stage  Hodgkin#s lymphoma and how the mother of one was refused PIP on the grounds that she could cook for herself, administer her own medication and plan a journey.An emotional Tom said yesterday: “It was such a relief to us as a family to find out that Roisin’s PIP decision had been overturned and she would also be awarded money owed, this has taken a lot of pressure off her and we can now focus on the future and getting her well again.”Last week Roisin also got more news she was waiting for – funding for her new immune therapy treatment has been granted and she underwent her first session in recent days.Tom said: “I have no doubt that the media pressure surrounding Roisin’s case has helped and I want to thank each and every single person who has taken the time to wish us well and support us.

It added: \"This had been caused entirely by the behaviour of the respondent and this behaviour was motivated by age discrimination.\"Mr Matiers claim was supported by the Equality Commission.Mary Kitson, senior legal officer at the Equality Commission, said: \"This case is an important reminder to all employers not to make generalised assumptions about people on grounds such as age, which are protected by anti-discrimination law.\"It is unlawful under the Employment Equality Age Regulations of  for any employer to discriminate on grounds of age in the arrangements they make when offering employment.\"The tribunal in its finding noted that Mr Matier \"was, in effect, given no opportunity on the grounds of his age\".

It would see the UK match EU trade tarfs temporarily in order to avoid a hard border when the UK leaves the European Union. Ms McDonald echoed previous sentiments by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that a time-limited backstop isnt acceptable. \"That is not an option - one of the real tests for the backstop is that it is not temporary,\" she said.\"The challenges presented to Ireland by Brexit are not temporary or fleeting, the protections afforded to this island must be robust and enduring. Anything that is time-limited does not represent the backstop that we need.\"Just bear in mind that when the backstop was first landed on, the Taoiseach assured people that Ireland had been protected, it was watertight, that it would ensure that peoples rights would be protected in an enduring way. \"Time limits are not acceptable, in fact I would render any arrangement null-and-void.\" Speaking before the partys meeting yesterday with the Taoiseach and the Tanaiste Simon Coveney, Ms McDonald said they would discuss Brexit and the current power-sharing impasse at Stormont. She said: \"At the end of the last Dail session, we were told there would be renewed efforts at talks to re-establish the Assembly. \"Its now October, there is no process, there is only stalling and excuses, people in the North are anxious to have their rights respected and legislated for. \"The DUP is in hiding at Westminster, their agreement with the Tories means that they are not willing, nor have been pressured to do the things necessary, to ensure we have government again in the North.\"Speaking in the Dail ahead of his meeting with Sinn Fein, Mr Coveney said: \"There is no firm agreed position on the Irish backstop from the two negotiating teams thats agreed yet anyway.\" He continued that the vast majority of text of the withdrawal treaty had been agreed, but that the last -% was proving dficult and that it mostly involved Ireland. Mr Coveney added: \"The DUP are a very important voice in Northern Ireland but they do not represent a majority there.\" He said that while the DUP had a special relationship with the British Government, the Irish Government had a relationship with all political parties in Northern Ireland.

The court witnessed grown men and women weeping openly as they relived their experience at your hands.“You have materially affected the lives of so many of your former pupils for whom you were responsible as their teacher.

There is an ongoing investigation and it would be premature of me to comment until we see the final results of the investigation.”A Turkish newspaper published the names and photographs of  Saudi nationals who allegedly arrived in Istanbul on two private jets the day Mr Khashoggi went missing.On Wednesday, the Sabah newspaper, which is close to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, revealed the identities of what it called a “mysterious” -member “assassination squad” who were allegedly involved in the disappearance.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A security guard at the entrance of Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul A critic of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Mr Khashoggi was living in self-imposed exile in the US and writing opinion pieces for the Washington Post before he vanished.He visited the consulate last Tuesday to obtain a document confirming he had orced his ex-we, in order to allow him to remarry.Turkish officials have said he was killed on the premises and his body removed.Mr Erdogan has not confirmed the alleged killing, saying he would await the result of an investigation.Saudi officials have denied the allegations as baseless.Sir Richard said he would be suspending his directorship of two tourism projects in the country on Thursday, while Virgin would halt discussions with the Saudis over investment in its space projects.He warned thatfears are confirmed, the West would struggle to continue doing business with the Gulf kingdom.He said: “What has reportedly happened in Turkey around the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,proved true, would clearly change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi Government.”"},{"url":null,"title":"this lower league spanish sides new kit is inspired by the circulatory system","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction. He permitted a Down Recorder photographer to visit the scene and had no objections to the crime being publicised.HOLLYWOOD mdash The widely-held belief that Hollywood actress Greer Garson was born and bred in Down District has been scotched.

It is turning into death-trap with dficult turning circles that intrude on pedestrians and oncoming traffic, she explained.ldquoThe meeting with roads officials took place at .am so they were able to see the situation for themselves with everybody having to demonstrate nimble footwork, ing out of the way of oncoming traffic.Cllr Enright said the pavement currently ran only half way up Racecourse Hill and the road was not wide enough for two-way traffic.ldquoRoads officials have agreed to a one-way system which will allow vehicles to drive down the hill when a new pavement is in place. Traffic calming measures will also be provided to ensure vehicles do not race down the hill.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It has been thought until now that the scheme had been largely fixed in November  and the RHI Inquiry has spent much of its time examining the allegation that DUP figures delayed those changes, allowing hundreds of people to pile into the scheme.However, yesterday the inquiry was told that evidence from the Department for the Economy shows that although the  changes had improved the scheme, they did far less to protect public money than had been previously thought.The  changes introduced tiered tarfs which meant that after a boiler ran for , hours the subsidy level dropped massively - something which ended the unlimited ‘burn to earn’ situation which existed before then.However, they did not involve a more complex cost control known as degression, which operated in the GB scheme.And alongside the move to tiering Stormont also doubled the size of boiler eligible for the most lucrative tarf.That meant that claimants under the revised scheme installed far bigger boilers so that they were able to produce considerable heat and be paid at the highest subsidy level.Figures provided to the inquiry show that boilers were on average running for % of the time before the changes. But after the change, usage - albeit with boilers able to produce double the heat in the same time - dropped to %, the level at which the most lucrative tarf dropped.However, counsel for the inquiry David Scoffield QC said that payments made per unit of heat had dropped only marginally from .p to .p.Dr McCormick agreed that the changes had proved to be a limited budgetary control, although he said that they had at least “stopped the unlimited use” of boilers.He said that the decision to double the size of boilers for the most lucrative tarf at the same time as attempting to rein in the scheme “was not as clearly analysed and scrutinised as it should have been”.He accepted that the failure to understand that the scheme was still very generous gave a  sense of security that spending on the scheme was under control and “the worst of it is dealt with”, but that now seemed “very questionable indeed”. produced the email to Timothy Johnston \"   produced the email to Timothy Johnston \"  RHI Inquiry: Mystery over DUP Spads’ emailSammy Wilson: DUP is not bluffing over threat to Theresa May Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Dr McCormick also accepted that a power to suspend the scheme should have been included in , something which would have stopped the second spike in applications.Dr Keith MacLean put it to him that although the introduction of tiered tarfs had addressed the issue of wasteful heat, “the heat that is being produced is costing the taxpayer pretty much the same that it did before”.Dr MacLean went on to say that the department’s business case which argued that the scheme was value for money in an attempt to retrospectively get approval for irregular spending on the scheme “seems to have been a work of complete fiction”.try catch     .               ..

email to Timothy Johnston  Last Thursday, counsel for the inquiry Donal Lunny told an evidence session at which Mr Johnston was testying that late the previous night the inquiry had been given an email by another former DUP Spad, Timothy Cairns, which showed signicant contact between them on RHI.The email appears to have been supplied because it contained a reference to another green energy scheme, the NIRO, which the inquiry had belatedly requested DUP Spads search their email accounts for references to.However, the email also contained a reference to “renewable heat”, meaning thatit was in the possession of either the DUP, Mr Johnston or Mr Cairns prior to that point it ought to have been disclosed.The inquiry has now published the email, showing that it was sent from Mr Cairns’s DUP.org.uk email address to Mr Johnston – who has told the inquiry that he also used an email address on the DUP server, rather than a departmental email, for government business.If the email remains on the DUP server, that would mean that the party should have disclosed it, evenneither of the two men now have access to it.The News Letter asked the DUP why it had not handed over the email before nowit was in the party’s possession, whether the party had establishedit had other material that may not have been handed over and who within the party had been responsible for giving documents to the inquiry. The party declined to comment, saying that the inquiry was still in process.Mr Cairns, who no longer works for the party, was asked why he was only submitting the email now and whether he was aware of the party having access to his old emails.He said: “I have been advised by my solicitor to respond as follows: The inquiry process is ongoing.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
