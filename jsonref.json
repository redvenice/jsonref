When he outgrew that and was being sent for slaughter, Manor Farm stepped in. ‘He’s a rascal,’ says Di. ‘Having been given lots of attention, he feels it’s his right to demand fuss from visitors, who are taken by surprise when he head-butts the back of their knees!’          Bullied pig called Simon: Partially-sighted and with deformed front legs, Simon was so terribly bullied by the bigger pigs he shared a sty with at another rescue centre that they asked Manor Farm to take him. ‘He was grossly overweight which didn’t help with his movement problems — if he was a human it’s like he’s walking on his wrists,’ says Di. ‘He’s now lost weight and is enjoying life with his friend Brooke. She chivvies him around all day and I give him strawberries and melon which he loves.’          Jack the VERY stroppy Donkey: Jack was the first non-hen to be taken in by Manor Farm rescue sanctuary after it came into being about seven years ago. ‘We bought the land for it with some money left to me by my Uncle Jack,’ says Di, ‘so when a donkey sanctuary asked me to look after a donkey called Jack it seemed meant to be. The only thing is — he’s nothing like my Uncle Jack who was very gentle whereas donkey Jack is quite stroppy!’Less than a decade ago, Di and Alan were both running businesses from their Nottinghamshire village home.Now they’re also running an animal sanctuary that currently cares for more than 100 farmyard creatures. And not just any creatures. They take in the ones no one else wanted, rejected because they were disabled, had health problems, special needs or simply grew too old.Or, in the case of the many rescued from petting zoos, simply because they grew up. ‘People imagine these animals are living a lovely life in the petting zoo until they die naturally,’ says Di, ‘but that’s not so in the majority of cases.Adorable moment Limbani the chimpanzee shrieks with joy and...Fury at female Kentucky hunter who posted sickening photos...Share this article‘Lambs can be bred out of season to be Christmas attractions to be bottle-fed by visitors but once they’ve grown out of the cute stage, they go into the food chain.’What’s more, they often come to her emaciated, neglected and infested with parasites. Then the battle is on to save their lives. That battle costs Manor Farm Charitable Trust up to £100,000 a year — around a fifth of which are vets’ bills.‘Our vets are constantly challenged by the ageing of our animals,’ Di admits.No wonder — it’s rare farmyard creatures live more than a year or two before going to be slaughtered.          Blind Stevie\u0027s a littler wonder: When blind Stevie the Mallard duck came to Manor Farm, they knew he needed a friend to guide him round. ‘I chose a girl called Wanda,’ says Di, ‘because female ducks are louder than the boys and I believed he needed someone noisy to follow around.’ Stevie was found with big scabs over his eyes. ‘We didn’t know at first if he’d been attacked, if they were infected or even if he had eyes. He did — but he was blind.’ Now Wanda’s his guide duck.          Toothless OAP fed on a banana: Life’s left Dolly so scared of human strangers that when summer comes Di can’t call in a shearer —instead she has to do it herself with nail scissors. Dolly, a breeding nanny at a farm park, came to Manor Farm in 2012 when they started neglecting her because she’d become barren. ‘She barely had the strength to hold her head up,’ says Di. ‘But she had an indomitable spirit we could all do with.’ Dolly, who has no teeth, was fattened up with mashed banana and is now in the equivalent of her 90s.          Stumble, duck who live up to his name: Stumble may only have one leg but he’s still the scourge of the female ducks he shares his enclosure with. ‘He’s perfected the ability to jump on to a mate,’ says Di. ‘They all run but they can’t hide from him. Stumble’s leg had to be amputated after getting caught in fishing wire. He’s had a difficult summer because he’s moulted and lost his tail feather and wing tips — which help keep him stable. So he keeps falling over.’ And falling in love.          Goat that costs £3,000 to perk up: Of all the Manor Farm animals, Jo cost the most. So thin when Di rescued him from a petting zoo that he couldn’t hold his neck up, she nursed him back to health in her kitchen. ‘He came up to me as if to say “help me,” ’ she says. Jo was covered in lice and had digestive problems. ‘We nearly lost him several times — he was always the one needing the vet at midnight,’ says Di. But she doesn’t begrudge a penny of the £3,000 he cost. ‘He’s the sweetest creature,’ she says.But it’s not just the vets who have been learning. Di has too. ‘In 2010 I treated myself to four hens as a reward for completing an MA in creative writing and I found it was a slippery slope ,’ she says.A year later, a relative died, leaving her money to buy the six-acre field behind the house. Slowly the brood grew and the dozen or so enclosures now house 64 hens, 27 goats, two donkeys, one pony, two pigs and 30 sheep.Di now employs a full-time member of staff and three part-timers. Every day begins at 6am when she gets the feed ready. It ends at 10.30pm — earlier in winter — when she puts the animals to bed. She also finds time to run her publishing business (and Alan his marketing consultancy firm) which help bankroll Manor Farm.          Ewe with a stiff neck: Born with a twisted neck, Hilda was too deformed to breed and too skinny to slaughter so Di took the tiny ewe in. \u0027We were told she\u0027d never take to humans,\u0027 she eat out of a trough because she\u0027d never seen them before. But within a month she was letting us touch her and gradually she got a lust for life. Now she loves to be cuddled and her tail wags madly like a big dog          A goat the size of a pony: Ronnie, the Anglo Nubian goat, is the size of a Shetland pony. ‘They’re a large breed but he’s a particular giant,’ says Di, ‘and that’s how he ended up here — his elderly owner couldn’t cope with the size of him and was going to have him shot.’ So she did a 135-mile round trip to save him. ‘I knew he was big but even so it was a bit of a shock when I saw him.’Other money comes from corporate and personal donations and the sale of eggs and wool from the animals online. Apart from cash worries, there are other downsides. ‘I’ve had every injury known to man — I’ve lost a nail to a goat horn, been electrocuted by a fence and accidentally injected myself with goat antibiotics,’ says Di.But this pales into insignificance compared to the pain of losing one of their beloved creatures. The sanctuary is full so it’s only with the death of an animal that another can be saved. They come from farm parks, via social media or from other rescue centres.‘It is hard work,’ says Di, ‘but when you see the sheep feeding on the grass and the goats happy in their enclosure, it’s worth it.’          Hen healed in a roasting tray: Buffy the ex-battery hen was doing perfectly well at Manor Farm when she was sat on by another bird and left with a bruised back last winter. ‘One of my biggest joys was that we got Buffy back to health with daily physio,’ says Di. ‘Although I do feel a bit guilty that we kept her in a roasting tray so she could rest her neck on the edge of it. She’s still a bit stiff and walks with a bit of a goose step but is otherwise fine. And she now loves cuddles — every time you pass her she wants you to pick her up.’          Sheep who need a dentist: Dumpy is easy to spot: his teeth have grown so big, his jaw is deformed. ‘But you really couldn’t meet a sweeter sheep,’ says Di. She saved him from the slaughterhouse last year — he was on a trailer bound for it when the farmer’s daughter put out a social media appeal. ‘We all clubbed together to buy him and the farmer said we could have him — as long as we gave the money to Comic Relief,’ says Di. But those teeth keep the dentist busy.Manor Farm Charitable Trust | Lifelong sanctuary for livestock in need"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/01/4DC0BF0100000578-5911421-Rebekah_Vardy_pictured_at_England_s_game_against_Belgium_has_bee-a-42_1530577904871.jpg","title":"World Cup WAG thinks her","story":"    Flying the flag: England striker Jamie Vardy\u0027s wife RebekahHer sharp-shooting husband could fire England into the World Cup quarter-finals tonight.But as the nation holds its breath, striker Jamie Vardy\u0027s wife Rebekah is hogging as much of the limelight as she can – claiming her husband\u0027s success is partly down to her.The 36-year-old reality TV star has been doing media interviews almost daily while in Russia with her family.She has also been sharing pictures online of her time with other WAGs, boarding private jets and going on extravagant shopping trips, as well as the inevitable glamorous matchday selfies.Estimates suggest 20million people will watch the game on TV in Britain tonight and 36million pints of beer are expected to be drunk across the country today – 17million in pubs and 19million at home.The British Beer and Pub Association also predicted £25million would be spent on food in pubs today and £30million on meals eaten at home.Meanwhile, the National Grid expects electricity demand to spike by 700 megawatts at half-time – equivalent to 27million fridge doors opening at the same time as fans grab another beer.The grid\u0027s director of system operations Duncan Burt said: \u0027We\u0027ll balance supply and demand second by second in real time.\u0027Rebekah Vardy (pictured at England\u0027s game against Belgium, left, and on social media, right) has been doing media interviews almost daily while in Russia with her family and sharing pictures online England face Colombia at 7pm in the 45,000-seater Spartak Stadium in Moscow, with around 4,000 of their fans thought to have travelled to Russia. Mrs Vardy will be there too of course, cheering the team – and herself – on.She claimed yesterday the national side had prospered thanks to the presence of their loved ones.Kim Kardashian proves she IS a Beyonce fan as she bops along...Love Island: Megan cements viewers\u0027 opinions that she is a...Love Island: Georgia is left RAGING as Josh re-couples with...Adorable moment Limbani the chimpanzee shrieks with joy and...Share this articleShe said coach Gareth Southgate has helped get the most out of the players by allowing them time alone with their families and friends, unlike during previous tournaments.She told The Sun: \u0027He\u0027s got the right idea of the team mentality.

One young relative was recently born with an extra urinary tract.Her husband had suffered such a high dose of radiation to his head he went on to have chronic headaches which led him to kill himself in 1976.Eric and Shirley had already had one daughter together before he was involved in the experiment. She was born healthy.However, 37 per cent of their descendants from children born after Eric passed through the radiation cloud were born with defects or unexplained medical conditions.These included skull deformities, missing or extra teeth and spinal problems.          The MoD continues to deny that Eric and his crew were subjects of an experiment, despite the emergence of new papersTwo of his four children with Shirley were born with abnormalities, as were some of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.RAF hero Eric was involved in early tests into the radiation caused by atomic and hydrogen bombs.In 1958 he was stationed in the Pacific Ocean on Malden Island and Christmas Island - the site of Operation Grapples, which saw the UK carry out some of its earliest nuclear weapons tests.Eric was ordered to fly his Canberra B6 bomber through a cloud left in the wake of a 2.8 megaton nuclear explosion on April 28, 1958, documents reveal.X-ray badges were stuck to his seat to measure the barrage of radiation as he and two others entered the cloud.They were placed behind his head, on both armrests and by his groin.The documents reveal \u0027care was taken to ensure as little shielding effect as possible\u0027 was given to the X-ray badges. Of course, this meant Eric and his crew became vulnerable to the deadly radiation.The document was an Atomic Weapons Establishment paper looking at ways of testing the badges to make sure they were accurate.They detail the exact amount of radiation absorbed by the head, arms and groin and the bomber\u0027s pilot, navigator and wireless operator.They also note the time spent inside the cloud, the height of the plane and the time the bomber entered the cloud after the bomb detonated.The documents goes on to set out the pros and cons of the badges in measuring radiation. They also suggest re-running the experiment with more badges.          One of the documents showed Flight Lieutenant Denson recorded a radiation reading of 13 Roentgens after carrying out the flightWhen Eric\u0027s bomber touched down after the test he began to experience vomiting and developed a rash - common symptoms of radiation poisoning.The documents, written by scientists running the experiments, show that Eric, who was 24 at the time, had his head exposed to 65 years\u0027 worth of normal ­background ­radiation.This amounted to 17,500 dental X-rays worth of radiation during just six minutes of flight.The badge placed near Eric\u0027s groin recorded a dose of 8.8 Roentgens - about 30 years\u0027 worth of background radiation.In total he received 18.8Rs, the worst of the three-man crew which flew that day.Shirley is seeking an apology from the Ministry of Defence, who have insisted veterans were not used as guinea pigs during nuclear tests."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/09/4DDEDC4900000578-0-image-a-11_1530606342861.jpg","title":"Toddler gets hand jammed lift playing doors mother watches on","story":"    The boy\u0027s mother was standing right next to him when he got his hand trapped in the lift\u0027This is like Mao¿s China\u0027: Piers Morgan compares schools...Eddie Mair hits back at reports he left the BBC after...Trump threatens WTO, saying the U.S. will respond if it...Remains of burial horses from 2,700 years ago are found in...Share this articleThe boy was seen playing with the buttons and jumping around in the lift prior to the accident, with his mother standing right next to him.She did not appear to stop him playing  in the lift.The toddler then placed his right hand on the doors and they suddenly opened, taking his hand into the side panel with it and snagging his fingers. The desperate mother immediately squatted down and tried to pull her son\u0027s hand out but his fingers remained firmly jammed between the lift wall and the door, which was half open.   The boy was seen playing with the buttons and jumping around in the lift prior to the accident          The desperate mother immediately squatted down and tried to pull her son\u0027s hand out but his fingers remained firmly jammed between the lift wall and the door, which was half open  A passer-by rushed to their aid while the mother repeatedly pressed the alarm buttonA passer-by rushed to their aid while the mother repeatedly pressed the alarm button.Chinese net users have blamed the mother\u0027s apparent negligence for the accident. \u0027This mother does not deserve sympathy,\u0027 one said. \u0027She should take full responsibility of being a poor parent.\u0027\u0027She should take this as a lesson,\u0027 another said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/09/4DDF0F2B00000578-0-image-m-8_1530608396884.jpg","title":"Boardmaster Festival medics ignored teenagers pleas help","story":"    Pictured: George Zographou tragically died after contracting meningitis b A teenager died after festival medics failed to pick up on the signs of meningitis and left him on a tent floor in a coma.George Zographou, 18, was shaking and vomiting but doctors told his parents his illness wasn\u0027t serious with his mother asked to pay for a taxi to take him to hospital.But the sixth form student went into cardiac arrest on the tent floor and died days later in hospital.He had only just completed his A levels at a well-regarded college in his home city of Bristol. A government report released yesterday revealed how George\u0027s pleas for help fell on deaf ears. He arrived at the three-day music event in Newquay, Cornwall, last August and immediately fell ill.The youngster had not been drinking alcohol and spent the first night in his tent being sick with cramps in the back of his legs. He could only crawl on his hands and knees, the report read, and was not able to walk without help.   Security teams called the medics, who took him to the tent on a buggy.

The youngster had not been drinking alcohol and spent the first night in his tent being sick with cramps in the back of his legsHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised to George\u0027s parents and also the family of Izzy Gentry, who also died after her meningitis was not diagnosed quickly enough. The report intends to raise awareness about the deadly illness and help medical staff and volunteers at festivals and mass gatherings to be able to recognise the signs  early. Izzy was only 16 years old when she was sent home from the Bristol Royal Infirmary with gastroenteritis instead of meningitis. The coroner ruled her death had been contributed to by neglect.After meeting the families, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised and commissioned the report, which makes 12 recommendations. It includes listening to parents, better care at festivals and more awareness to the illness.          Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised to George\u0027s parentsIzzy complained of headaches and not feeling well. There had been a meningitis case two weeks earlier at St Brendan\u0027s Sixth Form College, where both she and Geroge were pupils.Izzy developed a high temperature, became lethargic and soon started vomiting and developed neck and limb pain.She was taken by ambulance to the BRI, with paramedics warning of potential sepsis and meningitis.At triage, the doctor made an initial examination and diagnosed her with gastroenteritis, sending her home with fluids and painkillers, making no reference to meningitis.At home, she worsened and suffered a fit, and she was rushed back to hospital. Izzy fell unconscious by the time she got to A\u0026ampE and doctors said it was serious and she was taken into intensive care. Less than half an hour later, she was diagnosed with meningitis.Izzy was stabilised, but her condition got worse and her organs shut down. An inquest concluded her death had been contributed by neglect.The report made 12 recommendations, including asking all medical staff and volunteers at festivals to to know the signs of meningitis.Those staff and volunteers need to checked through by the Care Quality Commision (CQC) and communication also needs to be improved.The working group also wants Public Health England to review its leaflets on vaccinations and meningitis. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/10/4DDDA49E00000578-5912687-image-a-6_1530608740782.jpg","title":"Greek athletes olive oil traditional wrestling rivals hands rivals trousers","story":"    Each one-on-one battle can take from five seconds, to up to 40 minutes including added time, depending on strategy and tactics. The best way to succeed is to avoid the slippery torsos, and aim for fellow competitors’ trousers, called kismet          Limbering up before going onto the grassed wrestling zone, these competitors have already been covered in olive oil for the traditional event, which dates back two millennia. Oil wrestling is believed to be the closest to ancient Greek wrestling in style. However, in ancient times, the Greeks would have competed naked, as they did in all sports          Bare torso, and with bare feet, this wrestler is donning thick trousers made of calfskin leather. Some wrestlers also wear jeans. The trousers the men wear are made of thick leather in a traditional design called kisbet. In recent years manufacturers have changed from traditional buffalo to calfskin. While durable, sometimes they are torn apart in the fighting          Wrestlers covered in olive oil fight in an annual traditional oil wrestling competition in the northern Greek village of Sochos. Muscular men walk around the lawn, which is turned into a wrestling ring, to the tune of traditional music, with their torsos slathered in olive oil for the yearly festival that blends the traditions of ancient Greece and more modern times          Fights take place simultaneously in a large field, and unlike most combat sports there is no set field or arena. The wrestlers are free to roam around as the fight takes them, and are typically followed by a referee. Unlike Greco-Roman wrestling, which relies heavily on technical ability, oil wrestling is more a test of endurance          In tears: a wrestler covered in olive oil reacts after taking part in an annual traditional oil wrestling competition in the northern Greek village of Sochos. The oil makes it harder for the wrestler to grip opponents, so this type of combat needs a certain strategy, besides strength, to succeed          Oil wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world, which dates back to the ancient city of Babylon but is still practiced across Turkey and in northern parts of Greece. There is no score in the event. The winner is the man who manages to throw his opponent onto the ground so that his shoulders touch the soil          Prior to the matches, wrestlers cover their bodies in olive oil as they prepare to compete in the event. It is not unusual for competitors to oil one another, above, to show mutual respect. The traditional sport of oil wrestling in Greece has continued from generation to generation          Spectators watch as wrestlers covered in oil take part in an annual traditional oil wrestling competition, in the northern Greek village of Sochos. Fights take place simultaneously in a large field, and unlike most combat sports there is no set field or arena. The wrestlers are free to roam around as the fight takes them, and are typically followed by a referee          Wrestled to the ground: the annual event promotes and spreads the sport of wrestling, with spectators, including tourists, watching as competitors test each participant\u0027s strength and skills. Unlike in boxing, isions in oil wrestling do not only take into account weight, but also age and track record - meaning there is often little similarity in physiques between competitorsJudy Murray says tennis faces its own #MeToo moment because...Dramatic pictures capture the moment a tourist who floated...Share this article"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/10/4DDED29A00000578-5912749-image-a-32_1530610162081.jpg","title":"The ULTIMATE Grand Designs","story":"    This £30million mansion in Maidenhead, which boasts views of Windsor Castle, has been shortlisted for an international design award voted for by the public and is up against properties in the US, South Africa and the Caribbean          The UK property, pictured, has been nominated in the \u0027Modern Masterpiece\u0027 section of the HGTV Ultimate House Hunt competition and it comes with its own art gallery, a huge dining hall and a games pitch          Pictured are the stables at the property, which also comes with a horse track and a games pitch to make it a very attractive proposition while there is also a huge polo arenaThe competition is a joint venture between Leading Real Estate Companies of the World and Luxury Portfolio International.Of the finalists the most expensive property is a £30million manor in Maidenhead which boasts its own polo grounds and views of Windsor castle.Listed among the other finalists is a serene hideaway in the Hamptons in New York, a penthouse in the Johannesburg skyline, a Caribbean Island retreat.ROBERT HARDMAN: For 100 years, Binns (known as the Harrods...Would you turn this beautiful period property into your own...Householder is forced to put duct tape on his windows to...Share this articleStephanie Anton, President of Luxury Portfolio International, said: \u0027Modern architecture is really having its moment with today\u0027s affluent home buyer. \u0027Marked by distinct characteristics such as clean lines, bold cantilevers, large windows and minimalist style, we continue to see incredible demand for Modern around the world.\u0027As the selection of homes in this category reflect, this style is equally at home in a beautiful countryside or a city setting.\u0027           Another of the properties on the shortlist is this modern design in Hollywood, California, set in the hills that comes with a host of amenities including a bar, wine room and sculptures          The Hollywood home gives great views of the Los Angeles skyline thanks to its hillside location while many of the walls are made from glass, also enhancing the view and giving it a sleek design          Another of the US homes nominated is this \u0027haven in the Hamptons\u0027 in New York, which again features windows instead of walls around much of the property.

This year’s Wimbledon Championships could have one of the hottest days everChief Meteorologist, Will Lang, said: ‘The heatwave conditions will continue to affect pretty much all parts of the UK over the next few days.‘Although peak temperatures may not be quite as high as we have seen this week, we will still see temperatures widely in the mid to high 20’s  with 30C or more still possible across southern and some central parts of England.’However, that is still a few degrees short of the hottest temperature recorded in the UK.That honour goes to Faversham in Kent in 2003. On August 10, the hottest ever temperature in the UK was recorded there, hitting a mighty 38.5C.The summer of 2003 was an incredibly hot one, with Scotland’s Greycook recording 32.9C one day earlier. It was the hottest temperature ever recorded in Scotland until June 28, 2018.That summer wasn’t the hottest overall, however. That title goes to the summer of 1976, where for 15 days towards the end of June, temperatures in all four nations topped 32C and Cheltenham recorded 35.9C at the start of July.In Dorset and Devon, no measurable rain fell for a staggering 45 days, which led to the passing of the Drought Act and water rationing.It is thought that temperatures will climb over the next two weeks, hitting 33C in the first week of July before potentially topping 35C next week.Dr Thomas Waite of PHE of Public Health England said: ‘It’s vitally important that we keep an eye on friends, family and neighbours who may be at risk.‘For others, the best thing to do is avoid the sun during the hottest parts of the day, carry water with you when travelling and if going out to large events, and we know lots of people will be watching football this week: think what you can do stay cool.’See here for more information on how hot the weather has to be for school and work to get cancelled. What is Cheryl\u0026#8217s surname following her split from Liam Payne?Heatwave 2018: When was the UK\u0027s hottest summer on recordWho is Morgan Evans?

When he outgrew that and was being sent for slaughter, Manor Farm stepped in. ‘He’s a rascal,’ says Di. ‘Having been given lots of attention, he feels it’s his right to demand fuss from visitors, who are taken by surprise when he head-butts the back of their knees!’          Bullied pig called Simon: Partially-sighted and with deformed front legs, Simon was so terribly bullied by the bigger pigs he shared a sty with at another rescue centre that they asked Manor Farm to take him. ‘He was grossly overweight which didn’t help with his movement problems — if he was a human it’s like he’s walking on his wrists,’ says Di. ‘He’s now lost weight and is enjoying life with his friend Brooke. She chivvies him around all day and I give him strawberries and melon which he loves.’          Jack the VERY stroppy Donkey: Jack was the first non-hen to be taken in by Manor Farm rescue sanctuary after it came into being about seven years ago. ‘We bought the land for it with some money left to me by my Uncle Jack,’ says Di, ‘so when a donkey sanctuary asked me to look after a donkey called Jack it seemed meant to be. The only thing is — he’s nothing like my Uncle Jack who was very gentle whereas donkey Jack is quite stroppy!’Less than a decade ago, Di and Alan were both running businesses from their Nottinghamshire village home.Now they’re also running an animal sanctuary that currently cares for more than 100 farmyard creatures. And not just any creatures. They take in the ones no one else wanted, rejected because they were disabled, had health problems, special needs or simply grew too old.Or, in the case of the many rescued from petting zoos, simply because they grew up. ‘People imagine these animals are living a lovely life in the petting zoo until they die naturally,’ says Di, ‘but that’s not so in the majority of cases.Adorable moment Limbani the chimpanzee shrieks with joy and...Fury at female Kentucky hunter who posted sickening photos...Share this article‘Lambs can be bred out of season to be Christmas attractions to be bottle-fed by visitors but once they’ve grown out of the cute stage, they go into the food chain.’What’s more, they often come to her emaciated, neglected and infested with parasites. Then the battle is on to save their lives. That battle costs Manor Farm Charitable Trust up to £100,000 a year — around a fifth of which are vets’ bills.‘Our vets are constantly challenged by the ageing of our animals,’ Di admits.No wonder — it’s rare farmyard creatures live more than a year or two before going to be slaughtered.          Blind Stevie\u0027s a littler wonder: When blind Stevie the Mallard duck came to Manor Farm, they knew he needed a friend to guide him round. ‘I chose a girl called Wanda,’ says Di, ‘because female ducks are louder than the boys and I believed he needed someone noisy to follow around.’ Stevie was found with big scabs over his eyes. ‘We didn’t know at first if he’d been attacked, if they were infected or even if he had eyes. He did — but he was blind.’ Now Wanda’s his guide duck.          Toothless OAP fed on a banana: Life’s left Dolly so scared of human strangers that when summer comes Di can’t call in a shearer —instead she has to do it herself with nail scissors. Dolly, a breeding nanny at a farm park, came to Manor Farm in 2012 when they started neglecting her because she’d become barren. ‘She barely had the strength to hold her head up,’ says Di. ‘But she had an indomitable spirit we could all do with.’ Dolly, who has no teeth, was fattened up with mashed banana and is now in the equivalent of her 90s.          Stumble, duck who live up to his name: Stumble may only have one leg but he’s still the scourge of the female ducks he shares his enclosure with. ‘He’s perfected the ability to jump on to a mate,’ says Di. ‘They all run but they can’t hide from him. Stumble’s leg had to be amputated after getting caught in fishing wire. He’s had a difficult summer because he’s moulted and lost his tail feather and wing tips — which help keep him stable. So he keeps falling over.’ And falling in love.          Goat that costs £3,000 to perk up: Of all the Manor Farm animals, Jo cost the most. So thin when Di rescued him from a petting zoo that he couldn’t hold his neck up, she nursed him back to health in her kitchen. ‘He came up to me as if to say “help me,” ’ she says. Jo was covered in lice and had digestive problems. ‘We nearly lost him several times — he was always the one needing the vet at midnight,’ says Di. But she doesn’t begrudge a penny of the £3,000 he cost. ‘He’s the sweetest creature,’ she says.But it’s not just the vets who have been learning. Di has too. ‘In 2010 I treated myself to four hens as a reward for completing an MA in creative writing and I found it was a slippery slope ,’ she says.A year later, a relative died, leaving her money to buy the six-acre field behind the house. Slowly the brood grew and the dozen or so enclosures now house 64 hens, 27 goats, two donkeys, one pony, two pigs and 30 sheep.Di now employs a full-time member of staff and three part-timers. Every day begins at 6am when she gets the feed ready. It ends at 10.30pm — earlier in winter — when she puts the animals to bed. She also finds time to run her publishing business (and Alan his marketing consultancy firm) which help bankroll Manor Farm.          Ewe with a stiff neck: Born with a twisted neck, Hilda was too deformed to breed and too skinny to slaughter so Di took the tiny ewe in. \u0027We were told she\u0027d never take to humans,\u0027 she eat out of a trough because she\u0027d never seen them before. But within a month she was letting us touch her and gradually she got a lust for life. Now she loves to be cuddled and her tail wags madly like a big dog          A goat the size of a pony: Ronnie, the Anglo Nubian goat, is the size of a Shetland pony. ‘They’re a large breed but he’s a particular giant,’ says Di, ‘and that’s how he ended up here — his elderly owner couldn’t cope with the size of him and was going to have him shot.’ So she did a 135-mile round trip to save him. ‘I knew he was big but even so it was a bit of a shock when I saw him.’Other money comes from corporate and personal donations and the sale of eggs and wool from the animals online. Apart from cash worries, there are other downsides. ‘I’ve had every injury known to man — I’ve lost a nail to a goat horn, been electrocuted by a fence and accidentally injected myself with goat antibiotics,’ says Di.But this pales into insignificance compared to the pain of losing one of their beloved creatures. The sanctuary is full so it’s only with the death of an animal that another can be saved. They come from farm parks, via social media or from other rescue centres.‘It is hard work,’ says Di, ‘but when you see the sheep feeding on the grass and the goats happy in their enclosure, it’s worth it.’          Hen healed in a roasting tray: Buffy the ex-battery hen was doing perfectly well at Manor Farm when she was sat on by another bird and left with a bruised back last winter. ‘One of my biggest joys was that we got Buffy back to health with daily physio,’ says Di. ‘Although I do feel a bit guilty that we kept her in a roasting tray so she could rest her neck on the edge of it. She’s still a bit stiff and walks with a bit of a goose step but is otherwise fine. And she now loves cuddles — every time you pass her she wants you to pick her up.’          Sheep who need a dentist: Dumpy is easy to spot: his teeth have grown so big, his jaw is deformed. ‘But you really couldn’t meet a sweeter sheep,’ says Di. She saved him from the slaughterhouse last year — he was on a trailer bound for it when the farmer’s daughter put out a social media appeal. ‘We all clubbed together to buy him and the farmer said we could have him — as long as we gave the money to Comic Relief,’ says Di. But those teeth keep the dentist busy.Manor Farm Charitable Trust | Lifelong sanctuary for livestock in need"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/01/4DDCC7E200000578-5911597-image-m-35_1530578206565.jpg","title":"Anything bear ter Bouncing bear copies kids enjoying playtime St Louis Zoo","story":"    Grizzly bears aren’t known for being playful, but this beautiful bear at the St. Louis Zoo sure knows how to have a good time          St. Louis native Suzanne McIver captured incredible footage of children playing with one of the zoo’s grizzly bears          The kids jumped around the viewing area, and the grizzly began to bounce along with themThe little girl crouched down on the floor before springing up and waving her arms in the air.The bear watched closely before he too took a leap out of the water in a similar way.It wasn\u0027t long before her brother got excited and wanted in on the action.He attempted to get the bear\u0027s attention by knocking on the glass and jumping up and down.The bear once again reenacted the child\u0027s movements and began to bash his paws on the side of the glass. The video was all captured by St. Louis native Suzanne McIver who decided to film her children on a recent visit to the exhibit. Fury at female Kentucky hunter who posted sickening photos...\u0027We go with the flow!\u0027 Canadian couple converts a $5,000...Share this article    At one point it looked as though the little boy and the bear were really getting along well  The girl crouched down on the floor before springing up with her arms outstretched          The bear continued to mimic the actions of the children for several minutes in the exhibit"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/13/4DE031FF00000578-5912373-image-m-33_1530622726259.jpg","title":"Allies Jacob Rees Mogg sound PR firms Tory leadership bid","story":"    Allies of Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured) apparently sought advice from PR experts on how to exploit the Brexiteer\u0027s cult following among activists  Theresa May (pictured in meeting Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte in the Hague today) faces a potentially decisive battle with her own Cabinet over future relations with the EUWhile stopping short of totally ruling out a bid today, Mr Rees-Mogg pointed out that since the 1920s the Conservatives in government had always chosen a former chancellor, home secretary or foreign secretary.Pressed in a podcast for the ConservativeHome website on whether he would put his name forward, he replied: \u0027There isn\u0027t a contest.

One young relative was recently born with an extra urinary tract.Her husband had suffered such a high dose of radiation to his head he went on to have chronic headaches which led him to kill himself in 1976.Eric and Shirley had already had one daughter together before he was involved in the experiment. She was born healthy.However, 37 per cent of their descendants from children born after Eric passed through the radiation cloud were born with defects or unexplained medical conditions.These included skull deformities, missing or extra teeth and spinal problems.          The MoD continues to deny that Eric and his crew were subjects of an experiment, despite the emergence of new papersTwo of his four children with Shirley were born with abnormalities, as were some of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.RAF hero Eric was involved in early tests into the radiation caused by atomic and hydrogen bombs.In 1958 he was stationed in the Pacific Ocean on Malden Island and Christmas Island - the site of Operation Grapples, which saw the UK carry out some of its earliest nuclear weapons tests.Eric was ordered to fly his Canberra B6 bomber through a cloud left in the wake of a 2.8 megaton nuclear explosion on April 28, 1958, documents reveal.X-ray badges were stuck to his seat to measure the barrage of radiation as he and two others entered the cloud.They were placed behind his head, on both armrests and by his groin.The documents reveal \u0027care was taken to ensure as little shielding effect as possible\u0027 was given to the X-ray badges. Of course, this meant Eric and his crew became vulnerable to the deadly radiation.The document was an Atomic Weapons Establishment paper looking at ways of testing the badges to make sure they were accurate.They detail the exact amount of radiation absorbed by the head, arms and groin and the bomber\u0027s pilot, navigator and wireless operator.They also note the time spent inside the cloud, the height of the plane and the time the bomber entered the cloud after the bomb detonated.The documents goes on to set out the pros and cons of the badges in measuring radiation. They also suggest re-running the experiment with more badges.          One of the documents showed Flight Lieutenant Denson recorded a radiation reading of 13 Roentgens after carrying out the flightWhen Eric\u0027s bomber touched down after the test he began to experience vomiting and developed a rash - common symptoms of radiation poisoning.The documents, written by scientists running the experiments, show that Eric, who was 24 at the time, had his head exposed to 65 years\u0027 worth of normal ­background ­radiation.This amounted to 17,500 dental X-rays worth of radiation during just six minutes of flight.The badge placed near Eric\u0027s groin recorded a dose of 8.8 Roentgens - about 30 years\u0027 worth of background radiation.In total he received 18.8Rs, the worst of the three-man crew which flew that day.Shirley is seeking an apology from the Ministry of Defence, who have insisted veterans were not used as guinea pigs during nuclear tests."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/09/4DDEDC4900000578-0-image-a-11_1530606342861.jpg","title":"Toddler gets hand jammed lift playing doors mother watches on","story":"    The boy\u0027s mother was standing right next to him when he got his hand trapped in the lift\u0027This is like Mao¿s China\u0027: Piers Morgan compares schools...Eddie Mair hits back at reports he left the BBC after...Trump threatens WTO, saying the U.S. will respond if it...Remains of burial horses from 2,700 years ago are found in...Share this articleThe boy was seen playing with the buttons and jumping around in the lift prior to the accident, with his mother standing right next to him.She did not appear to stop him playing  in the lift.The toddler then placed his right hand on the doors and they suddenly opened, taking his hand into the side panel with it and snagging his fingers. The desperate mother immediately squatted down and tried to pull her son\u0027s hand out but his fingers remained firmly jammed between the lift wall and the door, which was half open.   The boy was seen playing with the buttons and jumping around in the lift prior to the accident          The desperate mother immediately squatted down and tried to pull her son\u0027s hand out but his fingers remained firmly jammed between the lift wall and the door, which was half open  A passer-by rushed to their aid while the mother repeatedly pressed the alarm buttonA passer-by rushed to their aid while the mother repeatedly pressed the alarm button.Chinese net users have blamed the mother\u0027s apparent negligence for the accident. \u0027This mother does not deserve sympathy,\u0027 one said. \u0027She should take full responsibility of being a poor parent.\u0027\u0027She should take this as a lesson,\u0027 another said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/10/4DDED29A00000578-5912749-image-a-32_1530610162081.jpg","title":"The ULTIMATE Grand Designs","story":"    This £30million mansion in Maidenhead, which boasts views of Windsor Castle, has been shortlisted for an international design award voted for by the public and is up against properties in the US, South Africa and the Caribbean          The UK property, pictured, has been nominated in the \u0027Modern Masterpiece\u0027 section of the HGTV Ultimate House Hunt competition and it comes with its own art gallery, a huge dining hall and a games pitch          Pictured are the stables at the property, which also comes with a horse track and a games pitch to make it a very attractive proposition while there is also a huge polo arenaThe competition is a joint venture between Leading Real Estate Companies of the World and Luxury Portfolio International.Of the finalists the most expensive property is a £30million manor in Maidenhead which boasts its own polo grounds and views of Windsor castle.Listed among the other finalists is a serene hideaway in the Hamptons in New York, a penthouse in the Johannesburg skyline, a Caribbean Island retreat.ROBERT HARDMAN: For 100 years, Binns (known as the Harrods...Would you turn this beautiful period property into your own...Householder is forced to put duct tape on his windows to...Share this articleStephanie Anton, President of Luxury Portfolio International, said: \u0027Modern architecture is really having its moment with today\u0027s affluent home buyer. \u0027Marked by distinct characteristics such as clean lines, bold cantilevers, large windows and minimalist style, we continue to see incredible demand for Modern around the world.\u0027As the selection of homes in this category reflect, this style is equally at home in a beautiful countryside or a city setting.\u0027           Another of the properties on the shortlist is this modern design in Hollywood, California, set in the hills that comes with a host of amenities including a bar, wine room and sculptures          The Hollywood home gives great views of the Los Angeles skyline thanks to its hillside location while many of the walls are made from glass, also enhancing the view and giving it a sleek design          Another of the US homes nominated is this \u0027haven in the Hamptons\u0027 in New York, which again features windows instead of walls around much of the property.

As the Pompidou holds a retrospective, the 93-year-old veteran of street photography praises the power of the instant‘I am coming!” Sabine Weiss shouts as she descends from her studio to greet me. At 93, the Swiss-French photographer is immaculately presented and immediately comes across as a force to be reckoned with – holding court in her Lilliputian home and studio that nestles in a plant-filled courtyard hidden behind a row of 19th-century apartment buildings, in Paris’s wealthy 16th arrondissement.The photographer and her late husband, the American painter Hugh Weiss, built the diminutive structure themselves, gradually converting a disused sculpture workshop measuring 5m x 5m into a place to live and work. This incongruous dwelling – home to Weiss for the last 69 years – proudly endures, much like its inhabitant, despite its perpetually changing backdrop. Hugh found the place in 1949, she says, through a connection in a Montmartre paintshop. “He told me, ‘It has no running water and only an outside toilet – it’s perfect!’” She laughs. “But we were happy. That is the most important thing, no?”Weiss is the last living member of the postwar humanist school of photography that includes such luminaries as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Doisneau, Brassaï and Willy Ronis. Weiss objects to this classification, however, claiming her work is too varied to be reduced to a single historical moment, one that’s synonymous with the mid-century emergence of black-and-white street photography and photojournalism.Born in 1924 in the Swiss-French border town of Saint-Gingolph, Weiss bought her first camera, a cheap Bakelite model, with her pocket money at the age of eight and soon began developing her own film. She knew, before she had even left school, she was going to be a professional photographer. “At the time,” she says, “the idea of being a professional photographer was inconceivable. There were no books, no exhibitions. Maybe there were books in the States for very well-known photographers, but not in Switzerland.”Weiss’s circumstances were somewhat unusual. Her father was a skilled chemical engineer who encouraged his daughter’s aptitude for the technical processes of photography, helping her set up her own dark room in the family home, where she taught herself such techniques as salt-paper and silver-gelatin printing. “My family thought I would be a lab technician,” she says.Weiss completed two lengthy apprenticeships: the first with Studio Boissonnas in Geneva, renowned for its advanced photo processing the second with the German fashion photographer Willy Maywald, after she moved to Paris in 1946. Maywald was a master with lighting, says Weiss. In her three years with him, she learned techniques that would prove critical to her later remarkable versatility as a photographer.The largest exhibition of Weiss’s street photography to date – entitled Les Villes, La Rue, L’Autre – has just opened at the Pompidou Centre in Paris. It consists of images Weiss made mostly for her own enjoyment. “They are my secret garden, my spiritual nest egg, my personal intimate memory.” She never expected to see them in an exhibition, but enjoyed working with the curators. “They have picked some I would not have chosen.”As I sit with Weiss, poring over a lifetime’s work spread out on her coffee table, she has the air of someone who has seen much and regrets little. While many of her mostly male peers pushed their practice as an art form – Cartier-Bresson often insisted he was engaging in drawing or painting by other means – Weiss viewed her image-making as its own craft and embraced the label of photographer.She distinguished herself through sheer range, travelling continuously, photographing for the New York Times, Newsweek, Life, Vogue, Elle, and undertaking commissions for large institutions, notably Nato. But she also did advertising and fashion photography. “My skill, when I began working for myself alone in Paris, was that I already had a lot of experience. I had seven or eight years of photography behind me. When somebody asked me for a picture story – or for advertising, portraits, all kinds of things – I was able to do it.”Unlike Doisneau and Brassaï, Weiss’s street photography and reportage was never staged. “All the pictures I take are entirely instant,” she says. “What I like is to make an instant picture. Even if there are no people, I like the click, click, click. I never wait.”Weiss often had to carry heavy equipment, including multiple cameras, lenses and filters. She also routinely worked with children and animals. “In all these shoots I was alone,” she says. “I was outside in the park looking for babies. I was asking people to make me a glass bubble for one campaign, a wardrobe for another. I had also once to find a suit of armour, all sorts of things. Difficult sometimes, you know?” When I note that she seems equally proud of the photographs she produced for advertising as she is of her street photography, she agrees: “Yes, because sometimes they were very challenging technically.”Weiss has always been ambivalent about being included in exhibitions, viewing print publications as a perfectly suitable showcase. Remarkably, she didn’t even attend her first solo show of 55 photographs at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1954, writing to its curator to say she had too many work commitments in Paris. Nor did she see the celebrated 1955 MoMA exhibition The Family of Man, curated by Edward Steichen, for which the famous photographer travelled to Paris from New York to select three of her photographs.“This was when we still had no running water and I didn’t have a proper darkroom,” says Weiss. She has a simple explanation for her lack of interest in art world recognition: “I didn’t need to have exhibitions. My husband was a painter and he had to show his work. But I was working with all the magazines and they sent me copies, proof that I have done the work. I could see what I have done.”Weiss also concedes that she was too busy to go socialising with her photography peers in Paris and didn’t care to participate in all the mid-century theoretical discussions surrounding photography. These ideas were generated largely by the publication of Brassaï’s Paris at Night in 1933 – to which Henry Miller, Jean-Paul Sartre and other artists and thinkers responded – along with Cartier-Bresson’s The Decisive Moment. In this landmark 1952 publication, Cartier-Bresson outlined his preference for instant photography and dubbed himself “the velvet hand” with “the hawk’s eye”.Perfectly balanced compositions are undoubtedly Weiss’s great strength, but perhaps less well known is her remarkable ability to establish immediate connections with her subjects, no matter how fleeting the encounter. The warmth of her photographs is striking, particularly when compared with the sometimes clinical coldness of Cartier-Bresson’s street photography.Nowhere is Weiss’s ease with people more evident than in her black-and-white shots of children playing in the streets of 1950s Europe and the US. When I ask Weiss to identify her favourite photograph, there is a short pause as she leafs through the pile of contact sheets and prints sitting on the table. She retrieves a black-and-white shot of what looks like a five-year-old boy wearing only a threadbare pair of shorts and pretending to be a horse. The child is staring directly into the camera and is surrounded by his friends, who are looking at him with awe and delight. “I like this picture because he is playing with me,” she says. “He is showing me he is a horse.”Yet Weiss was equally adept at producing classic portraits of celebrated artistic figures, including Samuel Beckett and Joan Miró. She was friends with Alberto Giacometti, having met him in Geneva as a young woman, and photographed the artist, his studio and his work on multiple occasions.She once put a Giacometti sculpture into the back of her car and asked her husband to drive her and their eight-year-old daughter, Marion, to a lake in nearby Bois de Boulogne, where she wanted to photograph the artwork. Weiss placed the sculpture at the edge of the lake and then returned to her camera, put her head beneath the cloth – and suddenly heard a large splash, which terrified her. I expect her to tell me the sculpture had been destroyed, but she laughs and quickly says: “Luckily, it was only Marion. She climbed out of the water covered in tiny little worms!”• Sabine Weiss: Les Villes, La Rue, L’Autre is at the Pompidou Centre, Paris, until 15 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ccf8539ce2e447bdcb694638265dca13fff0738/69_262_4754_2854/master/4754.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9deec1b88e3a9ce2a4f21cf9cbcf3db6","title":"global visions the 49th arles photography festival in pictures","story":"Robert Frank, Laura Henno, and Feng Li are featured at this huge event exploring everything from African spirituality to marriage in China and death in Ukraine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb3bc6ff75fb68f17b155ab72571cf993e7a3ff2/620_304_2865_1719/master/2865.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9351f1be6a1d82618f0e9dfdbedaa5c0","title":"kpmg faces frc watchdog investigation over conviviality audit","story":"Accountancy watchdog announces investigation after collapse of drinks companyKPMG is being investigated by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) over its audit of Conviviality, the owner of Bargain Booze which collapsed earlier this year.The accountancy watchdog said it had begun investigation into KPMG’s preparation and approval of the drinks company’s financial statements for the year ended April 2017.Conviviality fell into administration on 5 April this year resulting in its drinks wholesale and retail businesses being sold off to separate parties.The collapse of the once-respected stock market firm came after three profit warnings in as many weeks, the first of which was blamed on an arithmetical error by a member of the finance team. A week later, Conviviality revealed it had also discovered a £30m tax bill for which it had not budgeted.The investigation comes after KPMG was singled out by the industry regulator in a report that concluded the overall quality of the audit profession was in decline.

No longer dusty, provincial versions of Las Vegas, these municipalities would become innovative makers of lithium-ion batteries for electric cars and partners in Elon Musk’s vision of a clean-energy revolution.That was the pitch. These days many residents in Sparks – a sunbaked, low-rise city of 100,000 people located 20 miles from the factory – express humbler dreams: food, shelter, health care.“I’m not used to living this way,” said Katherine Pope, 69, a retired administrator who rents a small motel room and relies on food donations. “I can’t afford to move. Many times I can’t afford meat.” Another impoverished resident, a 70-year-old unemployed transcriptionist with a thyroid condition, faces a recurring dilemma. “Food or medicine, it’s one or the other.” A rent increase may soon compel another grim choice: sleep in her battered 1997 Saturn or in a homeless shelter.Down by the Truckee river you find others who feel cast out – families who have moved into trailer parks, which are packed to capacity, and people sleeping rough. “A year ago I was the caretaker of an apartment building and my wife was a caregiver. Then I lost my job. We couldn’t afford to rent anywhere so now we live here,” said Kevin McCullough, 48, who like his partner, Pixie, was sunburnt from outdoor living. Home is a tent by riverbank reeds.Such testimony conflicts with the official narrative that Sparks is booming – awash with jobs, money and newcomers. But you hear it from a largely hidden underclass which is paying a price for the boom. Some have a term for it: “Tesla’d.”One complaint is that tax credits given to Tesla – and to a lesser extent other tech companies – deplete public services, resulting in potholed roads, overcrowded schools and insufficient affordable housing.The other is that the tech worker influx has sent rents rocketing, tipping residents on fixed incomes, especially seniors, into penury.That was not the pitch in 2014 when Nevada beat rival bids from California and New Mexico to land the Gigafactory. It did so with exemptions from sales-and-use, property and general business taxes for 10 to 20 years, adding up to an estimated and unprecedented $1.4bn. The previous record, to lure an Apple server farm, was $88m. Brian Sandoval, the Republican governor, hailed the deal as transformative for a region still limping from the great recession. Today the factory sits behind a fenced swath of desert known as the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC), which also hosts Google, Switch and Panasonic, among others, and bills itself the world’s biggest industrial park.Tesla’s “alien dreadnought” – Musk’s words – dominates. It is unfinished but already produces around 3,000 battery packs per week for Tesla’s Model 3 sedan. Thousands of workers and contractors have moved to Sparks and nearby communities, a boon for local hotels, landlords, builders, plumbers, electricians, taxi drivers and other service providers.A Tesla spokesperson said the company was investing in local education, including a high school manufacturing development programme and a $37.5m plan to promote science, technology, engineering and mathematics.Tesla receives credits based on jobs created, Ron Knecht, Nevada’s state controller, said in an interview. “They’re reaching their benchmarks significantly faster than expected.”Current Tesla projections suggest the credits are justified even if the ultimate cost is unclear, said Knecht. “If it pans out the way it looks, it’ll certainly be good for the economy. The state may break even but we’ll never really know.”A Republican, Knecht’s job is to protect taxpayers’ money. Figures from his office, supplied under a mandate for transparency in corporate welfare, show how much tax abatements reduced potential revenues for local authorities in fiscal year 2017. In the case of Tesla it was $68.7m.Credits to Musk’s company will soak up most of a tax revenue excess Nevada was due to record this year.The state compensates local government, said Knecht. Had Tesla never come there would have been nothing to tax, so the costbenefit remains murky. “You can get numbers all over the place.”Here’s one number that applies to Sparks: zero.Stephen Driscoll, the city manager, said despite surging population growth and increased strain on police and fire departments and schools, his annual budget had increased from $65m to $70m in the past two years – about the level of inflation. “So I’m at net zero.”Critics of the system say there is no doubt who ultimately pays. “It’s the working stiffs,” said Bob Fulkerson, of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada. Schools in Washoe county, which includes Sparks, are overcrowded and deeply in debt, so much so that voters in 2016 approved a sales tax hike to help plug the gap. Even so, fresh budget cuts could eliminate bus routes for nearly 4,000 elementary and middle school students in an effort to save $550,000.Tesla, meanwhile, has sold $131m in tax credits to casinos thanks to transferable tax credits – the cherry on the cake used to lure Musk.“Corporate welfare is a way of life in these parts,” said Andrew Barbano, a veteran commentator. Ordinary people bore the brunt in the form of regressive sales and gas taxes and impoverished services, he said. “Nevada is addicted to hidden indirect taxes.”Robert Fellner, of the Nevada Policy Research Institute, said politicians had warped incentives. Rather than create a fair tax system and balanced growth they wanted to be able to point at giant factories and say “we did that”. Jenny Brekhus, a city planner and member of Reno city council, said Nevada could not afford corporate welfare. “I don’t believe you can be a low tax, low service state and play this economic development game where you give away tax revenue.”In Sparks the result is a stark gap between winners and losers. Home owners have seen values soar – but not property taxes, which are capped. Plumbers, electricians and builders have bountiful job options. “The factory is a good thing,” said Omar Alvarez, 28, a building contractor who earned $18 an hour plus generous benefits at Tesla’s factory. “Well, as long as you actually work there.”Residents on fixed incomes, in contrast, are facing surging rents, driving some to destitution and the brink of homelessness. Trailer parks which were half-empty two years ago are now jammed, said Alicia Siever, who manages the River’s Edge RV park. Motels and shelters have also filled. “I get depressed. All humanity has left the area,” said Pope, who used to work in an architect’s office. Her $700 per month ground-floor motel room is a dramatic comedown from her previous apartments. “But I’m grateful this place exists.”The unemployed transcriptionist declined to be named lest identification sabotage her last-ditch attempt to avoid eviction. Asked to name unaffordable luxuries, she replied: “Ice cream. Bacon. A movie ticket.”A troubling question now hovers over Sparks. Is Tesla itself a winner or loser?Having bet on the Gigafactory, the city’s fate hinges on the company’s success, said Richard Daly, business manager of Laborers’ Union Local 169. “Growth problems are better than recession problems.”But a spate of setbacks – layoffs, achurn of executives, workplace safety complaints, “autopilot” car crashes and a suit against a whistleblower – has put pressure on the firm. “Giving so much to Tesla was risky,” said Eloy Jara, another labour leader. “If they fail it could really hurt.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1102e3f70ac6724fe7789b39bbbd3d1bdc38b446/0_71_3532_2120/master/3532.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f40bcffaff8a0aaa586fa40ff20b7692","title":"a women only private island is not empowering it is elitist","story":"A trip to SuperShe Island in the Baltic Sea costs £3,500. But the trend for exclusive networking groups aimed at wealthy women only sets back gender equalityOff the coast of Finland, immured in the Baltic Sea, there is a private island where men are banned and only a select few women, with suitably large bank accounts, are allowed to set foot. It is called SuperShe Island and it is the international headquarters of the SuperShe society.When I first heard about this women-only island, I thought – rather hopefully – that it might be a SuperSapphic version of Love Island. Desert Island Dykes, perhaps? No such luck. There is nothing filthy about SuperShe Island rather, it is all about the lucre. SuperShe, you see, is basically an upmarket networking group for well-off women. If you have €4,000 (£3,500) to spare and you are willing to undergo a rigorous interview, it offers you the chance to spend the week on a “wellness” retreat miles from men, mingling with other affluent, influential women.Before any men start getting indignant, I should make it clear that SuperShe Island is not the product of a man-hating mind far from it. As Kristina Roth, the founder of SuperShe, explains on the website: “Women need to spend time with other women. Being on vacation with men can cause women to become sidetracked, whether it’s to put on a swipe of lipstick or grab for a cover-up.”It was quite the education reading this I had no idea straight women were so easily distracted by putting on lipstick for men. It made me worry about heterosexual people.SuperShe Island also offers lots of yoga (it is basically illegal not to do yoga at upmarket retreats), organic food and various life-improving exercises, including cognitive exercises to expel negative thoughts. I would love to know exactly how these cognitive exercises work, because the more I read about SuperShe Island (it has had a ton of press lately – there is something about banning men that seems to get people interested), the more my brain was besieged by negative thoughts. What fresh faux-feminist hell is this, I wondered. Please tell me this is not yet another example of a newly minted women-only space painting itself as empowering when it is clearly elitist?I say “yet another example”, because there has been a boom in bouji spaces exclusive to women. There is the Wing, for example, a fashionable women-only co-working space and social club with locations across the US and a space in London on the way. Membership costs from $2,350 (£1,800) a year and there is a waiting list. Then there is the AllBright, an exclusive women-only members’ club in London that opened earlier this year and costs at least £975 to join. There is Women Fest, too, the UK’s first all-female festival, which is scheduled to take place in August. (It costs £225 to attend, but some of the profits will go to a tree charity, so I guess that is OK.) I could go and on, but you get the picture: the old boys’ club is being challenged.“Do you think I have big dyke energy?” I asked my girlfriend the other day. She looked me up and down and sighed. “Is this a Twitter thing? You really need to spend less time on Twitter, you know.”While it is true that I should spend less time on Twitter, the social network is also an invaluable source of useless information. Last week, for example, Twitter brought the concept of “big dick energy” into the national consciousness. A single tweet launched a thousand explainers in outlets ranging from the BBC to GQ to the . If you missed the column inches devoted to the concept, it basically means being hugely confident.But enough with the phalluses, please. Let’s talk about BDE 2.0, which is big dyke energy. The internet is yet to settle on an official definition of this, but it involves being comfortably self-assured without being cocky being confident without conforming to gender stereotypes. You don’t have to be gay to have big dyke energy, but you do have to challenge heterocentric norms about womanhood.Big dyke energy may sound like a throwaway internet joke, but trying to conceptualise what it means is a worthwhile exercise, because it gets you thinking about existing female tropes. There is the cool girl the crazy ex-girlfriend the old maid the Stepford wife the gold-digger the femme fatale the scorned woman the cougar the damsel in distress the ingenue and so on. When you start looking at how we categorise women, it quickly becomes apparent that most of these tropes revolve around men.What is great about the idea of big dyke energy is that it reflects a growing acceptance of women deriving their energy not from men’s approval, but from themselves.The political climate offers plenty of reasons to lie awake in a panic. But here is a new one: owls. I have always thought owls look evil, but I had never interrogated their malevolence. That changed when I watched a Netflix true-crime show called The Staircase and started reading about the murder trial it documents. You see, there is a theory that the woman who dies in The Staircase is the victim of an angry owl. While that may sound nonsensical, owl attacks are not uncommon. Indeed, last week, Iain Lee, a TalkRadio presenter, said he was viciously attacked by an owl. I don’t want that to prey on your mind, but please be careful out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/953835c316c305ad754bc54f07ec3f9cc2fba3e7/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2989bc072bb181f7d45c01e7329d9f56","title":"dear resistance marching is not enough","story":"The anti-Trump resistance keeps marching, and marching in record numbers, but what do the marches do, and what will take it take to win?This past weekend’s Families Belong Together demonstrations against Trump’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policies brought huge numbers of protesters out into the streets all around the United States for the fourth time this year. But what exactly does all the marching do, and how will it help the resistance win?There have now been well over 20,000 protests since Trump took office, according to data from the Crowd Counting Consortium, involving some 15 million participants, in every corner of the country. Until the Women’s Marches that kicked off the resistance in January 2017, the country had almost never witnessed coordinated protests in more than 200 locations in a single day over the last year and half, the resistance has broken this record time and time again. On 30 June, people marched against family separation and detention in more than 750 communities, from big cities like Chicago and Los Angeles to tiny towns like Antler, North Dakota, where 15 of the town’s 28 inhabitants turned out to take a stand.The numbers are impressive, but if anyone thinks that mobilizations like these will miraculously lead Donald Trump to do an about-face on any of his policies, they are in for a disappointment: change typically doesn’t happen that way.Mass marches in America, no matter how large, have almost never worked as short-term pressure tactics. Yes, the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act followed on the heels of the historic 1963 March on Washington, where Dr Martin Luther King Jr delivered his legendary I Have a Dream speech, but the influence of the march on the legislative victories was an indirect one. Mass marches function first and foremost as movement-building tactics, giving people an immediate bodily sense of being part of something larger than themselves, a palpable experience of collective power. They’re an antidote to despair, countering the sense of paralysis that can come all too easily when the news is as demoralizing as it has been. When marches are effective, it’s because they feed into longer-term strategies, strengthening people’s willingness to undertake the other kinds of work that produce concrete change. Until recently, the principal strategy of the grassroots resistance to Trump has been an electoral one: building toward the midterm elections, in the hope of electing a wave of progressives in November. At marches all around the country last weekend, people chanted “Vote, vote, vote!” and many participants redoubled their commitment to the essential but unglamorous work of making that happen. After her stunning upset victory last week in a New York Democratic primary, progressive candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reminded people of the labor-intensive door-to-door outreach it took to win, posting photographs on Twitter of her worn-out first pair of campaign shoes and writing: “Respect the hustle.” The horrors of forced family separation and the looming battle over the next supreme court nominee are leading many groups and iniduals to realize that a second kind of strategy is needed as well, a civil resistance strategy based on wide-scale non-cooperation, the kind that has been used all around the world to counter authoritarian regimes. Until recently, non-violent direct action was surprisingly rare under Trump, and small in scale relative to the numbers of people marching in the streets. That’s changing fast. Late last week, more than 600 women were arrested in a major direct action on Capitol Hill, a spirited protest that was three times larger than any women’s civil disobedience action in US history and by far the largest direct action under Trump. Participants and observers came away inspired and energized, and organizations that have long been leery of supporting anything but strictly legal forms of protest are suddenly exploring how they might contribute to stronger forms of resistance. Expect to see much more direct action in the weeks and months to come, from immigrant-led actions at the border to parent-led “playdate protests” at Ice facilities around the country to civil disobedience actions targeting politicians – both Democrat and Republican – who go along with Trump’s destructive agenda.Marching boosts morale, spreads a message, inspires bystanders, and even gives participants a taste of what it’s like to withhold political consent. But it matters most when it’s a first step toward other kinds of organizing. There will be no easy progressive victories under Trump, no magic successes just because we speak out. The millions who have marched over the last year and a half are moving in the right direction, but if we want to win, we’ll need to do much more than march."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8adb9a74210eff3e1769afba40e88db39a9aa301/0_23_2600_1560/master/2600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00756f8811eac93624f2db997baec39a","title":"fuel price rises broken tory promises brexit deal","story":"It’s been one of the most successful lobbying campaigns in modern political history, successfully erting billions from the Treasury with barely a squeak. But almost eight years on, it seems the campaign to freeze fuel duty has finally run out of road. The chancellor is now considering risking the combined wrath of white-van man, the Sun, and half his backbenchers by pushing up pump prices again, and while it’s ostensibly all to fund the NHS (the one thing for which prospective Tory voters will grudgingly pay more tax) that feels like only part of the story.If he hadn’t bitten this particular bullet now, Philip Hammond would have had to do so soon, because the nature of driving is changing. Assuming ministers are serious about wanting to phase out new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 for environmental reasons, fuel sales should tumble over the coming years as people switch to hybrid or electric models and that means revenue from fuel tax falling too. Even if Hammond just wanted to keep raising the sort of cash chancellors are used to raising from motorists, never mind raising more, logic suggests that either fuel duty will have to rise or he’ll have to find new and equally unloved ways of taxing drivers such as charging for road use. Perish the thought that, having been forced to conjure up £20bn from nowhere for the NHS, the chancellor might use that as cover for smuggling through a few overdue hard choices. But you can certainly see the temptation.Those cheering rising fuel taxes on the understandable grounds that reducing mileage could help save the planet need to be honest about how painful this will be for some. True, a measure portrayed as helping lower earners through a recession also quietly subsidised millions of drivers who didn’t need it half as much. But it’s ridiculous to pretend that everyone can now stop making unnecessary car journeys and cheerily take the Tube instead when millions live in places where public transport is either non-existent or expensive and unreliable, and when people on low incomes already think twice about every mile they drive. Wealthier motorists will probably grumble but carry on clocking up the miles, or else buy a hybrid. But poorer ones running cars they can’t afford to replace will have to prioritise getting themselves to work and the kids to school (no, they can’t always just walk, if parents themselves want to get to work on time) and cut back on pleasures such as driving to see relatives. Rising costs for hauliers, meanwhile, could translate into prices rising in shops just as Brexit starts to bite. There’s a strong green case for motoring taxes to rise as part of an eco-friendly package including measures to cushion drivers on low incomes, but how does that work if all the money’s going to the NHS?That it will is not, of course, a done deal yet. Some senior Cabinet ministers were thought to favour one simple measure that can be branded as an “NHS tax” – like Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s national insurance hike – and covers the cost in full, leaving wriggle room for bailing out other struggling public services from the proceeds of whatever growth Brexit allows. Prisons are busting at the seams, local government’s barely coping, and just because the defence secretary Gavin Williamson sounds like a latter-day Alan Partridge doesn’t mean the case for higher defence spending is completely without merit.Locked into the self-imposed straitjacket of her own manifesto, however, Theresa May is hardly spoilt for choice as to what that simple measure should be. The political fallout of breaking pledges on income and corporation tax made only last summer would be toxic, especially if that coincided with a Brexit deal falling horribly short of what leavers were promised. What’s utterly enraging, of course, is that it was so obviously irresponsible to make those promises in the first place: that pretending we can have world-class public services without paying a penny more wasn’t a lot more plausible than pretending we can leave the EU without losing any of the benefits. There’s a grim poetic justice, I suppose, in the government now being dragged kicking and squealing towards admitting that neither of those things is actually true. But don’t bank on it feeling either just or poetic to anyone on the sharp end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf618b5581afde05293019a4e222c62694b88a91/0_52_2352_1411/master/2352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc59d23dba8683137500f5af301eb14a","title":"theresa may solution brexit customs conundrum open europe","story":"As the UK exits the EU, it will leave the EU’s customs union. Yet with just months remaining of the article 50 deadline, the government still doesn’t have a clear customs policy. It has not endorsed either of Whitehall’s two existing options, which the EU has pre-emptively dismissed. Theresa May needs to break the impasse at her Chequers Brexit cabinet meeting.Meanwhile the Labour party and some Conservatives demand a new customs union with the EU. Together they may have a majority in parliament, although this has not been tested. Whatever Labour claims, a permanent customs union would mean outsourcing trade policy to Brussels (where we would no longer have a seat at the table), and allowing the EU to sell access to our markets without our control. That’s not a sustainable long-term position.On the other hand, some Brexiteers too readily dismiss the serious and legitimate concerns of business, especially those with supply chains crossing the continent. Equally, both the UK and EU have agreed that Northern Ireland’s unique circumstances require specific solutions to avoid a hard border.A few weeks ago, the Brexit cabinet refused to back May’s preferred option of a new customs partnership, which would mean the UK collecting EU customs levies. The alternative – maximum facilitation (“max fac”) – would have to work as part of a broader customs agreement with the EU and will reportedly not be ready by the end of the transition. A possible third way on customs is due to be discussed at Chequers, but will need to address concerns of business and the Irish border.After Brexit, EU goods trade will cross a customs frontier. If efficiently managed – as much global freight already is – declarations can be completed electronically before goods arrive. Currently just a tiny proportion of non-EU shipments are physically inspected. Future EU trade should be no different. Importers can use bonded warehouses and other schemes to help further alleviate friction, but problems will still need to be resolved.When the UK becomes what EU treaties define as a “third country”, Brussels would require regulatory checks to ensure imports comply with its rules. The non-partisan and independent policy thinktank Open Europe, which I am director of, has proposed ​ that the UK aligns with EU goods regulations (which many British industries will choose to do anyway). This would mean being a rule taker in those areas, but mutual recognition would allow goods to move freely with the EU. It seems likely that the government will endorse our plan at Chequers.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.A UK-EU trade deal would remove tariffs on goods, and matching rules should eliminate the need for regulatory checks. But the issue of rules of origin remains, which would also have to be checked. These require exporters to demonstrate the proportion of a product’s value that is local. If the proportion “originating” in the UK – made or transformed there – falls below an agreed floor, the product would no longer count for preferential trade.These rules of origin are intended to prevent unfair trading practice. The EU might worry that a future UK-US trade agreement could mean cheaper American car parts ending up in British cars, that then undercut European manufacturers. Rules of origin limits and checks won’t matter much for some product types or industries. But for companies with complex supply chains, they will be an important consideration as well as a potential source of disruption at the border.So for certain industries – cars and chemicals for example – the government could commit to matching some of the EU’s own external tariffs and relevant aspects of its trade policy for a time-limited period after Brexit. The purpose would be to achieve, in return, the most liberal and light-touch regime possible on rules of origin for those sectors.If the government chose to align tariffs in particular sectors, that would reduce opportunities to reduce domestic prices on those products. But the UK would be able to reduce tariffs in non-matched sectors.Future UK customs arrangements will rely on technology that is not yet operational. Reports yesterday that Eurotunnel is developing a new system to clear lorries automatically as they drive through its terminal are encouraging. But it seems likely that UK customs infrastructure will be not ready for the end of the standstill transition, given the government’s slow progress. On that basis it may be necessary, as I’ve already suggested, to remain in lockstep with EU customs policy for a little longer, then to liberalise aspects of our trade policy while agreeing to match specific sectors for a decade or so to help protect those industries.Some will worry that committing to match EU tariff levels on some industries would limit our ability to negotiate trade deals. But this compromise approach, which would work alongside other options to facilitate trade, is clearly preferable to a full customs union which would leave the UK tethered to all EU tariff lines or indeed to an unwieldily customs partnership. It might make sense in the longer-term to pursue general tariff liberalisation but with a hung parliament, and nervous businesses delaying investment, the government needs a way through on customs – and this might just be it.• Henry Newman is the director of Open Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1b46ad1d802673790dde190c665a5c6952fded/0_46_1935_1161/master/1935.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5589dc994ed8dfbfe98be942d860c2d","title":"botanical life in close up in pictures","story":"Colin Salter’s new book is a selection of extraordinary electron microscopic images of the plant world around us, including seeds, pollen, fruiting bodies, trees and leaves, flowers, vegetables and fruit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beab6d83e961fddb115ac532917ab358fcebde6d/1684_415_4111_2467/master/4111.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a52b82b6ae4f3c318809901c8e7563cb","title":"dani dyer love island reality stars turned actors","story":"Dyer is set to follow in her father’s footsteps towards low-budget British film stardom. But she should heed the warnings of Leona Lewis and Jedward …O31 won’t be the first film Dani Dyer has appeared in – she has previously been seen in fare like Age of Kill, We Still Kill the Old Way and Bonded by Blood 2 – but it will be the first film she’ll make as a newly minted Love Island star. By the time O31 comes out, she will be legitimately famous. Or at least, as legitimately famous as an ITV2 reality show contestant can be once the afterglow of Love Island has faded. Will anybody watch it? That’s harder to say. Dyer will play a woman who realises her brother killed her mum. According to its writer, O31 deals with: “race, politics, religion, homosexuality and how these are seen in society.” It doesn’t sound like a fun time.By all accounts, Dyer is in a tricky situation. Thanks to Love Island, she is more visible than she has ever been. But, thanks to Love Island, she’s going to have to work 10 times harder than every other actor if she wants to be taken seriously. Love Island is going to warp and taint her career for years. If she isn’t careful, all her roles will feel like stunt casting, trading off a quickly decaying moment of notoriety.When stars of reality shows make films, it is almost always a disaster. There is a reason why From Justin to Kelly (2003) is often singled out as the worst film ever made: it’s because it’s the worst film ever made a miscalculated attempt to leverage the winner and runner-up of the first American Idol series into something resembling a film career. Neither Kelly Clarkson nor Justin Guarini were actors. They had no chemistry. They could barely read lines. The film was a terrible, soulless contractual obligation for all involved. It contained a song entitled Chick-Seeking Missile but isn’t nearly as fun as that makes it sound.And From Justin to Kelly is only the tip of the iceberg. In 2014, X Factor winner Leona Lewis featured in Walking on Sunshine, a miserable little jukebox musical that made Mamma Mia! look like Tarkovsky. Jedward’s foray into cinema currently consists of three Sharknado movies and Keith Lemon: The Film. Despite studying at the Lee Strasberg Institute, Caggie Dunlop from Made in Chelsea has only managed a bit-part role – someone called Poodle – in a largely unseen film called The Hand of the Creator. Even Paris Hilton, at the height of her reality show infamy, could only scale the questionable heights of The Hottie and the Nottie, a real film that people actually paid money to make.Then there’s the example that Dyer will know most intimately. 2012’s Run for Your Wife was packed to the gills with non-actors, from Sarah Harding as a lead to cameos by everyone from Noel Edmonds to Rolf Harris, and it has comprehensively been called the worst British film of all time. She’d know, because she’s in it too, albeit in a minor supporting role.However, there are exceptions. Emma Stone, for example, got her first big break on a 2005 reality show called In Search of the Partridge Family – which aimed to cast the pilot for a remake of the beloved 1970s sitcom – and she went on to win an Oscar.So it can be done. Dyer should take comfort from this. If she works hard and makes sensible choices, she too can outpace the toxic orbit of reality television. Plus, she’s already made Run for Your Wife, so it’s not like her career can get any worse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f8435ce52bdcdb050452cdcaf1e17a17d5aa42b/0_146_4632_2779/master/4632.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5122fc23aac707ac86811b723d6d7587","title":"colombia fans world cup london elephant castle","story":"Events in Russia are followed closely in Elephant and Castle as tournament helps take minds off regeneration uncertaintyWorld Cup fever may slowly be gripping England supporters as Gareth Southgate’s side prepare to face Colombia in the last 16 but there is one corner of south London that will be fully behind the South Americans on Tuesday evening.Elephant and Castle has been at the centre of a thriving Colombian community ever since a large wave of immigration in the early 1980s as families attempted to escape conflict at home. A steady stream of students and families since then means there are estimated to be more than 40,000 Colombians living in the United Kingdom. The majority are based in the capital, with a large community also north of the river around Seven Sisters.Yet with several restaurants and bars including La Bodeguita – opened 12 years ago by Cali-born Diana Sach – situated around the much maligned shopping centre that was built in the 1960s, there is no doubt that “the Elephant” will be the place to watch the drama from Moscow unfold.“I will be getting here at 4.30 to make sure I can get a table,” says Pablo, a Colombian who moved to London in the 1970s. “We are all friends who have been coming for years. Many Colombian people live in different parts of London but like to come here because it is very exciting. It’s very important for the community.”Sach, having initially opened a kiosk selling traditional Colombian food in 1998, took the plunge when an Italian restaurant in the shopping centre vacated its premises and she and her two brothers moved in.“We were here 24 hours a day at the beginning and it was very hard work,” she says. “But it was great as we saw it gaining popularity. People now come from all over – if they have anything to celebrate, they come to us.”Recent regeneration of the area has resulted in plans to demolish the shopping centre, regularly described as one of London’s ugliest buildings, and there are fears that some independent businesses in the area could be forced out because of rising rents. The demolition has been delayed until 2019 but, despite the best efforts of Latin Elephant – a charity fighting on behalf of local traders – Sach admits she remains concerned over the future for her and the rest of the community.“We don’t know what is going to happen yet but we do know we want to carry on running a restaurant in Elephant and Castle,” she says. “La Bodeguita is my life but it is also a big part of so many other people’s lives here too.” visited La Bodeguita for Uruguay’s victory over Portugal in the last 16 on Saturday and there was no doubt whom patrons were supporting. Both of Edinson Cavani’s goals were greeted with loud cheers from supporters from Peru, Ecuador, Chile and, of course, Colombia. Around 400 are expected for Tuesday’s match, with confidence clearly running high after José Pekerman’s side recovered from losing their opening game to Japan.“I’m pretty sure we will win – we have a better team than England,” says Raul Alzate, who has lived in London for 25 years and whose nephew Steven Alzate plays for Brighton’s under-23s. “We’ve been in this country for a very long time, so I’m a bit torn actually. We usually support England as well! This time I have to support Colombia. It’s in my blood.”Much has been made of Southgate’s decision to field a weakened team in England’s final group stage match, with the defeat against Belgium ensuring they are now on the so-called “easier” side of the draw. They are third favourites with some bookmakers for the tournament after the elimination of Germany, Spain, Portugal and Argentina, although Raul insists Colombia will be no pushovers.“I can see it being a really good game,” he says. “But if England give them time on the ball, then they are in big trouble.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50c2be814bcbedba9e48b2f064607ad0609c1e78/0_10_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb37fec41ea043bf43c2e399c21b4551","title":"joachim low germany manager world up stay","story":"• Holders were eliminated in group stage at Russia 2018• Löw to see out contract until 2022Joachim Löw will continue as Germany’s head coach despite seeing his side eliminated during the group stages of the World Cup.The DFB confirmed on Tuesday that the 58-year-old, who signed a contract extension until 2022 in May, will remain in his post in spite of Germany’s shock exit in Russia, after defeats to Mexico and South Korea and a solitary win over Sweden.“I am very grateful for the belief that the DFB has shown in me and I feel, generally, that despite the justified criticism towards me, I feel a lot of support and encouragement too,” said Löw.“It was important for me, after a few days in which I did a lot of thinking, to sit down and have a one-to-one talk with the top of the federation.”“I am pleased that we can continue our long, successful path with Jogi Löw,” added the captain Manuel Neuer. “And I have the confidence that together we will regain our strength.”Löw has been in charge for 12 years, having taken over after the 2006 World Cup, and in he 2014 led Germany to their fourth World Cup title.

Years of knockout failures have taught the British press one thing: once England reach the last 16, don’t hold anything back. There are no second chances.A hitherto great World Cup tiptoed last night into new territory as Belgium’s knockabout victory over Japan, a second half of ludicrous entertainment and drama culminating in a last-second counter-attack of pace, grace, beauty and total ruthlessness, left viewers dangerously bloated on footballing excitement. Like Monty Python’s Mr Creosote we have gorged on too much already one more serving of such stimulation and we might literally explode. Happily, organisers have got this covered.The draw for the knockout stage was split into four quarters, both literally and thematically. One featured France, Argentina, Portugal and Uruguay and was the Quarter of Death the next contained Brazil, Mexico, Belgium and Japan and was the Quarter that Would at Least End With a Decent Team in the Semis the third held Spain, Russia, Denmark and Croatia and was the Quarter with Two Good Sides and Two Makeweights. Now it is the turn of the final quarter, the Quarter of Hang on Would You Mind Checking This for Me Something’s Definitely Gone Wrong.Today’s matches start with Sweden v Switzerland, a fixture remarkable mainly for being the first World Cup finals match between alphabetically proximate member states of the United Nations since Germany played Ghana in 2010 (and only the third such encounter of this century, after Poland v Portugal in 2002). Switzerland’s greatest contribution to knockout folklore is probably their last-16 encounter with Ukraine in 2006, which remains definitively the most boring game of football ever played, and in which the Swiss not only refused to score during the actual match but also in the penalty shootout.Oh, the dreaded P word! Harry Kane has been speaking pre-match about his apparently perfect penalty preparations. “Before every game I know where I’m going to go and I try to change it – left, right, down the middle,” he said.

Yet only a handful will be recalled in years to come among the tournament’s defining images. “I also love the overhead picture of Robert Baggio in 1994 because it just shows you how empty it must have felt for Baggio after he missed that penalty. Another angle wouldn’t show it. And the picture of Nigel de Jong taking out Xabi Alonso in 2010 encapsulates that final and that’s ultimately what you want to do. It’s the only picture you need.”Regan is among a select band of photographers who have special ‘access all areas’ passes to Fifa’s showpiece tournament this summer. From player portraits to pre-match tunnel access to prime positions on the touchlines, his memory cards are being filled with distinctive images.“It’s been a great tournament to photograph so far,” he says. “I’ve shot 11 games to date including France v Argentina, Germany getting knocked out and the opening Russia game which was such a massive event. Regan shares their excitement. A boyhood Leicester City fan, he began his career as a photographer in the 1990s after a stint as an assistant. Those were the days of analogue photography, when film had to be ferried from the pitch to a makeshift darkroom midway through the match. “I used to have to knock on people’s doors close to the grounds to ask if we could use their kitchen as a darkroom for 15 or 30 quid,” he explains. “So at Villa Park or wherever you were, you’d run off with the films after 15 minutes, develop them in the kitchen and scan three or four of them over. One time at Middlesborough I spilled the chemicals everywhere – it was a nightmare.”Regan eventually became one of England’s official photographers but with players “suspicious” of the press, candid opportunities were limited. The shot he took of Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney in an ice bath was a rare exception. “When Gareth Southgate came in they realised they don’t have anything to hide and that photography can show people they do care, they do work hard,” he adds.“I really like the picture I took of the squad crowding round watching the under-20s World Cup final last year. Everyone ed into a tiny changing room after training and I managed to get in behind the laptop as they were watching. It struck me as an example of how passionate they are, not just for themselves and their own careers but for the future of the England team.”Passion and personality are two of the qualities Regan and his colleagues also sought to extract from their subjects as they created a striking array of player portraits prior to the World Cup. “They loved it!” Regan says of the vibrant studio pics. “Top players like Ronaldo know photography is fun for their social media and they can put over their personality on it. They really embraced it much, much more than they would have done in past tournaments.”That said, Lionel Messi was less forthcoming. “I said ‘can you hold your hands out?’ and he said ‘no’. So I said ‘what will you do?’ and he said ‘nothing’. But that’s what I expected. That’s everyone’s perception of what Messi’s like – all he cares about is playing football.”Regan instead created a wide-angle portrait of a stressed-looking Messi which seems to capture the Argentinian’s troubled frame of mind in Russia. “He’s got the ball under his arm and all this space around him that he could be larking around in, like the others did, but he isn’t.”With two weeks of the tournament remaining and some of the most critical imagery still to be shot – not to mention countless more air miles to clock – Regan says he’s already running on adrenaline.“Normally when you’re photographing England you’re at home after the first couple of weeks,” he quips. This time, due to Getty’s partnership with Fifa, he’ll be pitchside for the final, hunting as ever for that defining image."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/668c0073ec9ded45400511175bd1ddd275e774d4/0_2_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1aebc50f8849eba05721459adb713bd4","title":"sweden v switzerland world cup 2018 live","story":"35 min: Sweden win a free-kick about 35 yards from the Swiss goal. The ball’s floated towards Granqvist at the far post and he heads it back into the mixer. Switzerland clear.34 min: Xhaka tires one from distance but sends the ball sailing over the bar. 33 min: Granit Xhaka tries to pick out Xherdan Shaqiri with a raking cross-field pass. The ball sails out over the right touchline, of play. 32 min: Sweden’s Mikael Lustig gets booked, a yellow card that means he will miss the next match if Sweden get through to the quarter-finals. It was a silly, needless foul, a pull on Josip Drmic to prevent the Swiss striker getting to the ball.28 min: Decent technique from Berg, who got his leg over (so to speak) a bouncing ball and drove a diagonal shot goalwards. It was heading for the corner, but Sommer did extremely well to fling himself to his right and keep the ball out. 27 min: SAVE! Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer throws himself to his right to claw away a shot from Marcus Berg that was heading for the bottom corner. 26 min: A good defensive header from Mikael Lustig prevents Zuber from getting on the end of another delivery into the Sweden penalty area. Michael Lang was the provider on this occasion.25 min: Zuber sends a cross-field ball towards Shaqiri on the right touchline, but Sweden’s left-back Ludwig Augustinsson intercepts with a meaty header. 24 min: Steven Zuber heads over the bar under pressure after getting on the end of another Shaqiri cross from the right. 21 min: Switzerland counter-attack with Shaqiri on the ball. He curls across towards Blerim Dzemaili near the far post, but overcooks his pass and the ball goes out of play. Shaqiri has looked dangerous and inventive on the right flank for Switzerland, but needs to align his cross hairs. The watchmakers of the country he is representing will be unimpressed with his lack of precision.18 min: Sweden continue to press the Swiss defenders as they attempt to play the ball out from the back. A relatively new innovation brought to the attention of football hipsters by Jurgen Klopp in the past decade, this practice of putting your opponents under pressure was originally invented by the Republic of Ireland under Jack Charlton circa 1986. 17 min: Granit Xhaka attempts to release Ricardo Rodriguez down the left flank, but overhits his pass. Throw-in for Sweden, deep inside their own half.15 min: Xherdan Shaqiri curls a cross from the right in towards the head of Valon Behrami. His delivery is a mite too high and the ball sails out of play. 13 min: For a match that was supposed to be incredibly tight, this has been a very open game thus far, punctuated by defensive errors, lively counter-attacks and hideously poor shooting by both sides. 11 min: Shaqiri plays Dzemaili through on the Sweden goal and from a narrow angle, he makes life very easy indeed for Robin Olsen.10 min: Panic in the Swiss defence, as they make a mess of a goal-kick and gift possession straight back to Sweden, specifically Berg. A crucial block from Manuel Akanji prevents Sweden from capitalising on the defensive gaffe. Albin Ekdal follows up on the rebound, but shoots high over the bar.8 min: Marcus Berg is put through on goal and from a narrow angle, takes a wild slash at the ball and sends it hilariously wide and high into the stand. Moments previously, Switzerland’s Steven Zuber had tried to curl a shot past Robin Olsen after cutting inside from the left, but made life easy for the Swedish goalkeeper. 6 min: Viktor Claesson loses the ball on the edge of his own penalty area, but gets away with it and Sweden gallop upfield on the counter-attack which quickly breaks down.5 min: Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer gets his first touch of the ball after five minutes. 4 min: Switzerland, for the record, are wearing red shirts, white shorts and red socks. Swiss forward Blerim Dzemaili concedes a free-kick in midfield for a shove on Emil Forsberg. 2 min: Granit Xhaka concedes the first foul of the match, knocking Ola Toivonen to the ground. The ball’s floated into towards the far post by Ludwig Augustinsson, where Viktor Claesson attempts to head it across the face of goal. Switzerland clear.1 min: Emil Forsberg gets the ball rolling for Sweden, whose players line up in yellow shirts, blue shorts and yellow socks. They immediately lose the ball and Switzerland go on the attack. Xherdan Shaqiri tries a speculative shot on goal from distance, but larrups the ball wide.The coin toss: It’s first blood to Switzerland, whose skipper Valon Behrami calls correctly.Not long now: The teams emerge from the tunnel and march on to the pitch to the distinctive soundtrack of Seven Nation Army.

Further up the pitch, Steven Zuber is in for Breel Embolo, who travelled home for the birth of his daughter but is now back in Russia. Up front, Josip Drmic, who came off the bench to score against Costa Rica, is rewarded with a starting berth ahead of the disappointing Mario Gavranovic.Swedish team news: Janne Andersson has named his team to face Switzerland and it contains just one change from that which beat Mexico so convincingly.

To be fair, their battle to reach the elusive “fifth game” has usually been an uphill one: they faced Germany in 1998, Argentina in 2006 and 2010, the Netherlands four years ago, and now Brazil. Only against Bulgaria in 1994 and the USA in 2002 were they favourites to advance. Their boss Juan Carlos Osorio is determined to eke out some positives from the latest second-round defeat ... though it’s hard. “The fact that we could play on equal terms against a team like Brazil speaks very well of our attitude, but we lacked efficiency and that extra quality they have in the last third of the field. You have to remember where Gabriel Jesus plays, where Willian and Philippe Coutinho play. Mexican football needs to export more players and they need to compete each weekend with the best, they need to train each week with the best, and then the team will take that jump in quality.”“With dignity I accept a wave of criticism: sometimes malicious, sometimes substantive.” Let us hope Gareth Southgate doesn’t have to resort to similar statements this evening, delightfully worded though it is.

Oh...but what’s this...looks like Riyad Mahrez is off to Manchester City. (There’s only ten games of the World Cup left before football news becomes like this for the next two years.)Don’t take away our breakaways. After Nacer Chadli’s goal last night, Alex Hess has got his time machine on the go. The World Cup sack race continues, after Spain started it before the start of the tournament. Poland coach Adam Nawalka will not have his contract extended after failing to advance from the group phase.Zbigniew Boniek, head of the Polish FA, said Nawalka will stay in the job only until July 30. He has coached Poland since November 2013 and at Euro 2016 had looked to have the beginnings of a decent side. The England team have arrived at their hotel. As they walk in, their phones and headphones are seeing heavy use, aside from Jordan Pickford, who strolled in, bold as brass, not even on his phone or listening to the hit parade or the “In Our Time” podcast, though perhaps he was thinking of not wanting to be the next Joe HartRob GreenPeter Bonetti etc etc. After that shocking revelation from Mikel John Obi, perhaps a good time to read back the interview he did with David Hytner ahead of the tournament. Have a bang on some David Squires.Wayne Rooney thinks England did the right thing by having a go-slow against Belgium and has played the classic “if anything, we’re too honest card”. “For me personally, it’s the right decision,” he told ESPN in Washington DC. “The result, in my opinion - I can say it now, I’m not (an England) player - the result was the best result for England. And maybe that’s been a problem we’ve had the last 15, 20 years as a country: we’re too honest. We sit there and say we want to win every game. This is England. This is how we should play. When all the other countries are plotting their way through, I’m sure Gareth would have liked to have kept the momentum going, but sometimes you need to take a step backward to go forward. I believe it was definitely the right decision.” And with that, I’m going to scuttle off for a break. John Brewin will be your host. Enjoy, enjoy.Many apologies to Alfredo and Lionel, but Diego Maradona is surely the greatest player in Argentina’s history. The greatest manager they’ve had? Not so much. El Diego coached his country at the 2010 World Cup, where they were ked out of sight by Germany, 4-0, in the quarters. Now he’s offering to take over from current coach Jorge Sampaoli, who might have a contract until 2022 but isn’t exactly odds-on to see it through. Maradona was asked by Venezuelan TV whether he’d be interested in doing the job again, and he had no hesitation in replying: “Yes, and I would do it for free. I wouldn’t ask for anything in return. People think I am happy but my heart is heavy. I feel really bad that everything we built with so much effort we destroyed so easily.”Meanwhile the Swiss coach Vladimir Petkovic has cited the cultural ersity within his squad as a major reason for their success so far. Two of Switzerland’s biggest stars, Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka, are ethnic Albanians and of Kosovar heritage, and Petkovic says: “We have managed to bring together different cultures, different talents, different ideologies and they help us to play really good football. We have a team where the chemistry is right, that really goes together, and this is a guarantee for success.” He’s also setting his sights further than the quarters. “What you’ve seen throughout the tournament is that we have been playing really well. We can be a surprise to those who underestimate us. We want to win against Sweden but I don’t think that should be our final objective.” Switzerland will be without the suspended Fabian Schar and Stephan Lichtsteiner Johan Djourou is likely to start in defence. “For our team every missing player is a loss, but at the same time we have a total of 23 in our squad. I can rely on all of them and I’m quite confident that the two who replace them will play just as well.”If Switzerland win this afternoon, they’ll reach the quarters for the first time since 1954. They hosted the event that year, and looked to have one foot in the semis when they went 3-0 up on Austria by the 18-minute mark, only to eventually lose 7-5. The match became known as the Heat Battle of Lausanne, with Austrian goalkeeper Kurt Schmied and Swiss captain Roger Bocquet both treated for sunstroke at half-time. More on that here ...But let’s not get too carried away this evening. Whatever happens, it’s only a game, it’s not worth getting stressed and making yourself ill. With this in mind, a popular pet-food company - other dog treats are available - will be streaming action from a puppy football match this evening, in order to help overly excitedtenseirate England fans manage their blood pressure and heart rate. It’s a great idea. Though why has the tiny black-and-white pup in goal been sent off, 17 seconds into this trailer? That’s a disgraceful decision. VAR to blame, no doubt. It’s ruining the game. Gah! GAH!Tonight’s big game promises to be an event of heightened emotion. In homes across England, anyway. Gareth Southgate wants his players to keep their cool amid the mayhem that is World Cup knockout football, as our award-winning chief football writer Daniel Taylor reports:Our man Ed Aarons has, like Jim Davidson before him, been up the elephant and round the castle. (References to 1980s Thames TV sitcoms, the internet kids can’t get enough of them.) Anyway, the Elephant and Castle is the centre of a thriving Colombian community, and it’ll be the place to watch tonight’s match if you fancy Jose Pekerman’s side to prevail. “I can see it being a really good game,” says one of the chaps Ed meets. “But if England give them time on the ball, then they are in big trouble.”Hot admin news! Our brilliant guide to all the players at this World Cup has been updated with your ratings for yesterday’s games. That’s good news for Willian and Guillermo Ochoa, who were both awarded a shapely 8 for their performances yesterday. An 8 for Neymar too! Sending some love the way of Brazil’s talisman, there, when others are accusing him of all sorts. Pat yourselves on the back, you’re lovely people.South Korea may have put the reigning world champions Germany out, but their performance wasn’t enough to get out of the groups ... and it wasn’t enough to spare the players a humiliating welcome back home. Upon landing in Incheon yesterday, they were pelted by eggs as they lined up for a photo. But the Korean FA have decided not to pursue charges, a local bobby explaining: “Throwing eggs is considered an assault, but it’s also an offence which can’t be prosecuted without the victim’s objection.” Thank goodness they at least registered that win over the Germans, because last time round they finished bottom of their group, and upon returning home from Brazil were pelted with toffees, the most heinous of insults in Korea.But it’s not all bad news for South Korean sport ...The result of today’s match between Sweden and Switzerland is already in. Sort of. Achilles, a deaf cat who normally prowls around the St Petersburg Hermitage museum in the insouciant style, has predicted a Swiss victory. He’s done this by chowing down on a plate of food with the Switzerland national flag stuck in it. But do we trust this Achilles? Is he a chancer? What’s his backstory? Well, he’s already predicted two victories for Russia, Iran’s win against Morocco, and Brazil’s triumph over Costa Rica. The only one he’s got wrong is his choice of Nigeria over Argentina, but the Albiceleste were useless, so you can hardly blame him for calling it the way he did. He’s got form, then. Worried Swedish fans can console themselves with the fact that the banner pictured is not square, and is therefore the civil ensign of Switzerland and not the national flag. Maybe that invalidates the whole process. We can’t take it seriously now.In defence of Neymar. Here with it is John Ashdown (not our one):I had the misfortune of watching xXx: Return of Xander Cage in theatres and thus remember well the bit of acting by Neymar. The scene ends with him and Samuel L. Jackson being blown to bits by an incoming missile, which I suppose will please most of your readers:But I offer this: every team needs a lightning rod like him, a player that attracts all the media flak and controversy (Ronaldo does this very well for Portugal, for instance).By being the centre of attention, Neymar deflects criticism from his teammates and manager. Our conversation about Brazil might have been that they’ve been a bit sluggish that they have a dubious pair of centre-backs that Tité’s tactics are not versatile that his bench is inexplicably shallow (Geromel? Renato Augusto?!?). Instead, it’s all Neymar all the time.Speaking of which, as a Welshman I fully support that this live blog discusses Neymar and the Switzerland-Sweden game and absolutely nothing else today. Thank you.One last, poetic word on brave, broken Japan. And it comes courtesy of Swastik Basu.I absolutely love the subplots peppered throughout the World Cup. In the final group game against Poland, Japan stopped playing as the result in the Colombia-Senegal match was going in their favour and they didn’t want to risk conceding goalsyellow cards which would lead to elimination. Ironically they went through on Fair Play points!The Japan manager was ashamed, he stated publicly that he regretted his own tactics, and promised to make up for it in the round of 16. The shadow of the ethical transgression was clearly looming large as Japan decided to attack Belgium even as they were 2-0 up. Many would call it tactical naivety. I would call it redemption.They took something away from football in that last group game. They gave something back yesterday.Belgium, by contrast, can now look forward to an exciting quarter-final tie with favourites Brazil. Well, sort of. Here’s what their coach Roberto Martinez has been saying. It’s expectation management straight out of the Roy Hodgson playbook.When you play against Brazil, you need to understand they are the best team in the competition. We can enjoy it from the first minute. I don’t think anyone expects us to go through to the semi-finals.Stirring rhetoric. Say what you like about Alf Ramsey, he knew the power of positive thinking. “Gentlemen, most certainly we will win the World Cup.” It’s not a bad way to work.Japan’s veteran coach Akira Nishino insists he should be blamed for their heartbreaking defeat. The 63-year-old didn’t park the bus when his side went two up then he sent his men up for a corner deep into stoppage time, an aggressive decision that had huge consequences.I don’t think the players were to blame, I think it was me who might have lost control of the game. When the goal was conceded, I blamed myself, and I question my tactics. As for the result I am very disappointed. I am devastated. When we were 2-0 up, and I didn’t change my players, I really wanted to score another goal and we did have opportunities.Perhaps when it all comes down, the poor chap will console himself with the knowledge that Japan have made an indelible impression on a World Cup at last. They contributed to an all-time classic in style. Nobody will forget these Samurai Blue in a hurry.Belgium’s spectacular win over Japan was certainly a performance for the ages. It was the first time a team had come from two goals down in a knockout match since Mexico 70, when West Germany avenged 1966 by beating Alf’s England in the quarter-final. That was a story told expertly by Simon Burnton in our World Cup Stunning Moments series. Apologies to anyone old enough to remember the pain of that particular defeat ... but otherwise, enjoy!It’s just as well Gareth rolled the dice, though. Because had England won Group G, we’d never have witnessed last night’s instant World Cup classic between a desperate Belgium team and a Japan side in full banzai mode. Stuart James was at the Rostov Arena to witness history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1506138ae45a64af64b1c71d00a8c742b334fe66/550_875_1422_853/master/1422.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0396b35d873c5e1f6b894a92b54717b3","title":"david squires on the world cup last 16 drama so far","story":"Our resident cartoonist on the big-name exits and gripping round of 16 games at Russia 2018"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4478c16df058f757c0e486d3b9db4c40bc0c714/308_233_3189_1913/master/3189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee150ef6dc40eba70bbc7696e22da34","title":"pregnant teenage girls expectant fathers barred school burundi","story":"Campaigners warn that ban violates human rights and say it is unclear how schools will identify boys for exclusion Campaigners have condemned a ban that will prevent pregnant teenage girls and young expectant fathers from attending formal schooling in Burundi, warning the country is violating its human rights obligations.Burundi’s minister of education, Dr Janvière Ndirahisha, announced last week that pregnant teens and young mums, as well as the boys who made them pregnant, no longer had the right to be allowed into public or private schools. In a letter to the country’s provincial education directors, he added that such students could instead attend vocational or professional training.The move has been called a “double punishment” for girls, and campaigners say it is unclear how schools will identify fathers for exclusion. “More often than not the boy will deny it,” said Naitore Nyamu-Mathenge, a human rights lawyer and programme officer for the organisation Equality Now. “Unless they have a way of proving it – I am sure they will not get into those details – this ban is definitely skewed towards violating the rights of girls accessing education.” Burundi, which has endured years of conflict, has high rates of sexual and gender-based violence. Four in 10 survivors of violence are teenage girls aged 15 to 19.Campaigners warn girls living in poverty are also at risk of having sex in exchange for basics such as clothes, sanitary products, school fees or food.“This is a double punishment for girls,” added Nyamu-Mathenge. “The moment you deny girls a right to education, ultimately other rights will be abused – the right to sexual and reproductive health will be abused.” Last month, Human Rights Watch warned that tens of thousands of girls across Africa are banned or discouraged from education because they are pregnant or married. Many African governments have introduced new laws to protect pregnant teenagers’ access to education, but these policies are not always implemented, the report said. A small number of countries – including Equatorial Guinea, Sierra Leone and Tanzania – have expelled pregnant girls and adolescent mothers. In Tanzania, president John Magufuli was condemned by women’s rights groups last year after he stated, “As long as I am president … no pregnant student will be allowed to return to school.” The country’s secondary schools routinely carry out forced pregnancy testing. Guidelines for a new, alternative education system for young mothers have been developed, but Human Rights Watch said this option is expensive and does not equip students with the same skills or qualifications.Sierra Leone’s ban, which was introduced in 2015 during the Ebola crisis, is now being challenged in a regional court. Equality Now, along with the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa and other partner organisations, is seeking to challenge the ban at the Economic Community of West African States Court of Justice. If successful, this could serve as a precedent for other countries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae23055cdaea0455214780f48329b84c8e0d7a92/0_2900_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47d53597bbfe32328ded6ecb3ae7a3a1","title":"nigel slater baked eggs with summer herbs recipe","story":"Thick wedges of eggy, herby goodness with any amount of sprouted seeds or micro salad leavesSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.

As children, it was the place our parents took us when they needed to shop, where maybe there was the hope of a trip to the toy shop or a drink in a cafe. As adolescents, it was the place we would mooch around on Saturday afternoons, flitting between the handful of shops that might interest us, killing hours over a Coke in McDonald’s. As an adult, my local high street is a place not just to shop but where I know people – the barber, the cafe owner, the fella in the hardware store, the pub landlord, the drunk guy who is always hustling for a quid to buy more lottery tickets. It’s a place of local characters as much as it is two parallel rows of buildings.The high street is woven into the fabric of the lives of everyone living in a town or suburb, which is why the concept of “the high street” has its own place in the news. Just the past few days have brought us stories such as “50,000 jobs lost or threatened on high street this year” “How to mend Britain’s broken high street” “Costa owner blames falling sales on high street decline”, and that’s before we even get to the travails of John Lewis. The high street is a cipher for everyday life. Despite that, and despite British pop’s celebration of the mundane and the parochial, the high street has never been a central location for pop. There is High Street by Blood Orange, which isn’t really about the high street – despite its references to Ilford Lane, a high street in north-east London – until the end, when Skepta raps about the everyday sights: “Single mom struggling with the pushchair  She had a bad mouth but she had good hair  Stole a phone in the shop getting looked at  Barbershop, hairline’s getting pushed back  Guys looking at me like they wanna fight me  Just another day on the high street.” The reference to the barber links it to one of the greatest pieces of English pop parochialism, Penny Lane by the Beatles, where there’s “a barber showing photographs  Of every head he’s had the pleasure to know”. Paul McCartney’s is an idealised high street, where no one is looking at him like they want to fight him.In Shopping, the B-side to the final single by the Jam, Beat Surrender, Paul Weller wasn’t bothered about the high street as any kind of metaphor for a life either contented or disappointed. He was, as the on-the-nose title suggests, out shopping: “As I flit from window to window  I’m trying to pick out a friendly bargain.” It’s an odd little song, and it’s not hard to work out why it was a B-side rather than even an album deep cut. In pop, the high street usually serves as either a token of the everyday, or a locator for songs about the wider metaphorical horror of the suburbs. Ignoring the fact that lots of people live in suburbs because they like them, the idea of the outer districts of cities as wastelands has long preoccupied British songwriters. In Suburbia, Pet Shop Boys are “lost in the high street, where the dogs run … in this suburban hell”.That idea of the suburbs as somewhere to escape from permeates British pop, with the writers willing themselves into lives surrounded by People Like Them, rather than salarymen with narrow horizons, frustrated housewives (the two go hand in hand in much British pop) or the violent thugs of songs such as Everything But the Girl’s Hatfield 1980.Hop across the Atlantic, though, and it’s often a different story. Where Britons have high streets, Americans have main streets, and it’s often a rather less depressing place. “Down on Mainstreet” is where Bob Seger goes to watch “this long, lovely dancer in a little club downtown”, and where Blood, Sweat and Tears see Lucy, who “looks like a Wow!” when she’s “walkin’ down Main Street, lookin’ down”. It’s where people go cruising in Carole King’s Main Street Saturday Night.But US writers saw their main streets ripped apart by the flight to out-of-town malls, similar to how British high streets are now being hit by internet shopping, Brexit and economic uncertainty. In 1984, in My Hometown, Bruce Springsteen noted “Now Main Street’s whitewashed windows and vacant stores  Seems like there ain’t nobody wants to come down here no more.” In Nobody Home, Amy Grant sang of “Main Street USA boarded up and dry  Knowin’ what once was here just makes me want to cry”.Those lyrics speak of an empathy for and love of Main Street that isn’t as present in British songs. When British high streets are boarded up in song, as in the Clash’s Groovy Times, it’s a symptom of how we live in a terrible dystopia. The obvious explanation for the differing tones lies in geography: the US is a nation of small towns, or at least a nation whose art, from Norman Rockwell to Thornton Wilder to Harper Lee to Springsteen, has paid attention to the lives of those small towns and the communities that live in them. When your nearest big city may be hundreds of miles away, it concentrates the mind on looking for positives as well as negatives.To British ears, that can signify a sentimental streak that isn’t there when British writers remember growing up in Huddersfield or Crawley or Oswestry, or wherever. But it makes for a less wearying perspective than the endless procession of British songwriters disparaging the (usually) comfortable lives they led before the city called, and bemoaning the narrow minds of the millions who choose not to live in the city.If you want a British pop song that captures both sides of the high street – the American promenade and our own rather more desolate view of it – try Vicky Verky by Squeeze. Chris Difford’s couple “really trooped the colours  When walking with each other  And all her mates would giggle  As ladylike she’d wiggle  All along the high street  They’d splash out on an ice cream.” Except he’d got the money by robbing people, and ends up in borstal.Vicky Verky doesn’t end on a bleak note, though: back together, the pair go camping and to the coast, where she tells him: “I think I want that chance back  To be perhaps the one  Who will forever love you.” Of course, they couldn’t rekindle their love on the high street: the shops were probably all boarded up by then."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fa8d52279c47395ec0d567e003316552dfd8c5f/140_472_7209_4326/master/7209.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7160661230879cd9138e2407da6abcb7","title":"veronique gens review wigmore hall london takes your breath away","story":"Wigmore Hall, LondonThe soprano and her pianist Susan Manoff brought unforced sincerity and immediacy to a revelatory all-French programmeVéronique Gens is one of today’s great interpreters of French song, an artist deeply committed to the re-evaluation of her chosen repertory in performances of unforced sincerity and immediacy. Her latest Wigmore recital, programmed with her customary intelligence, placed Henri Duparc and Reynaldo Hahn alongside Edmond de Polignac’s rarely heard Lamento, and works by Charles Gounod, Jules Massenet and Jacques Offenbach, composers whose songs are frequently considered inferior to their operatic outputs, an erroneous view, as Gens reminded us.Her singing is characterised by great tonal warmth, a total absence of overt histrionics, and a telling but understated way with words: we’re always conscious of the beauty of the language as well as the music. Gens’s Hahn was knowing and bittersweet as the contained passion of Les Cygnes gave way to the erotic regret of Infidélité. Gounod’s Le Soir oscillated between hope and despair, while Polignac’s Lamento sent shivers down your spine with its eerie allure.

No 10 would not supply details ahead of Friday’s Chequers awayday with some cabinet members complaining they had not seen it.May made an emotional appeal for party unity at a speech at the Conservatives’ summer ball on Monday evening.“Will we find the boldness, the courage and the discipline to unite as one for the good of our nation and fellow citizens?” she said. “Or will we be ided and allow the scale of the challenge, the complexity of the questions to overwhelm us?” The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has told politicians to stop “squabbling” and put Britain’s economic interests first by reaching agreement at Chequers on Friday. It said time was running out before the 29 March 2019 Brexit date and business patience was “reaching breaking point”.The BCC said the government had made “limited progress” on only two of the 23 issues where clarity was urgently needed so firms can plan their trade following the UK’s departure from the EU. The lobby group said while some assurances had been received on the future status of EU nationals, and the industrial standards regime, urgent questions needed to be answered on subjects including VAT, tariffs, customs and regulation.These include whether a business will need to pay VAT on goods at the point of import and what rules of origin firms will have to comply with to receive preferential tariff rates.The BCC said crucial questions also remained on whether goods would be subject to new customs procedures and delayed at border checkpoints after Brexit, and whether businesses would be able to transfer staff between the EU and UK using existing processes . Members also want answers on whether or not UK firms will be able to participate in EU research and development projects after 2020.Over the past fortnight, warnings from firms including Airbus and BMW about the impact of Brexit on jobs and trade were dismissed by cabinet ministers including Jeremy Hunt and Liam Fox, while Boris Johnson reportedly said “fuck business” when asked about industry concerns.The PBSC called for mutual recognition of professional qualifications and regulatory frameworks after Brexit. It also wants assurances that employees in the sector will be able to fly in and out of EU countries to provide advice and trade across Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eeb80a2e0e9c608176488877123a314e3afc415/528_967_4022_2413/master/4022.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da67eef2aeaea43458b7c7874f3c8f2a","title":"labour set to reinstate suspended mp jared omara","story":"Party’s ruling body gives MP formal warning rather than refer him for expulsionLabour will reinstate suspended MP Jared O’Mara after its ruling body was advised to issue him with a formal warning rather than refer him for expulsion, the  understands.O’Mara, who has been suspended since 2017 for abusive comments made on social media, had his case considered by Labour’s national executive committee after waiting more than nine months for a decision, according to sources.A Labour party spokesperson confirmed the MP would be re-admitted to the party. “The disputes panel has ruled on the balance of the evidence that a formal warning should be issued and a mandatory requirement to attend training,” the spokeswoman said.The MP for Sheffield Hallam is among more than 70 cases that will be considered by the NEC’s disputes panel on Tuesday, which examines all complaints deemed serious enough to warrant official sanction.The vast majority are complaints involving antisemitism, including calls for Jews to be murdered, sources said.“Some of the stuff they will have to wade through is awful, some is straightforward Holocaust denial,” one party source said. “We’d expect most of them to be referred for expulsion but there is already a huge backlog of cases.”O’Mara was suspended after homophobic and sexist comments were unearthed on online forums, including inviting members of Girls Aloud to an orgy and saying the musician Jamie Cullum should be “sodomised with his own piano”. He was also accused of shouting abuse at a woman he met on a dating app.Party officials who have examined the case against the MP, who defeated former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg in Sheffield Hallam in 2017, advised that NEC members issue him with an official warning, which was accepted. Sources said the panel had ruled that the case did not meet the threshold for a hearingby the party’s independent disciplinary committee, the national constitutional committee.The NCC is the only body with the power to expel members from the party and has ruled on recent high-profile cases including Marc Wadsworth and the former mayor of London Ken Livingstone.O’Mara would not have been compelled to resign his seat if he had been expelled from the party, and could have chosen to sit as an independent MP for the rest of this parliament. Party sources said the panel had no capacity to rule on whether O’Mara had behaved with the conduct expected of an MP, and could only decide whether he had broken the rules expected of any other party member.The panel were asked to take into account the apology O’Mara gave for the comments he made online to fellow MPs before his suspension, some of which were made fifteen years ago, saying he had been “on an education journey.”Labour was known to be wary of forcing any potential by-election in Sheffield Hallam, where the Lib Dems and the Conservatives would be likely to heavily target the seat. O’Mara has never spoken in parliament, but has voted with the Labour whip on several crunch votes. At the meeting on Tuesday, committee members elected Claudia Webbe as the chair of the disputes committee, which oversees disciplinary cases. Former chair Christine Shawcroft was forced to quit the committee after it emerged she had opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial.Webbe, a former adviser to Livingstone in City Hall, is an influential ally of Corbyn and gains a place on the powerful NEC officers’ group. In leaked minutes of the last disputes meeting in March, it was revealed that key supporters of Corbyn attempted to block action against Labour members facing complaints.Momentum’s founder, Jon Lansman, the MP Jon Trickett and Darren Williams, one of the constituency party representatives, regularly lobbied other members to limit disciplinary action in several contentious cases, sources told the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6e6ea78db0fc108d458dedcb6d53ff319bb1149/596_76_1622_973/master/1622.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a0c88a961910209cffc5573e33f5828","title":"brexit business says government indecision leading to significant slowdown in investment politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenCrawford says the UK will not be able to legally start new trade negotiations until it has left the EU after 29 March 2019.Q: You said, if there was no deal, we would still be able to carry over these 40 trade deals by March 2019 for the transition. But if there was no deal, there would be no transition.Hollingbery says the government would still want these deals agreed by March.Q: But they could not be carry over deals, because there would be nothing to carry over to.Hollinbery says he does not want to mislead Green. He reminds her that he is new in his job. (He only took evidence last week.) He says he will write to the committee.Q: What is the government’s position on whether future trade deals should include investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) arrangements?Hollingbery says he thinks the government does not have a fixed few. In some trade deals they might not be appropriate. But in others they will be.Q: What will happen if there is no transition and no agreement?Hollingbery says work will have to be completed much sooner.Q: Will the UK just fall out of these 40 trade deals?No, says Hollingbery. He says the plan would be to carry these over by March.Q: Is there any precedent for a country carrying over free trade deals, in the way the UK is planning to carry over the EU ones?Hollingbery says a lot of work has gone on already in terms of speaking to these countries.As for whether there is precedent, he says he does not know. But he says he has been advised that carrying over these deals is “tenable”. He says the government has a “reasonable degree of confidence” that it will be able to carry over these deals.Crawford says some countries, like South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, have said they are happy to carry over these deals.But he says in trade terms he does not think there has ever been an example quite like this, he says.Q: How many of the 40 or so countries have said they are happy about carrying over these deals?Crawford says he does not know how many have said they are happy about this in public. There are more who have said they are happy in private, but he says you cannot always bank on those.Q: And have any countries objected?Crawford says “there are a few that have asked questions”. But he says that is not the same as objecting.Q: And have any countries tried to use the process to get better terms?Crawford says some have asked for something extra. But the UK has said at this point it just wants to carry over these deals. He says, even if both sides wanted to renegotiate, it would not be possible to do it by March 2019 anyway.Richard Drax, the Conservative Brexiter, goes next.Q: Are you deeply frustrated about doing this job for a year but not having clarity about what Brexit policy will be? You have spent a year achieving probably not very much.Crawford says he is glad to have had a year. He needed to build capacity. He says he is already working on 40 agreements that need to be carried over. This process has not received much attention. He is not complaining about that, he says. Trade negotiators are generally a shy lot, he says. He would prefer to live under a rock.He says the government has said it will leave the customs union. As a bottom line, that is all he needs to know.That means he will be in a position to negotiate with third countries.Matters of detail are not resolved. But his department is not the responsible department, he says.Cash says at least one member of the committee has left the hearing because Falconer and Hollingbery are refusing to discuss the Brexit negotiation.Q: Will the UK be in a stronger position negotiating trade deals with other countries if it maintains regulatory alignment with the EU?Crawford says that is another version of the question asked earlier. He says he cannot really answer because it is Brexit policy. But there are some forms of regulation that are a constrain to trade deals.The question is, what the nature of that regulation is, and where it bites.He says part of the reason for his reticence is that there is a negotiation on. He does not want to say anything that might constrain that.Q: President Trump has reservations about the currency advantages Germany has against the US by being in the euro. How would this affect the UK?Crawford says he thinks the UK will be able to develop trade policy in a way that is most advantageous. Falconer says the UK wants to transition across the EU free trade agreements that the UK benefits from, so that after Brexit they continue to apply to the UK as a third country.Back at the European scrutiny committee, Crawford Falconer, the government’s chief trade negotiation adviser, says there is case for saying the UK can do more in terms of promoting exports even while it is in the EU.Labour will reinstate suspended MP Jared O’Mara after its ruling body was advised to issue him with a formal warning rather than refer him for expulsion, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports.Q: Are there are enough trade negotiators?Falconer says the facetious answer would be to say, since they are not negotiating anything now, they have more than they need.But, for the future, he says he thinks there will be enough.It will depend on how many negotiations are going on at the same time, he says. “We may well need to train more,” he says.He says you do not need to have been doing trade negotiations for 20 years to be good at this. If you have done policy and you are smart, you can learn, he says. He says the UK produces many people like this.Falconer says by 2050 eight out of 10 of the world’s biggest economies will be outside the EU. So there are huge opportunities for the UK outside the EU, he says.Marcus Fysh asks why Greg Clark, the business secretary, is dissenting from government policy (in backing continuing single market membership). Hollingbery says that is not something he can comment on.This is from the Independent’s Rob Merrick.Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter and committee chair, goes next. He asks Falconer if he is going to the Chequers meeting on Friday.Crawford says he has not been invited.But he says that does not mean he thinks he should have been there, or that he is “bitter and twisted” about that. It would have been extraordinary if he had been invited. He is not at the centre of the negotiation process.It is essentially a political meeting, he says.Richard Drax, a Tory Brexiter, says Falconer should be there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f806e0e54f00ee40864c83cb1c179bd77bd0f78/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=254b85b6873b3d3923a6bef23ed348da","title":"jeane freeman not scotlands job mitigate worst excesses westminster","story":"Welfare must be based on dignity, fairness and respect, says former Scottish minister for social securityJeane Freeman was until last week the Scottish government’s minister for social security, responsible for delivering Scotland’s first devolved welfare system. As she succinctly put it, in\u0026nbspan\u0026nbspinterview that took place just prior to her promotion to health secretary: “My job is the creation of\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsppublic service that currently does not exist, and I’ve got to do that in three years.”A landmark bill that builds the legislative framework for the new welfare system received royal assent in April after months of intense scrutiny, moulded by genuine cross-party engagement and third-sector expertise, alongside the experience of thousands of ordinary Scots canvassed in a\u0026nbspcountrywide consultation. The new act radically differs from the UK government’s approach: for example, it recognises social security as a human right offers automatic split payments of universal credit to protect women’s financial autonomy and guarantees that the private sector will not carry out disability assessments.But Freeman is mindful that the next challenge – now facing her successor Shirley-Anne Somerville – is to ensure that legislative pledges to base the new welfare system on dignity, fairness and respect run through it in practice like a stick of rock. “The principles were really important to have on the face of the bill,” she says, “but if that’s where they stay then they’re just warm words. They need to be made real for people.”A charter will be co-written with people who have personal experience of the benefits system stating how they can expect to be treated and what they can do if that does not happen. It will be approved by parliament “to give it a status that distinguishes it from just another bit of paper that an agency sticks on its wall”, says Freeman.Perhaps the most visible change will be the absence of security guards in the new agency’s offices: other humanising aspects will include the availability of private spaces, comfortable seating and ease of access to disabled toilets.“I firmly believe it is not the Scottish parliament’s job to mitigate the worst excesses of Westminster,” Freeman insists. A recent report for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found high destitution rates in some Scottish cities, largely due to the UK welfare system’s botched rollout of universal credit. “We spend about £120m in ensuring no one has to suffer the effects of the bedroom tax. The Scottish welfare fund now has an element to cope with the welfare cap, so we do a fair amount to mitigate. But there has to be a\u0026nbsppoint at which we are saying it is not our job to run around Scotland sticking plasters on chasms of difficulty that the UK government is causing.”More immediately, Freeman points to the difficulties caused by the Department for Work and Pensions’ failure to meet deadlines to transfer crucial information about benefits and claimants. Her frustration boiled over at the SNP’s June conference when she told delegates that the DWP “couldn’t run a bath”, arguing that “we’re setting the pace and they aren’t matching it”, and that Scotland “comes bottom of their to-do list”.Freeman was a senior political adviser to former Scottish Labour first minister Jack McConnell. She stood successfully as an SNP candidate for Carrick, Cumnock and\u0026nbspDoon Valley just two years ago, after becoming a prominent advocate for women’s voices in the 2014 campaign for independence.Last week, in a sweeping cabinet reshuffle, Nicola Sturgeon asked Freeman to be her health secretary – a portfolio the first minister herself held for five years under Alex Salmond – after Shona Robison resigned following mounting pressure from opposition parties over the performance of NHS Scotland. It\u0026nbspis one of the most difficult briefs in Holyrood as the service faces significant funding and recruitment problems.Of the challenge, Freeman says: “I have a personal and family background in the health service, and I have nothing but admiration for every person who works in our NHS whatever their job is. There have always been challenges and demands on the NHS and that will continue. I will continue and build on the commitment and excellent work of Shona Robison, my predecessor. One of the successes of our health service is that people are living longer, and that puts different demands on it. So it is critical that we are, together, able to adapt and change to meet those demands.”Education: Ayr Academy ​Glasgow College of Technology (MA politics and sociology).Career: 2018-present: cabinet secretary, health and sport, Scottish government 2016-18: minister for social security, Scottish government 2016-present, MSP Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley 2005-16: founder and chief executive, Freeman Associates 2001-05: senior political adviser to first minister Jack McConnell, Scottish government 1999-2001: senior civil servant, Scottish education department 1987-99: founder and chief executive, Apex Scotland 1985-87: consultant, Saatchi and Saatchi Charity Unit 1985-86: researcher and script writer, BBC, and bookkeeper, LSE Student Travel 1981-85: general secretary, British Youth Council 1981-82: parliamentary researcher, Westminster 1979–81: chair, the National Union of Students Scotland.Public life: Former member: Parole Board for Scotland Scottish Police Authority Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland and chair of the Golden Jubilee Foundation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4439a0d6b9debe539282adb8ad8c60459443333/360_66_3348_2009/master/3348.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e865065acbd33e6f920a443802fab00a","title":"post oxfam charities must come clean on how donors money is spent","story":"Funders want charities to show that every penny they raise goes to the frontline. But what about the vital role of backroom staff?If a week is a long time in politics, four months seems to be an aeon, as least as far as charity donations from inidual givers are concerned.At the start of year, when scandals broke about Oxfam and the Presidents Club, dire consequences were predicted. Thousands of donors were, it was reported, cancelling direct debits as a result of their disillusion with charities. Charity leaders felt they had been dealt another body blow, just as they were starting to recover from the collapse of Kids Company and questionable fundraising practices.This is not to minimise the consequences for Oxfam, which has been forced to make cuts of £16m to its aid programmes and lay off staff, after losing government funding. And Sports Relief saw a big fall in the amount it raised on the night of its televised appeal in March, from £55m in 2016 to just £38m this year – the lowest for a decade. But many in the sector are breathing a sigh of relief that the general impact seems to have been less cataclysmic than predicted.Part of the problem is that funders continue to believe they maximise their impact by giving every penny to the frontline, and they want charities to be able to demonstrate that almost every last penny they raise goes directly to the projects and people they support. This is in line with the narrative peddled by all UK governments since 2010 that public services are “bloated” with administrative staff. In the public sector, this has resulted in vital support staff being valued much less than those on the frontline. For charities, this focus could be lethal, as a new report by the thinktank, Charity Futures, makes clear. In the report, Stephen Bubb, the former chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, points out that charities need to spend money on administration and monitoring in vital areas like safeguarding. He singles out Comic Relief, but there are plenty of other examples where charities shy away from any idea that they have admin costs: Crisis, asking for £26.08 last Christmas to cover the “exact cost” of funding a place at one of its Christmas centres, Combat Stress’s pitch for £21 to pay for an hour of its helplinefor veterans suffering mental health problems, or the RSPCA’s winter appeal request for £8 to feed a cat over three days of the holidays, £10.40 for a rabbit, or £12 for a dog.Bubb and Daniel Fluskey, head of policy and research at the IoF, believe the way forward is to change the language used around fundraising. The Charity Futures report says charities should attach a “warm glow” to core costs by identifying the backroom staff who are integral to a charity’s function.Warm glow or not, more has to be done on the narrative about how charities operate and spend donors’ money.Jane Dudman is the ’s public leaders editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2447541f23cc57d8f695b7716ee5664528ca3b63/830_162_2605_1563/master/2605.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0804009b0108a9a25283540fad9fd136","title":"chris froome team sky leader tour de france","story":"• Dr Oliver Rabin plays down fears over salbutamol tests• Froome named in Team Sky squad for Tour de FranceThe Wada head of science has sought to play down fears that Chris Froome’s salbutamol case may raise questions about other tests dependent upon threshold levels of banned substances. Dr Oliver Rabin said that he was not concerned about further fall-out from the verdict, in which Froome was cleared of any potential wrongdoing after showing a high level of salbutamol in an anti-doping test at last year’s Tour of Spain.Wada had been “well aware of salbutamol’s variability,” Dr Rabin said. “That is why an adverse finding only opens the door to further study – it’s not an automatic sanction.”Dr Rabin was keen to underline that the Froome case was specific but not completely unique. “In this case, we had several specific elements,” he said.“Given all of this we decided an excretion study was impossible and the finding was not inconsistent with therapeutic dosages. It’s not a unique case but because it was Froome, a sporting celebrity, and it was put in the limelight, it appears to be unique. For now, we have no reason to question the rules. We can see no reason that previous cases have not been handled fairly.”News of the Froome verdict was coolly received in the French media, with both l’Equipe and Le Monde – which revealed the story with the  in December – unwilling to let the four-times Tour winner completely off the hook.With full details of the decision yet to be released, l’Equipe’s verdict was that, “for the moment, the explanations that have been provided do not allow all doubt to be removed”. Le Monde, for its part, speculated that Wada might have feared a costly legal battle against Team Sky and Froome.As expected Froome was named on Tuesday in Team Sky’s eight-man line-up for the Tour, with the big surprise the selection of the young Colombian climber Egon Bernal alongside old hands Luke Rowe and Geraint Thomas.Speaking to The Times, the four-times Tour winner refused to be drawn into a war of words with the five-times winner Bernard Hinault, who had called for the peloton to strike if Froome were allowed to start the race without the case being resolved.“I can’t say anything bad about Bernard,” said the Team Sky leader. “He’s one of the great champions. I imagine with age sometimes your wires get a little bit crossed, but if I see him I’ll very happily explain it all in a bit more detail.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5324fc63825dc16a9f02d01bc1f676d175a01638/0_127_2843_1706/master/2843.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42d98007fb1151a2e8b1088b1fee9a0c","title":"donnacha obrien classics racing","story":"While he has proved superbly effective in big races this season, nothing better shows the maturity of Donnacha O’Brien and the quality of his upbringing than his response to a somewhat unexpected line of criticism directed at him this weekend. “I think he might be the wild one of the family, from what I hear” a British-based trainer said on Sunday, live on Racing UK. “I wish he’d stop snapchatting my 16-year-old daughter.”Perhaps the 19-year-old jockey gets this kind of thing from a lot of fathers. He was, after all, described as “darkly handsome” by one recent interviewer. But he puts a bit of thought into formulating his answer as we talk in The Curragh’s weighing room, taking care to avoid caddishly causing embarrassment to anyone else and eventually settling for: “He made me sound worse than I was.”It’s a mildly amusing ersion for a young man who, like the rest of his family, is all about horses. Raised at Ballydoyle, the dominant stable in Irish Flat racing, and a son of Aidan O’Brien, he was always likely to get some enviable chances in big races when he took out his jockey’s licence but surely no one expected the sudden success he has enjoyed in the past two months.The highest point yet came when he won Saturday’s Irish Derby on the 14-1 shot Latrobe. The winning trainer was his brother, Joseph, who credited Donnacha with a race-winning move in the early stages, the jockey having quickly realised the pace was slow and eased forward into a much handier position than had been planned.It is hardly common to see a jockey so obviously making the difference when it matters most and many a rider would rather stick to the original script. But Donnacha’s situation gives him some freedom. “Joseph kinda leaves it up to me,” he says.“When I’m riding for Joseph and Dad, I know that if I do mess up, I’m not going to get a bollocking, I’m not going to lose any rides. When it’s like that, it makes it a lot easier.“There’s no one in the world understands racing better than Joseph and he knows that the more you’re tied down to instructions, the less adaptable you are in a race. So he leaves it up to me a lot. We have a talk beforehand, what might happen and things like that. But once the gates open, I know that I can change whatever I want and I’m not going to get in trouble.”Following the famously modest example set by his father, Donnacha wants us to accept that his recent victories are to some extent the result of chance. He was “lucky” to be drawn wide on Latrobe and therefore able to move forward at will. It was “pure luck” that he was on the right horses in both the 2,000 Guineas and the Oaks, when the stable had other fancied runners some suggest, however, that he has become a fair judge of equine talent and that his familiarity with the Ballydoyle horses will continue to be a help to him.He is as phlegmatic about his weight. Being tall, he is likely to get heavier and be forced out of the weighing room, as Joseph was. “I could have only this year left, I could have five years left. My weight’s good at the minute but I don’t know when it’s gonna change.“We’ll see. I’m very lucky to be in the position I’m in at the minute and I’m very happy, but I don’t know what’s going to happen in an hour, never mind in five years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/660587e966b4f10d421524e1912d758028ba6d74/0_44_2137_1282/master/2137.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb1983d8884a1f5c85ba8cf6ce03feaa","title":"englands dry spell puts the heat on crickets groundskeepers","story":"India start their English campaign with a T20 match in Manchester early on Tuesday evening, but it isn’t the Manchester that they are used toIndia probably thought they were flying to the UK for a back-to-back five-Test tour to be played largely on green seamers. India were probably right. However, the summer of 2018 has so far thrown a curveball.India start their English campaign with a T20 match in Manchester early on Tuesday evening, but it isn’t the Manchester that they are used to. There has been no substantial rain here for weeks, tomatoes limp on in garden dust bowls, water butts are empty and a smell of burning drifts across the city from the fires on the hills at Saddleworth and Bolton, releasing, possibly, pollution stored in the peatlands since the industrial revolution.In the recreational game, players are having to pinch themselves. Seasons usually punctuated by rain abandonments are racing ahead. Once lush outfields are tinder dry, yellowing and sharp under foot. Pitches are cracking under the strain. And that’s before the hosepipe ban that is surely on the way unless the weather breaks.Spare a thought then for the professional groundsman or woman, presented with a summer heatwave after a long, damp, cold winter and early spring.Down at Chelmsford, Stuart Kerrison is enjoying a rare day off on Tuesday, watching the tennis at Wimbledon. Kerrison was appointed head groundsman at Essex in 1991 at only 23, and he is respected for his vast experience, genial nature and a penchant for featuring little lego figures on his Twitter account.He’s been on the books at Essex for even longer, arriving on a youth training scheme in 1984, but this is one of the driest spells that he can remember.“We’ve only had half a millimetre of rain in the last five weeks, whereas we’ve had 100ml of water evaporate out of the ground,” he says. “I’ve had a look back through my records and this is the least amount of rain we’ve ever had in a month.”The conditions have meant long hours, and lots of early mornings and late nights when the temperatures are lower and the conditions are better for watering.“We haven’t got the fancy irrigation of the Test grounds and the biggest problem is that we can’t get enough water in the wicket. It really has been ridiculously hot. I might put a sprinkler on for seven hours overnight, but within two hours it is dry again. The pitches are tending to get slower and starting to crack.”“A couple of our lads went to Cape Town last year to play club cricket, but they ended up having a two-month holiday because the cricket was cancelled because of the severe drought. I don’t think it would come to that here as we get dispensation from the water companies, but we’ve got to be aware that we don’t waste water. We water the pitch and the practise area but we don’t water our outfield.” Should the heatwave continue, and the rain, if it comes, proves to be the wrong type of rain – sudden torrential downpours rather than nice steady precipitation - Kerrison can envisage having to cut back his watering further. Back in the north-west, Andy Carmichael is watching the summer unfold with interest. He worked at Cranfield University in 2012 as a research assistant, a post part-funded by the ECB, looking at the sustainability of cricket. He came up with a number of recommendations for clubs in times of drought. His research has led him to a scepticism of the psychological and behavioural approaches to the challenges sport faces in a time of climate change. He is now in favour of a more sociological approach, even if it means questioning fundamental beliefs.“We’ve done the science to death,” he says, “the science says the situation is serious but sport just doesn’t take it seriously.” He advocates thinking the unthinkable “Why have we decided to play cricket on a big lump of clay soil at times of weather extremes? We should be considering drop-in pitches, plastic pitches, cricket hubs rather than scattered clubs.”People may pall at this vision of the future, but this scorching summer the pitches are still very much a product of our capricious climate, which means that England will be playing India on a series of dry turners. Almost inevitably, the English spinning conveyor-belt has hit a technical hitch.Hampshire leg-spinner Mason Crane is out for the rest of the season with a stress fracture of the back. Jack Leach’s season has been interrupted, first of all by breaking his thumb in the nets during a warm-up involving a dog-thrower at Taunton, then by concussion after being hit on the head by Morne Morkel. Moeen Ali seems to have been discarded by the red-ball selectors, which leaves Dom Bess in possession, veteran of two Tests.This combination of heatwave, injury-prone spinners and opponents who are the best players of spin in the world, makes the upcoming Test series a potentially tinderbox one for England. But there is an upside, for Kerrison at least. “To be honest I rather like it,” he says. “If the outfield dies back it is not the end of the world, it’ll grow back. And the tan’s coming along really well.”This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

The 20-year-old also told me he believed he had grown up. “I am getting older,” he said. “I don’t need people shouting at me to tell me what I did wrong.” With his win at the Red Bull Ring, certainly showed remarkably maturity.Where Lewis Hamilton and Daniel Ricciardo suffered from tyre blistering, Verstappen had his rubber under control. The worst damage was caused by the loading through the last two right-handers and the team principal, Christian Horner, believed Verstappen dealt with it superbly. “That is where Max was really cute,” he said. “He backed off through those right handers and made his time in the other parts of the circuit. A really, really mature drive.”The Dutchman was able to keep his rear left cooler than the rear right, a remarkable achievement, Horner described as “unbelievable” and further evidence that Max was right to believe in Max.It was a different story for Hamilton who suffered from heavy blistering, and was forced to stop again before he retired. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, said it had been unexpected but it was noticeable that Ferrari did not have an issue. “Everyone who suffered from the blistering was attacking,” said Wolff. “We were going flat out, and going flat out means you are overheating the surface of the tyre, and that causes the blistering.”Hamilton certainly believed it stymied his charge. “Managing tyres wasn’t difficult it was just that I was trying to overtake,” he said. “That’s the problem you can’t attack with these tyres. That has robbed the fans of seeing any motor racing.”Ferrari may beg to differ and that its car is easier on the rubber is clear. At McLaren however it has just prompted more head scratching. “A lot of people started to have problems with rear tyre blisters,” said Fernando Alonso. “We didn’t and that’s what allowed us to move up the order in the last few laps. We have to understand why we didn’t suffer from blistering, if we did something different compared to the other teams, because that was the key for coming through the field.”Down on power to their rivals at the front of the grid, Austria proved once again that Red Bull are increasingly adept at taking advantage of every possible situation to turn the tables. In China their lightning fast decision to pit under the safety car proved to be a race-wining call for Daniel Ricciardo and once again in Austria their bold decision to pit both cars under the virtual safety car gave them an advantage that was unassailable by Ferrari or Mercedes, even had the latter’s cars not expired.Horner paid tribute to his crew. “You have to have confidence in your boys to nail a double stop with the proximity that the drivers were in there,” he said. “We have got the best guys in the pitlane without any shadow of a doubt. It was a ballsy call but it was the right thing to do and it paid idends.” Wolff admitted his team had got stuck in a “thinking loop” assessing options which proved to be a mistake. Red Bull are suffering from no such distractions and are formidably sharp.Racing in their 50th grand prix in Austria, the Haas team left with every reason to celebrate. Fourth and fifth for Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen was the team’s best finish and enough to pass Force India and McLaren and take fifth place in the constructors’ championship.The team enjoy a technical partnership with Ferrari and use the impressive Ferrari power unit but while the attrition at the front of the field played a part, the team’s pace was ominously strong throughout the weekend. In qualifying Grosjean was sixth, beating Ricciardo and just five-hundredths slower than Verstappen. More importantly the gap to best of the rest behind them – Renault – was a massive eight-tenths. Members of the other midfield teams said they were shocked at the Haas pace with Renault’s Carlos Sainz saying the gap was “a world” away.Haas backed it up in the race and appear to be creating a midfield group of one, to team principal Günther Steiner’s delight. “Everybody realised the potential the car has got, but we just didn’t turn it into enough points. This time, we scored.” he said.Having drawn harsh criticism in the past by employing team orders in Austria, perhaps the Scuderia decided that discretion was the better part of valour this time in not making Kimi Raikkonen move over for Sebastian Vettel.In 2001 Ferrari ordered Rubens Barrichello to cede second place to Michael Schumacher on the last lap, which was not well-received but there was uproar a year later when they once again ordered the Brazilian, who had led every lap from pole, to give the win to Schumacher. Interestingly Ferrari had much less reason to do so that year, with a dominant Schumacher ultimately going on to win the title with six races remaining.This season it appears every point will count and Vettel could have had three more. The team have favoured him in the past over Raikkonen but it may be that switching the Finn who was absolutely charging at the end was deemed too likely to provoke another storm in the mountains of Spielberg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a752611531deae314676a2dd8c2a20a99c3e2d25/0_228_3863_2318/master/3863.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c4202c25eea2ac51f6a0ba9183a30f5","title":"shoestring sailor alec rose round the world sailing","story":"There were two reasons why Alec Rose wanted to sail around the world. One was to visit his son who lived in Melbourne, the other was the simple matter of having done it. Rose was 59 at the time, and working as a greengrocer in Portsmouth. He left on 16 July 16 1967, and got back 354 days later on 4 July 1968. They say there were more than a quarter-of-a-million people waiting for him on the day he landed. The voyage made him one of the most famous men in the country and earned him a knighthood. Sir Alec was absolutely baffled by it. “What,” he asked, “have I done to deserve this?” He went back to work at as greengrocer.Rose’s fame burned its traces on his home town. There’s a lane named after him near the Guildhall, sheltered housing in Gosport, and a Wetherspoon’s pub in Port Solent, and a blue plaque up near the Victory memorial in Southsea. There were plans to mark the 50th anniversary of his homecoming with a get-together in Castle Field, too. The organisers wanted to gather enough people to make “the world’s largest human image of a ship”. They thought it would take 371 but then Guinness told them that a school in the UAE had just broken that very same record and they now needed 4,883. So they abandoned the plan.Maybe it’s for the best. Rose wasn’t the first man to sail around the world, or the fastest, he was just the one who did it with the least amount of fuss. There can’t have been a sportsman who had less interest in his own fame or the bullshit business of bolstering it. Rose had no reason to go other than his want to do so. “I just felt it was my personal affair and really interested no one else,” Rose said. He refused take on any sponsors, to “share his values” with a few choice brands. No one knew whose shirts he wore or which scents he preferred. Because, he said: “I wanted to be captain of my ship and beholden to no one.”Rose paid for the boat, a 36-foot ketch called Lively Lady, out of his own savings. It took him 15 years to scrape the money together. He was a very ordinary sort of hero, a man who embodied qualities a lot of English people like to think we share, and which a lot of English people suspect we’ve lost. “He had immense courage, perseverance, and endurance, but above all modesty,” his friend Sir David Mackworth wrote when Rose died in 1991. “This modesty came out in many ways and I am sure it is the chief reason why Portsmouth, and then the whole country, took him to their hearts.”He was a year behind Francis Chichester, who had just been knighted for becoming the first man to sail single-handed along the old Clipper route, around the Cape of Good Hope through the Roaring Forties to Cape Horn.Rose planned, for a time, to race against him, though he knew he would never win. Chichester’s boat, the Gipsy Moth IV, was purpose built for the trip. The Lively Lady was built in an Indian laundry shed, made out of teak and Andaman padauk. When Rose first set off to race Chichester he got caught in a storm, collided with a freighter, and sailed home again. The press called him “the shoestring sailor”.“I felt such a fraud having a wonderful send-off for the second time in a year,” Rose said when he left again. His friends made an effort with his farewell, because they thought it would be the last they ever gave him. “They would come along and ask if it were true and express real concern.”Rose remembered: “Quite a few believed they would never see me again. They all thought I was completely mad.” But his biggest worry, he explained, was that he wanted everyone to understand that “it was a personal adventure I have saved for all my life, and when I come back I don’t want the ballyhoo that Sir Francis got. That was just terrible.”Rose didn’t even want to take a radio with him, but was persuaded to so he could keep in touch with his wife, Dorothy, who ran the grocer’s shop while he was away. “No one was more surprised,” Mackworth wrote, “when halfway round his modest adventure suddenly became big news.” It wasn’t an easy story to cover, for most of his trip no one had any idea where the hell he was. For weeks at a time there was no news at all. “Watch for Alec Rose” reported the  on 15 March, and “Still No Signal from Alec Rose” on 16 March, then “No Anxiety Yet over Alec Rose” on the 17th. The Daily Mirror and ITN even started chartering search planes to try and find him.Miles below, Rose was busy minding his own business. “I was happy and content, I had all I needed. I had a good boat under me and felt as free as the birds that circled above, I was king of my little world.” When Rose finally re-emerged, 50 miles off the Scilly Isles, Dorothy told him how excited everyone was. “He seemed a bit dubious about the size of the reception that was planned,” she said, “and I told him that if he would do these silly things he must expect it.” Rose never made another voyage, but spent the rest of his life pootling about the south coast and raising money for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960da762fde0fa5de073916c867269f993e57392/0_124_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96b94838f36858fdcf98f03c9d32a507","title":"rugby league learn world cup russia","story":"Players do not need to be born in the country they represent but they do need to build those international bonds over timeBy Gavin Willacy for No Helmets RequiredThe World Cup has shown rugby league fans there are a few things we need to stop worrying about. Yes, some players in our sport seem to have few obvious connections to their international teams, but a few of the footballers at the World Cup are not so different.As with the Rugby League World Cup, there are teams with hardly any players based in their home country. Australia and Denmark have only three players at domestic clubs Nigeria just have one – the reserve keeper. Like Australia at the Rugby League World Cup in 2017, England are the only country for whom all 23 members of the squad are based in their home league. Again, it does not seem to be the problem some make it in rugby league.However, the World Cup has also highlighted some of the weaknesses in rugby league’s version. There were games in Russia every day for the first fortnight. Last year’s Rugby League World Cup was restricted to weekends only, which meant the tournament lost momentum midweek. Steps are being taken to change this. At the next Rugby League World Cup, in England in 2021, games are to be spread through the week, utilising the Thursday to Monday fixture schedules to which UK sports fans are accustomed.Fifty-seven players went to Russia with three or fewer caps. Twenty-five of them were goalkeepers (including England’s Nick Pope, whose international career still amounts to the 25 minutes of a pre-tournament friendly). The only uncapped outfield player was Egypt defender Mahmoud Hamdy. Only two squads – Australia and Serbia – contained more than three players with fewer than four caps. In other words, almost every player had been involved long before the tournament and were not recruited specifically for the World Cup – something that has troubled rugby league.The Rugby League World Cup always sees a clutch of NRL and Super League stars appearing from nowhere to get a piece of the action. Others reappear having not played for their country since the previous World Cup. Italy’s three superstars at the 2017 tournament – James Tedesco, Mark Minichiello and Paul Vaughan – had not played for the Azzurri since the 2013 edition. Eddy Pettybourne didn’t play in a single international for USA between World Cups, Bureta Faraimo in just one.There is an obvious need to continue to increase the number of international fixtures in our sport, but also for professional players to be engaged with their mother nation more than just every four years. They will not regret it. “I treasure playing for England more as I grow older,” Warrington prop Chris Hill told me recently. “When you’re a kid, just bouncing around, you think it’s going to last forever. I’m not going to be doing it for the rest of my life so I’ll enjoy it while I can.”Missing summer breaks for end-of-season tournaments seems less of an issue in football than it does in league. But with international RL players never getting the off-season that their club-mates enjoy in October and November, for one year in each World Cup cycle we should stage more internationals mid-season, rather than at the end. Or perhaps tournaments such as the European Championship and Pacific Cup should start in June and conclude in October to reduce the post-season commitment.“It is tough backing up every year, not getting much off time,” says Hill, who played in England’s win over New Zealand in Denver. “You end up going season upon season upon season upon season – and that takes its toll. It’s not so much on your body, but on your family and friends. You’re missing out on your kids, you might not get a break away as a family. There is a definite life but I’ll never retire from international rugby league. I wouldn’t give up playing for my country.”If all professional leagues took a break for a couple of weeks during the NRL’s State of Origin series, we could have international fixtures all over the world. Ironically, a gaggle of stars would have been unavailable for their Tier 2 countries in the recent “Rep Weekend” anyway as they were playing in Origin, although Anthony Milford managed to do both (Origin 1 for Queensland, then for Samoa against Tonga).Rep Weeks should see the stars appear for not just the Pacific nations but Lebanon, Italy, Wales, Scotland, Serbia and so on. Malta played their opening World Cup 2021 qualifier against Ukraine a week after the Rep Weekend without their England- or Australia-based pros, such as London Broncos star Jarrod Sammut. Defeat leaves their dreams of a first World Cup appearance already hanging by a thread. Fixing the incoherent international calendar should be high on the to-do list for the new RLIF leadership.Brian McDermott’s sacking by Leeds on Monday morning had me spluttering over my corn flakes. Even after seven straight league defeats, it’s a surprise that Leeds have swung the axe now and not waited until October. It was unlikely McDermott would be there to see the complete evolution of his new team, but in eight years coaching Leeds he proved himself one of the code’s greatest. Yet his dour public demeanour made him strangely unloved by some Rhinos fans, let alone their rivals. Although he could be intimidating, he was usually reasonable and professional, and there seemed a remarkable mutual loyalty with his players. He may feel Leeds have betrayed that. No coach could produce many wins with the injury crisis Leeds have now, and few would have bounced back from their horror 2016 to win the title a year later.Big Mac will be in demand. He could even reunite with his former Harlequins boss Ian Lenagan at Wigan, with former Leeds prop Shaun Wane returning to Headingley in 2019.Leigh’s late comeback at Toronto on Saturday night restored pride but left them three worrying points adrift of the top four. While the Wolfpack are clear at the top, the other three play-off places are being fought over by five clubs separated by just four points. This weekend Toulouse host London and Halifax face Featherstone. Leigh will have to win their last four and hope for the best. Below them the ide between haves and have-nots has become a ten-point chasm. A fortnight ago, the top six played the bottom six and the winning margins ranged from 34 to 64 points. Last Sunday Fev put 80 on bottom club Rochdale. Ouch.A last word on Denver. The 19,320 attendance was the largest ever to watch rugby league in the US. A figure of 27,853 was given for the USA v Canada game in 1995, but that was the crowd for the CFL clash between the blink-and-you’ll-miss-them Baltimore Stallions and Toronto Argonauts at the much-missed Memorial Stadium played after the curtain-raiser.The Denver gate was as many as watched the previous two highest-profile exhibition games in the US put together: 12,439 at the 1987 New South Wales-Queensland game at Long Beach and an estimated 7,000 at Wigan v Warrington in Milwaukee in 1989 (the official attendance of 17,783 was pooh-poohed at the time).Follow No Helmets Required on Twitter and Facebook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7729cc6ad8ddff670046684f8434208447a45fe8/0_123_1991_1195/master/1991.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a87f81224f5022109ed786390e02fd3","title":"hoverboards why they havent got off to a mcflying start","story":"The gadgets inspired by Back to the Future Part II’s floating skateboards have failed to deliverWe could start by saying “they” didn’t promise us hoverboards. People want hoverboards because they saw one in the disappointing sequel Back to the Future Part II . But that doesn’t mean people haven’t tried to make them. Like other colourful retrofuturist fantasies, hoverboards were a lustmotif that spoke to a whole generation in the way that flying cars and jetpacks did to baby boomers.Problem No 1: how would this thing hover? We have four choices: some type of thrust, a cushion of air, maglev or magic. If it sits on a cushion of air, it is probably a hovercraft, which have been around since the 1960s. One alarming effort by Airboard originally claimed to be a genuine hoverboard but turned out to be a personal hovercraft, looking more like an industrial floor scrubber you can ride. Essentially a floaty scooter, its noisy internal combustion engine allows it to bob about menacingly on a cushion of air, with a drive wheel on the ground to steer it. Looks fun but it doesn’t hover, isn’t a board, and people just don’t want to be seen on a giant lawnmower. If our hoverboard uses maglev – and we have a few examples of those – it inconveniently requires superconductors, cooled with liquid nitrogen to around -135C. Naturally, it also requires a magnetic surface. But they do look the part. First up, California-based company Arx Pax’s Hendo hoverboard. Watching the demo, it feels ostensibly close to that skateboard ideal – it looks a riot to ride, with whooping trialists gleefully floating about 15cm above the floor. But on closer inspection, it screeches like a defective train and is so hard to control even professional skateboarder Tony Hawk spins like a top until he is flung off. And unfortunately the battery lasts just a few minutes. And $10,000 (£7,500) a pop? Next! But what if this tech were extended to an entire skatepark, as carmaker Lexus has done with its Slide hoverboard? Perhaps the closest example yet to Marty’s machine, this gadget houses a liquid nitrogen-cooled superconductor to float above a hidden magnetic track. It keeps the board in place using “quantum locking” – a property of type 2 superconductors that overcomes the tendency of magnets to wobble off and repel each other, using a sort of magnetic, sticky “vortex”. Slide certainly brings us a mite closer to Marty – it looks the part, glides quietly – but there’s no getting away from the fact that, as with any maglev, it needs a special surface. It might be well hidden but there’s still a magnetic track under that skatepark. And that won’t satiate a public hungry for Marty McFly kicks. What about conventional thrust propulsion? The US company ArcaSpace comes admirably close to the ideal with its ArcaBoard. It’s capable of hovering a foot in the air, by dint of its 36 electric propellers generating 200kg of lift controlled by onboard balancing tech to help stabilise it. You can even control it using an app on your smartphone, which is neat. You might only be able to catch some sweet air on this for three minutes, but it’s surely a great start. The drawback – ah, there’s always a drawback – is that there’s no disguising the fact that it looks like a mattress with fans on it. It hardly radiates skateboard chic, and many may balk at forking out $15,000 for a flying carpet. And there doesn’t seem to be much evidence that the rider can control it. What’s the point of a skateboard you can’t do sick tricks on?Then you’ve got flyboards. These are not so much floaty skateboards as flying platforms. The best known example is perhaps Franky Zapata’s jet-propelled Flyboard Air, which evolved from an earlier invention, those funky-looking water-jetpack gizmos also called flyboards – you may have seen beautiful people enjoying them on YouTube. The Flyboard Air is a jet-powered “personal aerial vehicle” capable of vertical takeoff and landing, and can fly at a height of 150 metres at 87mph. While it has obvious emergency and military applications, it was designed to be flown safely, sans licence, by almost anyone who takes a shine to it. A flight lasts 12 minutes but Zapata anticipates longer trips in the future.Canadian inventor Alexander Duru’s Omni Hoverboard is a similar contrivance, which uses fans to create the requisite thrust. It’s essentially a large, rideable drone – think giant desk fan with bootstraps. Its first iteration wormed its way into the Guinness World Records book in the rather uncrowded category of longest hoverboard flight – 276 metres – and the firm is working on a consumer version.Both of these, like many of the drone-derived technologies arriving on the scene, look great fun – even practical – but the nagging problem is … they aren’t skateboards. Last but definitely least are those upright, dweeby, hands-free Segways marketed as hoverboards by Swegways, Airwheels and so on, readily available at any Argos. On any given day, one might see poseurs trundling along the pavement on them, upsetting dogs. These may be fun, but the main sticking points here are that: (a) they aren’t boards and (b) they don’t hover. And they have even been known to set your feet on fire. What a let-down. McFly would have spat out his cornflakes. Surely the real test of a genuine hoverboard is, can you do a sweet flipkick on it? If the answer is no, it won’t do. Back to the Future? More like back to the drawing board."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da679d274723164b1554390889eae2ee1e9a64d5/137_0_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db6730310859c5334ae530477100cc5f","title":"samsung galaxy s8 s9 phones sent photos random contacts","story":"Firm is investigating reports that default messaging app sent pictures without consent Samsung is investigating reports that its default text messaging app on the Galaxy S8 and S9 smartphones is sending photos to random contacts without permission.Users posted complaints on Reddit and Samsung’s support forums about a strange issue that appears to be silently sending photos to random contacts.

But what is the best way to say sorry? It was Elton John, pop’s wisest banger merchant, who once said: “Sorry seems to be the hardest word,” and Elt and Blue were right about that. It’s especially tricky for celebrities. In a culture that has realised unchecked behaviour that damages others is not cool, more and more famous people have had to issue public apologies for things they’ve done, said or tweeted. In 2016, a group of conflict management researchers found that apologies that adhered to the following five-point structure were most likely to be seen as sincere:➻ An expression of regret – ie the actual “I’m sorry” (but, importantly, not a justification)➻ An acknowledgment of responsibility➻ A declaration of repentance➻ An offer of repair➻ A request for forgivenessUsing those guidelines let’s find out which apologetic celebrities meant it the most …Earlier this year we all remembered Roseanne Barr existed when her sitcom started up again for some reason. Then it got cancelled. A 1.45am tweet about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett that compared her to “Planet of the Apes” got flagged to ABC who pulled the hit reboot. Barr’s apology was, all told, “very bad”: she blamed insomnia drug Ambien, retweeted almost 100 meme tweets from her followers that seemed to back up her original sentiment, then pleaded, “I honestly thought she was Jewish and Persian-ignorant of me for sure”, which doesn’t really explain or justify the early morning racism at all. Back to Sorry School with you, Roseanne. 15To herald the launch of Arrested Development season five, the cast of the show did a roundtable interview with the New York Times that drew criticism for the way male cast members spoke over Jessica Walters’s emotional retelling of hostile behaviour she experienced working with co-star Jeffrey Tambor. Jason Bateman was particularly mansplain-y in the transcript, and apologised in a series of tweets, starting: “Based on listening to the NYT interview and hearing people’s thoughts online, I realize that I was wrong here.” By the metric, it was a good apology – Bateman said “sorry”, acknowledged he was in the wrong, and offered repair – but it shouldn’t take people online telling you that you should’ve apologised to someone when you were in the room with them crying. 45Jama’s apology earlier this year was one of my favourites of the genre, because it involved apologising for an apology, which is nowhere to be found on the five-point chart. After fans found old tweets from 2012 where the Radio 1 DJ shared a joke at the expense of dark-skinned black women with the caption “Looooooooool”, Jama quickly tweeted “My genuine and sincerest apologies go out, not just to dark-skinned women but to ALL women,” which was a real zero out of five. A follow-up explained how what she did was bad, but not much by way of repair or asking for forgiveness.

The ensuing apology was, by a chart I am beginning to begrudge, good: Homme said sorry, explained without justifying, did some forward-looking to a time where he doesn’t kick photographers in the camera so hard it hits them in the face (“Yeah, I’m gonna have to figure out some stuff I think”) and even went so far as to apologise to his wife, brother and children. Hate to have to say this about a man who kicked a photographer in the face but: good apology. 45Rita Ora’s entire career is a performance art piece about how you can achieve success by being loved and loathed by the same number of people at the same time. With the release of hit banger Girls, that theory was proved correct: some camps called it an anthem, while others – including queer artist Hayley Kiyoko – criticised lyrics that presented same-sex feelings as something you catch after a good bottle of wine. Ora’s ensuing iPhone-notes-screenshot apology won a number of fans over, but others labelled her soft coming out – “I have had romantic relationships with women and men … this is my personal journey” – as cynical. Once again, Ora’s Theory of Universal Balance comes through. 55Exemplary form from the Full Frontal host: after calling Ivanka Trump a “feckless cunt” in a monologue about the missing migrant children story that has dominated headlines, Bee backpedalled when critics and fans called her out for using a gendered insult. “It is a word I have used on the show many times, hoping to reclaim it,” Bee explained. “This time, I used it as an insult. I crossed the line.” She then went on to apologise, explain, make good for the future and throw in a joke about Ted Cruz, before finishing on: “I should have known that a potty-mouthed insult would be inherently more interesting to them than juvenile immigration policy.” Watch and learn, Roseanne. 55"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e946f935464c4cc9e2dd854d59712ff0e7261ec/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b386ed19db8ae1549228afbb57bc93","title":"need some vitamin sea heres the ultimate beach playlist","story":"Wax down your surfboard, roll up your jacket sleeves and let this music transport you to the west coast waves of Cali and the rich heat of MiamiAmerican beaches are hot, hazy places, as well as woozy states of mind, especially if you’re dreaming about the west coast around LA and San Diego, or the sun-baked strip of Miami. Music can provide handy shortcuts in sound to these locations, too. A wobble of surf guitar – wham – you’re in a Pacific picture postcard. A swagger of slow, southern rap – you’re cruising down Ocean Drive. Alongside the tons of sun-spun US classics, there are lesser-known scorchers too, so let’s wind down the windows for all of them, and let the speakers run hot.Let’s begin with the “king of the surf guitar” himself, Dick Dale, who was born in the entirely inappropriate northern outpost of Boston, Massachusetts. Misirlou began life as a slow, Arabic song from the Mediterranean, first released in the US by Turkish singer Theodotos “Tetos” Demetriades in 1927. Dale sped up the track like a Cadillac bombing down an ocean highway. Next up are the Beach Boys – of course – introducing us to the Californian dreams that they made in pop’s early days. Instead of Surfin’ USA and Surfer Girl, enjoy this gorgeous 1963 album track, which summons up the magical aura of American beach life: “Smell the warm and salty air  See a wave reflect a beam ... Make it real your summer dream.”Then let’s have Marlena Shaw, and the west coast’s own surfside creation myth. “And if you listen carefully  The winds that ride  On the high tide  Whistle a melody,” Shaw explains. “So the people started to sing  And that’s how the surf gave birth untold  To California soul.” A dubious theory, Marlena, but when you’re wearing sunglasses, it’s totally convincing. After that euphoric rush, let’s go for full American heat with Jan Hammer’s Miami Vice Theme, guitars forcing balmy winds through your lustrous 80s hair, and hot, shiny synths rolling up your jacket sleeves.Catch your breath with the Thrills – whose Deckchairs and Cigarettes is an ode to the slowed-down loveliness of San Diego and the soft glow of youth – and the beauty of Through My Sails from Neil Young and Crazy Horse’s Zuma. Named after LA’s long, sandy beach, the album ends on this beautiful, seaside song: “I’m standing on the shoreline  It’s so fine out there,” they sing. We hear more of these feelings in Miley Cyrus’s Malibu, from her latest album Younger Now, where peace comes from the ocean, literally and metaphorically: “Next to you  The sky is so blue  In Malibu.”Now it’s time to wind down as the sun slowly sets. Before we do, let’s remember that the biggest summer hit of recent years was made in Miami. The earwormy Spanish guitars and sweet nothings of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s Despacito took it to No 1 for a record-breaking 16 weeks in the US. Then we fade out with two more beachside classics, all about the memories and promises the golden shores of America give us: Don Henley’s the Boys of Summer and the Mamas and Papas’ California Dreamin’. Even when the sun goes down, we’ll be safe and warm with these songs. Our love for them will still be strong.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd84e2e39b4ac5870c61a1ab52055bd6cbfb7517/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10472673534ba47aa11bdcedb6d38955","title":"pacific hymns the definitive hipster playlist","story":"Seattle, Portland and San Fran aren’t just cities – they’re states of mind, man. So if you’re looking for counterculture sounds, it’s here you’ll find songs that spoke for a generationImmersion in Seattle’s music scene begins minutes after disembarking at Sea-Tac, the city’s international airport, which houses a store devoted to the record company Sub Pop. In 1988, the then shoestring Sub Pop Records released Nirvana’s debut single it subsequently became as synonymous with Seattle as Motown is with Detroit. Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse. Witness the contrast of Fleet Foxes’ Sun it Rises, a yearning choral-Americana hymn to frontier spirits, with avant-hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces. Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dff36481b8ad9f6f66ccb68dcaa889c59fb4c05d/0_165_5176_3106/master/5176.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98cb2de76c218fce0ec60b1a9283ff03","title":"andres manuel lopez obrador election mexico leftwing resistance","story":"Andrés Manuel López Obrador won by convincing Mexico a change of regime was possible without a civil warThis Sunday, Andrés Manuel López Obrador became the president-elect of Mexico. He won because he convinced a majority that through him, a change of regime in Mexico can be achieved through peaceful means – and without igniting a civil war. It will be a first in our nation’s history.In his final campaign speech, López Obrador announced that his government will push for a “peaceful-but-radical” transformation. He then added that “we haven’t made all this effort merely for cosmetic changes, for lip service”.The task ahead is monumental due to four major challenges Mexico faces today: violence, corruption, inequality and Donald Trump. Their resistance to his government will be vast and the outcome, uncertain.To understand the significance of this moment, we need to look to the history of the left in Mexico, and how it has confronted countless massacres, assassinations, electoral fraud and smear campaigns over the years. Indeed, Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s life story is intermingled with this movement.Before 1968, leftwing parties were marginalized or irrelevant. When a student movement appeared that year, peacefully demanding less state violence and more liberties for the citizenry, the president at the time sent his guards to shoot into a defenseless crowd. The night of Tlatelolco continues to be engraved not only on inidual memories, but on our collective consciousness as well.Out of this tragedy was born the generation of transition. Some took up arms, while most of us employed peaceful means as we continued to further the agenda of ‘68 as professors, journalists, activists, labor organizers, or professional politicians representing newly created political parties. We also dedicated ourselves to reconstructing past events in order to convey them to subsequent generations. These efforts have formed part of the Mexican transformation. In the 1970s, the modern human rights movement was born in order to attend to the victims of the dirty war against the guerrillas, later encompassing many other issues as well. Moreover, leftwing parties were legalized and, in the presidential elections of 1988, achieved a basic understanding with the party on the right in order to transform the voting ballot into a lever for change. In the 80s began an alternation that gradually undermined the governing party (PRI).Then, in 1994, we saw the strength of the nonviolence. In Chiapas, marginalized indigenous peoples rebelled and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation announced that it was launching an offensive against the “nation’s capital, to defeat the army”. Once the fighting began, the social and political left poured out into the streets, demanding a cease-fire from the government and from the insurgents. Both government and insurgents acceded to the petition and by the presidential elections that year, the Zapatistas would join in the demand for “free and democratic elections”. Out of that crucial moment came the great electoral reform of 1996, permitting the defeat of the governing party (PRI) in the year 2000. With Vicente Fox of the rightwing Pan began one of the unhappiest stages of the transition, because he betrayed his democratic commitments. Graver still, the three major parties (and that includes the leftwing PRD) were contaminated with corruption and inefficiency, while the state weakened and de-facto powers emerged, notably organized crime.During the Fox administration, the career of López Obrador as a presidential candidate began. As the head of government of Mexico City, he stood out for his personal honesty and a reasonably efficient administration, distanced from radicalism. In 2006, he competed for the presidency. Although he led in the polls, he lost due to strategic errors, personality defects, and massive electoral fraud. In 2012, he made another attempt and failed, although his ceaseless nationwide canvassing allowed him to build a new kind of political and social base.He learned from these lessons and in 2018, unfurled an impeccable campaign that took advantage of the errors of his adversaries and the disrepute of corrupt and inept parties. López Obrador is backed by a formidable coalition of political, social, and cultural forces built on a foundation of veteran leftwing organizations that have tolerated the alliances the candidate has chosen to make with conservative organizations.Today, the future of Mexico is being forged. Let us indulge in a brief moment of celebration that the Mexican left has resisted aggression and temptation without altering its faith in nonviolence – and that it has been rewarded for its perseverance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69bfaee41ee2f082caaf089d346f92af7ac41734/89_4_4508_2706/master/4508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5283e8bc7d43d224132246c384f5556","title":"doubts raised over merkel compromise on border controls","story":"Junior partner in coalition has previously objected to plan, and Austria may retaliateA plan for a new border regime in southern Germany, struck on Monday night by Angela Merkel and her hardline interior minister to defuse a bitter row in the coalition government, is coming under heavy scrutiny.The border deal, hailed by the German chancellor as a “good compromise”, foresees setting up so-called transit centres on the country’s southern border, where asylum seekers who have already been registered in other EU countries will be held until they can be sent back to those countries.Like “airside” areas at international airports, the centres would be located on German soil in geographical but not legal terms, making it easier to deport people held in them.The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, had threatened to resign over the issue of immigration on Sunday night, but the deal has allowed Merkel to avert a fallout between her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union (CSU).However, critics say the scheme is at worst unworkable and at best merely moves the political crisis to another part of the coalition.The transit centre scheme was proposed in 2015 by a CSU politician, Stephan Mayer, but was rejected in the strongest terms by the Social Democratic party (SPD), then and now a junior partner in Merkel’s grand coalition government.Three years on, the centre-left SPD, wary of fresh elections, may feel less inclined to provoke a new crisis, but it could again reject the proposal at a meeting with members of Merkel’s bloc in Berlin on Tuesday. The party leader, Andrea Nahles, said on Tuesday morning that she opposed the term “transit centres”.The proposal could also shift the political crisis south to Austria, where the government said it could take its own measures to protect its borders.The compromise deal between Merkel and Seehofer suggests refugees arriving at the Austrian-Bavarian border who were first registered in EU states that now refuse to take them back, such as Hungary, should be sent back to Austria.A position paper by the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, and his deputy, Heinz-Christian Strache, of the far-right Freedom party, quoted in Austrian media on Tuesday, said: “Should this agreement form the position of the German government, then we will see ourselves forced to take actions to avoid disadvantages for Austria and its population.”Later Kurz told journalists in Strasbourg that any domestic measures introduced by Germany would have a knock-on effect. “It could well mean that Austria too would need to react that,” he said.Seehofer said on Tuesday he had already discussed a possible solution with Kurz.Meanwhile, migration experts have criticised the border arrangement proposed by Merkel and Seehofer. “The German government has truly made a mountain out of a molehill,” said Gerald Knaus, the architect of the 2015 migration deal between the European Union and Turkey.Knaus, the director of the thinktank ESM, said the deal struck by the German government could have the unintended consequence of increasing migration into Germany, if for example the Greek government used the new agreement to unite families with people who had already arrived in Germany, while in return taking back some asylum seekers who have been fingerprinted in Greece.In addition, Knaus said, the emphasis on transit centres would mean Bavaria bearing most of the administrative burden of registering and processing refugees and migrants who arrive in Germany.Additional reporting by Jennifer Rankin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a9a7ede55a99d625a2d39ffbc410ed8427e366d/0_58_3722_2233/master/3722.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3ef46e85dbbfd765ae453e354681f9f","title":"german border deal how might it work and what are the obstacles","story":"The CDU and CSU have proposed setting up transit centres but questions remainAfter weeks of tensions within the conservative alliance of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) over Germany’s handling of refugees and migrants, the chancellor, Angela Merkel (CDU), and her interior minister, Horst Seehofer (CSU), claim to have reached a compromise.  Germany is to establish so-called transit zones along the southern border in Bavaria to facilitate the accelerated removal of refugees and migrants who have no entitlement to seek asylum in Germany. The decision aims to bring to an end a longstanding row over Germany’s asylum policy, sparked by the refugee crisis of 2015, which has proved the biggest challenge in the almost 14 years of Merkel’s chancellorship. But questions loom over a deal that both Merkel and Seehofer are claiming as a victory, not least how it can be effectively implemented and whether it will get the approval of the CDU and CSU’s other partner in the grand coalition, the Social Democrats. The SPD roundly rejected a similar proposal by the CDU in 2015. The deal follows weeks of conflict, with Seehofer threatening to unilaterally close the Bavarian border to people who had applied for asylum elsewhere in the EU – a move that Merkel rejected because of fears it would threaten the EU partnership and could lead to the end of the passport-free Schengen zone. The row has threatened to bring down Germany’s coalition government. The CDU and CSU have agreed that so-called transit centres are the most effective way to secure Germany’s southern border, through which most of the newcomers have arrived, and to ensure that refugees whose asylum cases are the responsibility of countries other than Germany can be prevented from entering German territory. According to the plan, asylum seekers who have already registered in other countries with whom Merkel has secured a bilateral deal can be deported back to the relevant country after a short stay in the transit centre. There they would have their case for asylum heard according to EU rules. Others would be returned immediately, without entering the transit zone, if the EU country from which they have travelled has not signed up to a bilateral deal. The main obstacle to this is that so far no deal has been secured with Austria, from where most refugees arrive in Bavaria, and it remains unclear whether Austria will be prepared to sign up to such a deal. So far the Austrian government has said it will wait to see details of the German proposal before deciding how to proceed, but a government spokesman said the country was preparing to tighten its border controls. The rules are confusing and likely to be complicated to implement. The zones or centres could feasibly be fenced or guarded metal container accommodation or tent camps. They would be located directly on the border in so-called exterritorial zones – that is to say, on German soil but, legally speaking, not in Germany. The asylum seeker would be obliged to live and sleep in these contained buildings and would undergo a fast-track administrative process. During this time the asylum seeker would not be entitled to leave the transit zone. It remains unclear for how long an asylum seeker would be detained at the border. There are some suggestions it could be around a week.  The SPD has to agree on the compromise. In 2015 when something similar was proposed by the CDU, it rejected the idea, likening transit zones to detention centres for refugees, and in some cases comparing them to concentration camps. Criticism has also come from the police, whose presence will be vital in ensuring the transit zones work. Jörg Radek, deputy chair of the police trade union, has called the idea “an old chestnut”, pointing out that its main flaw is that it is limited to the 500-mile German-Austrian border. Germany’s remaining stretch of border is around 1,860 miles long. The police argue that many people enter Germany outside of the main control points (there are currently three of them) on the German-Austrian border. Legally, those who do so will not be able to be put into transit centres, as they will already be miles away from the border. Arguably the new system would encourage people to enter Germany illegally along the vast swathes of so-called “green border”. In the short term, maybe, but after such a personal and chronic squabble, which has exhausted any trust that may once have existed between the long-term rivals, it is hard to see how they can continue to work together effectively.  As to whether it was worth it to have pushed the coalition government to the brink of collapse, the CSU will have to wait until 14 October, when Bavarians will go to the polls for a state election, to find out. The CSU wants to claw back the thousands of votes it has lost to the rightwing populist Alternative für Deutschland, but opinion polls suggest the row has done little to increase trust in the party.

In a previous mafia case in which he was not charged, Scopelliti was described in court documents as being “sponsored” by one of the ruling clans of the ‘Ndrangheta. Prosecutors also alleged in records seen by the  that the most powerful criminal clans in the area played a “crucial role” in Scopelliti’s political career. There is no suggestions that Salvini has any direct ties to the criminal organisation. But the  has examined Salvini’s ties to iniduals who are alleged to have close links to the ‘Ndrangheta, because of the interior minister’s role overseeing law enforcement and domestic security.The claims come as Salvini attempted on Tuesday to demonstrate his anti-Mafia priorities by ing into a swimming pool at a Tuscan villa that was confiscated from a mobster.The minister then swam a lap in the pool. The villa was seized from a mafia boss in 2007 after 24 years of legal procedures and turned into a resort.Salvini has also engaged in a public dispute with one of Italy’s most outspoken anti-mafia campaigners, the writer Roberto Saviano, who is a  contributor.Last week Salvini threatened to remove Saviano’s police protection, even though Saviano has been under threat from the Camorra since he published Gomorrah, his breakthrough book about the mafia in Naples, in 2006.Giovanni Tizian, a Calabrian journalist for L’Espresso who has lived under police protection since 2011 after being threatened by the ‘Ndrangheta, told the  that Salvini’s electoral gains in Calabria – from having virtually no support five years ago to winning office – “relied on the support of men with a troubled past and a dark political history”. A spokeswoman for Salvini declined to comment.Scopelliti became an important person in Salvini’s political orbit last December, when – before his arrest a few months later – the former mayor declared at a political rally that he would support Salvini and that “side by side” he would build a future with the far-right leader. Even though he had not then been charged with any crimes, Scopelliti was already known for alleged ties to organised crime.Scopelliti’s house was raided by prosecutors in 2016 following an investigation that revealed the existence of a so-called cupola, a secret association of ‘Ndrangheta godfathers and politicians who made decisions in Calabria and helped influence people’s votes. According to investigators in the carabinieri, the military police who led the operation, Scopelliti’s own involvement in politics had been the result of “the decisions of the mafia’s business interests”.One month after Scopelliti announced his support, Salvini – a native of Milan – took advantage of a feature of Italy’s new electoral law and decided to run for parliament in Calabria, despite his northern roots. It was seen at the time as part of his strategy to try to make gains in southern Italy, despite the League’s long track record as a northern secessionist party. It was a bold move. In 2013, the year Salvini took control of the League, his party won just four votes in Rosarno, the town that is also a major stronghold of the ‘Ndrangheta.He had reason to be cautious. In 2017, 12 local governments in the region of Calabria were dissolved because of mafia infiltration. Shortly after he decided to run in Calabria, Salvini agreed an official alliance with Scopelliti’s political party, the Movimento Nazionale per la Sovranità.Against the odds, given his party’s history, Salvini was elected in Calabria in the 4 March election. He now officially serves as a senator representing Calabria, having won about 49,797 votes there. The Five Star Movement, the populist party, won the region overall as part of its sweep of southern Italy.On 17 March, Salvini attended a rally in Rosarno to celebrate the victory. According to La Repubblica, the rally in Rosarno was attended by key members of the ‘Ndrangheta’s clans, including members of the Bellocco clan, one of the most powerful mafia crime families in Calabria. One month later, Scopelliti was arrested and convicted for forging official documents while he was mayor. He is now serving a prison sentence of nearly five years. Scopelliti has denied having any connections to organised crime.There is no evidence that Salvini and Scopelliti had a close personal relationship. The League’s relationship with Scopelliti was reportedly managed by the party’s regional coordinator in Calabria, Domenico Furgiuele, whose father-in-law, a hotel developer, was previously convicted of mafia-related crimes.Furgiuele has also faced police scrutiny. In 2012, records show, he asked his father-in-law to reserve rooms in his hotel for two men who, it later emerged, had committed a mafia-related murder in Vibo Valentia. He was never charged with wrongdoing but was questioned by police, according to La Repubblica.“I had no idea they killed a man. I’m a victim of a misunderstanding. A man asked me a favour, if I had space in the hotel for two of his friends. I didn’t know them,” he told La Repubblica.When asked about links between the League and the ‘Ndrangheta, Salvini told reporters that he was only interested in the campaigns against the mafia.Since he became interior minister, Salvini has said fighting the mafia is one of his priorities. But he has also made two policy proposals that could benefit iniduals involved in organised crime: eliminating a limit on all-cash transactions, which helps to curb money laundering and tax evasion, and a broad amnesty of iniduals who are being investigated for tax fraud – under a certain limit – as part of a plan for “fiscal peace”. The Five Star movement quashed the plan.

Met Éireann said high pressure will continue to dominate the weather pattern with a status yellow weather warning for drought or near-drought conditions for the entire country in place until midnight on Friday. Met Éireann forecaster Jean Byrne said there had not been rainfall in a lot of the country since Wednesday, June 20th. “There was some rainfall in parts but there’s been drought up to now in the east and south east but our advisory says that will become even more widespread this week,” she told The . “There’s no great change at all for the rest of this week and probably continuing into the early days of next week. “Our charts go up to 10 days and they’re showing no change Monday through to Wednesday next week.”Ms Byrne said Met Éireann will review the drought warning over the coming days and whether it may be extended. Tuesday is expected to be warm and dry with good sunshine with highest temperatures of 27 degrees. Patchy cloud will develop in southern coastal areas on Tuesday night with minimum temperatures between 9 and 14 degrees. Wednesday is forecast to be warm and dry in most areas with sunshine. However, cloud will increase from the south and a few scattered showers will develop during the afternoon and evening, most likely in parts of Munster and Leinster. Highest temperatures will be between 22 and 28 degrees with sea breezes developing in coastal areas. There will be a sunny start in the east and south on Thursday, which will give way to cloudier, hazier conditions from the northwest during the afternoon. There will be cloudy conditions with the odd spot of drizzle in northern and western parts of Connacht and Ulster, with maximum temperatures of between 15 and 18 degrees. By contrast, sunnier conditions in southern and eastern parts of Leinster and Munster will see highs of 25 degrees achieved. Friday will see a return to dry, warm and mostly sunny conditions with maximum temperatures in the low to mid-20s. The weekend is set to be warm with sunny conditions and the possibility of light showers. Temperatures may climb into the high 20s in the midlands, east and south. Fruit grower David Keeling has warned there will be shortages of fruit because of the recent drought, but they will not be as bad as feared. Mr Keeling said following the cold and long winter a lot of crops are behind, but they have been catching up with the warm weather. Growers have had to pay more attention and are using a lot more water at the moment, which means that fruit crops will be smaller and sweeter, he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Tuesday. Grain specialist Bobby Miller said it will be September or October before some tillage farmers will know the full extent of the impact of the extreme weather conditions so far this year. “The signs are there that there will be a very poor return from farming this year,” he said.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550184.1530459659!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"just three nurses recruited this year for hse relocation package","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAccording to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, there were 15 nurses recruited last year, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015. Photograph:  Frank MillerJust three nurses have been recruited so far this year as part of the HSE’s relocation package.The “Bring them Home” campaign was put in place by the HSE in July 2015, offering Irish nurses working in Britain a relocation grant of €1,500 to return to the Irish public health service.Since April 2017, an additional €1,500 is paid after a period of 12 months employment and subject to a commitment to remain in that employment for a further year. Last year, it was decided to extend the package beyond Britain to include nurses from any overseas location.There were 15 nurses recruited last year, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.The HSE said upon its announcement three years ago it was hoping to attract up to 500 staff under the initiative.Irish Midwives and Nurses Organisation general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said that while it was important to have packages to incentivise Irish nurses to come back, the current offering was insufficient.“The figures demonstrate that it doesn’t go far enough, it has to be much higher. In addition, the incentive to stay also has to be included,” she said.“What we found is some who availed of the first part of the incentive left after six months. Recruitment is only one part of the story – retention is an even bigger part. The rate of pay is too low within a global market where you can get better rates.”The HSE said it could not provide a comment on the figures at this time but pointed to the health service employment report published last May, which showed a 4.6 per cent increase in the number of nurses employed over the previous year, from 36,474 to 38,139."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3552553.1530627383!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new discovery could put an end to underarm odours","story":"Modern deodorants may be struggling to keep armpits odour-free in the current heatwave, but new research claims to have the key to making them more effective. British researchers involved in a new study have discovered that not all bacteria living in our armpit skin are responsible for causing pungent smells. And they have found a key protein involved in the release of those unwanted odours. Dr Gavin Thomas, the study co-author at the University of York, said modern deodorants work by inhibiting or killing many of the bacteria present in our underarms in order to prevent body odour. The study showed only a small population of bacteria of the Staphylococcus family take part in transforming odourless molecules we secrete through our skin glands into smelly components. “The skin of our underarms provides a unique niche for bacteria. Through the secretions of various glands that open onto the skin or into hair follicles, this environment is nutrient-rich and hosts its own microbial community,” Dr Thomas explained.The research team was able to identify an important bacterial protein involved in the process. It was found to enable bacteria to ‘eat up’ sweat compounds, therefore being the first step in producing unpleasant scents. Researchers have been able to accurately describe its atomic structure using x-ray technology.According to research co-author Simon Newstead, this discovery can also be relevant for medical science. He said understanding the protein not only was important because it is found among many bacteria, but also it resembles a human protein involved in drug absorption in our small intestines. The findings were published in the open access journal eLife on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"British researchers identify protein that helps make sweat smellyVaradkar and Coveney attend Ireland\u0026rsquos formal launch for UN Security Council seat in New YorkPope Francis, \u0026lsquounnoticed, has gradually been putting women into positions of power\u0026rsquoThe Arklow\u0026rsquos store employees will stage industrial action on Saturday over pay disputeTressa Reeves says was given the brush off by St Patrick\u0026rsquos Adoption Society when she tried to trace her sonMet \u0026Eacuteireann issues nationwide drought warning until at least Friday nightCompanies blame rising cost of energy globally for the moveJim Ferry offers cash seized by CAB to remediate site but says he will file for bankruptcyArchitect of plan says current system is inflexible and \u0026lsquoimmensely complicated\u0026rsquoAlmost 600 homes planned for former flat complex siteAround 1,000 other slopping out cases are on hold until this appeal is decidedHeadline of article had referred to \u0026lsquoNama\u0026rsquos busted tycoons\u0026rsquoGroup speaks out after court ruled hospital acted unlawfully preventing older woman with dementia from leavingMan (21) arrested in connection with death of Cork pensioner in DouglasHosepipe ban to be extended to Galway, Kilkenny, Laois, Kilkenny and parts of LimerickSix people injured when two cars collided in Co Limerick on N20 on Monday morningProgrammes measured on personal development, educational experience, and career developmentWoman found husband\u0026rsquos body in pool of blood after coming home from work"},{"url":null,"title":"tk maxx bought wicklow staff two goldfish in a bid to halt strike","story":"Workers at the TK\u0026nbspMaxx outlet in Arklow are to stage a one-day strike next Saturday in a dispute over pay, hours and rosters.The trade union Mandate said the company had “reluctantly gave a small pay increase” and even “bought two goldfish” as a “peace offering” but members wanted a permanent solution to problems.It said it had taken a case to the Labour Court in relation to banded hour contracts, pay scales and advance notice of rosters.The union claimed that TK Maxx, through the employers’ body Ibec had informed the Court that it would not be attending or heeding the Labour Court process because they had “direct employee engagement processes in place”.Mandate said the refusal of the company to allow their workers representation “has left them with no alternative but to strike”.Mandate isional organiser for Wicklow Michael Meegan said: “Once again we have a highly profitable and very successful multinational retailer refusing to engage with their workers through their representatives and ignoring the State’s industrial relations processes.

Photograph: Simon CarswellU2 frontman Bono gave his full-throated support to Ireland’s bid for a UN Security Council seat saying that “storytellers” were needed to explain the future importance of the 193-nation body.Swapping a stage of musicians for political leaders, an activist and a diplomat, the singer was the headline act at the Government’s formal launch of its campaign at UN’s headquarters in New York City on Monday night.He appeared alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney, former Irish president Mary Robinson and Ireland’s ambassador at the UN Geraldine Byrne Nason at the high-profile event on the UN’s North Lawn.The Government is pitching for one of the 10 non-permanent seats on the 15-nation council for the 2021-22 in a campaign that will run up to a secret ballot the 193-state UN in June 2020.Addressing UN ambassadors at an event celebrating Irish food, music, heritage and culture, Bono referred to political turmoil, saying an international order based on shared values and rules was “facing the greatest test in its 70-year history.”Bono warned that “we live in a time when institutions as vital to human progress as the United Nations are under attack.”He added that the existence of the European Union, the G7, NATO and the WTO were being threatened.Referring to US president Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 global climate change agreement, he said in exasperation: “Paris . . . f***k!”Mr Varadkar told an audience of several hundred people that the UN was “stronger acting together” and that “in these troubled and uncertain times” Ireland “as a global island” wanted to “play our part in defending, supporting and promoting its values.”Ms Robinson said she endorsed her country’s commitment “to do the difficult thing” and seek membership of the security council which was “not easy.”“It is a hard, hard labour of love if you really love what the UN stands for and I think Ireland really does,” she said.Mr Coveney said that with Ireland the UN knows what it would get: “a small country with big thinking, a country that listens and a strong independent voice.”In an emotive speech next to a sculpture by Dublin artist John Behan depicting Irish emigrants disembarking from a ship in New York in the 19th century, Bono evoked Ireland’s history of colonialism, conflict, famine and mass migration as experiences that make the country well placed to serve on the UN’s most powerful body.“If you look at the agenda of what the Security Council will be called on to address over the coming years: doesn’t it look a lot like us?” he said.The Irish had “not forgotten what it’s like to live in danger and desperation,” he said. “It is the air we used to breathe, even in the Dublin of my youth in the 60s and 70s.”Bono paid tribute to the UN but warned of the dangers it faced as countries such as the United States, which last month withdrew from the UN Human Rights Council, are stepping back from multilateralism.The singer said the choice was not about a seat on the security council, but about the UN as a whole.“It’s about its future and indeed whether it has one, whether its values still matter - and they better whether peace is still possible and who will speak for those normal ideas when the heat is on,” he said.Speaking on a sweltering Manhattan night, Bono said that “standing here, in that heat, the heat of a moment suffused with possibility and peril,” the UN needed “storytellers” because words mattered and that one word mattered in particular.“The word is compromise because that’s how you achieve peace and compromise is a word that the Irish people understand very, very well, It is part of our story, our recent story, and we are storytellers,” he said.“So your honorable peace activists, if you need some storytellers to describe what’s really important about this place… let us tell the story.”He urged the UN to “all become storytellers of a future we want to share” and that the story needed to be told “with imagination and passion and conviction.”“We are storytellers but this is the best story ever,” he said of the UN.Ireland faces stiff competition for the council seat from Canada and Norway, two countries with formidable records at the UN, if it is secure the required 129 votes out of 193 if it is win a seat.Bono joked that “the worst thing” he could say about Canada was that they are “nice.”“And Norway?” he said. “Who can ask for a better neighbour, a more committed peacemaker? Here’s the worse thing I can say about them: they are tall.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3551648.1530562674!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar no vanity behind irish bid for un security council seat","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar laying a wreath at UN Building in New York to Irish who died on UN peacekeeping missions. Photograph: Simon CarswellTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said there was “no vanity” in Ireland seeking a seat on the United Nations Security Council the motivation was to protect institutions such as the UN in a changing world, he said.Mr Varadkar was speaking at the UN in New York as the Government formally launched a campaign to win a non-permanent seat on the council, the UN’s most powerful body, for a two-year term in 2021-2022.“The UN is an important place where important decisions are made this is where decisions are made about where peacekeepers should serve,” the Taoiseach told reporters outside UN headquarters in Manhattan after laying a wreath to the 88 Irish peacekeepers killed over the past 60 years on UN missions.“It is where decisions are made on sanctions, it is even on occasion where decisions are made on whether or not the world should go to war. This is no vanity here this is serious stuff.”The Government has drawn criticism for applying diplomatic resources to the efforts to win a seat in the face of intense competition from Norway and Canada as a “vanity project”.Mr Varadkar told reporters that his plan to put Ireland “at the centre of the world” after Brexit meant “embracing a much wider world out there” where power was shifting to the east and south.“For Ireland to do well in this changing new world, we need to protect institutions that stand for multilateralism, institutions like the UN,” he said.Without these institutions, he added, “the big powers call all the shots”.Mr Varadkar considered the campaign to be “a good investment”. Ireland had diplomats in 80 countries but none in the another 100 countries.“This is where we meet those countries,” he said of the UN. “I think we have a really good and really important role to play in that.”Ireland’s two-year intensive campaign of lobbying will culminate in a secret ballot at the UN in June 2020, where the 193 member states will vote on the security council membership. If victorious, it would be the fourth time that the Irish have held a seat at the table, the last being in 2001-2002.Former Irish president Mary Robinson, who is helping the Government launch the bid, said that it was “probably Ireland’s most difficult attempt” to be elected on to the council.UN ambassadors were invited to U2’s concert in New York on Sunday night as part of the charm offensive behind the bid said it was a “very good soft power stroke”, as they rarely come together, she said.“Everybody’s aware that it is a very tough contest,” she said, noting that it was important for Ireland to see a council seat again “at this particular dangerous time in the world”.Mr Varadkar was joined by Vice-Admiral Mark Mellett, chief of staff of the Defence Forces, and a colour party for the wreath-laying ceremony on the 60th anniversary of Irish peacekeeping for the UN.The Taoiseach said that almost everyone in Ireland knows somebody who has taken part in an UN mission and peacekeeping was “very much part of our national identity”.“I really believe that the blue helmet, which is the symbol of UN peacekeeping, is every bit as much a symbol of Irish identity as the shamrock or the harp,” he said.The ceremony was attended by Irish UN peacekeeping veterans Jim Casey (71) and Michael Colton, who escorted the bodies of the nine Irish soldiers killed in the Niemba ambush in the Congo in 1960.“It was the worst journey I ever made,” said Mr Colton.Mr Casey said that it was “very important” that the slain peacekeepers be remembered.“A lot of people in Ireland don’t know what happened on those missions,” he said. “It should be brought to their attention and they should know what’s going on.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Najib Razak picked up from home by agents in multibillion-dollar state fund probeKey point is the fact none of the boys can swim, says veteran rescue erPhilip Wilson (67) is most senior Catholic cleric in world convicted of concealing abuseThe coach and 12 children found alive nine days after going missingTwelve boys aged 11 to 16 and their soccer coach had not been seen since June 23rdAt least 48 dead after 28-seater bus went out of control in mountainous Uttarakhand stateWorker reportedly grabbed by throat as crackdown on single-use bags angers consumersRescuers are hoping 13 missing made it to elevated rock mound called \u0026lsquoPattaya Beach\u0026rsquoExperts from across the world join mission as receding flooding offers opportunityTwo men held over incident in which child was lured away while waiting on her parentsTwelve boys and their soccer coach missing in cave complex since last weekendTwelve members of youth soccer team and their coach missing in cave complex since SaturdayVisit would mark first to North Korea since Trump-Kim summit in SingaporeProsecutors allege two women smeared nerve agent on North Korean leader\u0026rsquos half-brotherFour people on board and person on ground die in incident in India\u0026rsquos financial capitalMonitoring group says work shows need for denuclearisation deal with PyongyangStruggling economy expected to slide further as new US sanctions come into effectSearch for soccer team enters fourth day, with water proving to be \u0026lsquobiggest challenge\u0026rsquoTwelve boys and their soccer coach missing in cave in Chiang Rai province since SaturdayNavy ers trying to reach chamber deep inside cave complex in Chiang Rai province"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3551501.1530554138!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may calls on eu to show more flexibility in brexit negotiations","story":"British Prime Minister gives a statement on Brexit in the House of Commons.

Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesTheresa May has called on the European Union to show more flexibility in negotiations over Brexit, warning that parliament would reject the withdrawal agreement unless it was accompanied by clarity on a future trading relationship.Updating MPs on last week’s European Council meeting, the British prime minister said a White Paper to be published next week would set out “detailed proposals for a sustainable and close future relationship” between Britain and the EU.“I warned EU leaders that I did not think this parliament would approve the withdrawal agreement in the autumn unless we had clarity about our future relationship alongside it,” she said.“The EU and its member states will want to consider our proposals seriously. We both need to show flexibility to build the deep relationship after we have left that is in the interests of both our peoples.”Ms May has called her cabinet to an all-day meeting at Chequers on Friday to agree a common position on key issues surrounding Brexit, including customs and Britain’s future relationship with the single market. Downing Street on Monday declined to comment on reports that the prime minister had a new proposal for the customs relationship after Brexit.Earlier, Conservative ministers and backbenchers rounded on Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg after he warned the prime minister that she risked splitting her party as Robert Peel did over the Corn Laws in the middle of the 19th century.Writing in the Daily , Mr Rees-Mogg suggested that his fellow Brexiteers in the backbench European Research Group (ERG) would vote against the final exit deal if Ms May abandoned her negotiating red lines.“Any attempt by the EU to impose its laws and court on the UK, either directly or indirectly, must be rejected. Any EU agreement that restricts the country’s ability to make trade agreements with other states, restricts our ability to control our migration policy makes us pay to trade or interferes with our fishing waters could not be accepted. Indeed MPs would vote against such propositions in parliament,” he wrote.Foreign office minister Alan Duncan said Mr Rees-Mogg risked debasing “government, party, country and himself” by his insolence in lecturing and threatening the prime minister.“The PM must be given maximum latitude and backing,” Sir Alan tweeted. “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise and should pipe down.”Backbench MP Simon Hoare accused Mr Rees-Mogg of hectoring and blackmail and warned that he risked opening the way to a Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn. Another backbencher, Vicky Ford, said there was no majority in parliament for the hard Brexiteers’ vision of Brexit.“If this becomes a binary choice between staying in the single market and customs union or no deal, then I do not believe there is a majority for no deal,” she told the BBC.On Monday evening, foreign secretary Boris Johnson offered support for Mr Rees-Mogg in a complimentary tweet.“It’s vital that all MPs are able to air their views on Brexit. Whatever your position, I hope we can all agree that Jacob Rees-Mogg is a principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Indeed, Mexicans joke that “AMLO”, as he\u0027s known, mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005 and a household name, has been campaigning for the presidency for 18 years.Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Mexico\u0026#039s Jeremy Corbyn to battle \u0026#039the mafia of power\u0026#039“It’s a triumph for all the world, all the people,” he told his fans, gathered outside his home in the early hours of Monday. “It’s of millions and millions who are fed up with this regime of corruption and privilege, and who decided today to vote for a real change.“I’m going to do it. I won’t fail you.”Jose Antonio Meade, 49, candidate for the ruling PRI, conceded defeat with lightning speed, announcing shortly after the first exit polls were given, at 8pm in Mexico City, that he had lost.An experienced and well-respected politician, he was severely handicapped by representing the party of despised President Enrique Pena Nieto.Jose Antonio Meade gives a thumbs up after voting on Sunday. He was the first to concede defeatRicardo Anaya, from the conservative PAN, conceded 45 minutes later, saying he had already phoned the winner to wish him well.I recognised his triumph, I congratulated him, and I wished him success, the 39-year-old said.Once his victory became clear supporters streamed towards the Zocalo plaza at the heart of Mexico City, cheering and chanting: It is an honour, to be with Obrador.The plaza was completely full by the time he arrived to give a victory speech in which he underlined his long-time claim that he would head the biggest transformation of Mexico since the 1910 revolution - though he also stressed three times that the transition would be both peaceful and ordered.Nothing to create an economic crisis, he pledged, vowing to respect the independence of the central bank, keep taxation at its current level, and promote business.I will not let you down, he said, to wild cheers from the crowd. We are going to be ruled by three basic principals. No lying, no stealing, and no betrayal of the people. Thousands of supporters of Mr Lopez Obrador crammed into the Zocalo square in Mexico CityA thousand miles to the north, in the border city of Ciudad Juarez – from where he launched his campaign in April - cars were honking their horns as they passed his party’s headquarters, and drivers sped by waving flags, leaning out of their cars and cheering.The long-time friend of Jeremy Corbyn has been the front runner from the start, but has made an extra effort to win over the sceptical northern states. Making his third attempt at taking the presidency, he promised to defeat “the mafia of power” and usher in a new era of corruption-free rule, in which the most marginalised come first.His platform includes promises to sell the presidential jet, slash his presidential salary in two, and turn the presidential palace into a cultural centre. He has campaigned with the pledge of doubling pensions for retirees, increasing scholarships for students, and boosting production and employment in the impoverished south.How he will pay for this remains unclear – his team speak vaguely of corruption reductions freeing up millions of dollars.And he has been remarkably unspecific in his plan for dealing with Mr Trump, Nafta and the surging violence – only talking about rooting out the causes of organised crime, such as poverty and a lack of opportunities among the young, and floating a plan for an amnesty for cartel members.Mr Lopez Obrador in Ciudad Juarez on April 1, to kick off his campaignNevertheless, his message has resonated in a country exhausted by endless corruption scandals and a failure to reduce the incessant violence. As the results were announced in Ciudad Juarez two policemen were shot and injured not far from the headquarters, in another grim sign of the deteriorating security situation which both the PAN and the PRI have failed to calm, and which has driven the city to support Mr Lopez Obrador for the first time.May has been the worst month for murders in the city in seven years, and, dependent on trade with the US, the election has set residents on edge.Mr Lopez Obrador’s candidate for mayor of the city, Javier Gonzalez Mocken, who by midnight on Sunday had a narrow edge over his opponent, told The  his party was going to work on reducing the causes of cartel violence.“Lopez Obrador is looking at the reasons – the poverty and lack of hope,” he said, inside the chaotic party headquarters as the votes came in. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, casting his vote on Sunday morningHe admitted he did not agree the suggested amnesty for cartel members.“In the strict sense of the word, no, I’d not be in favour of that,” he said. “Not if they have killed people. But he’s talking about how lots of people are driving into working for the gangs through lack of opportunity. He talks about scholarships, and universities. That is good for the city.”And he said he was confident Mr Lopez Obrador would establish a working relationship with Mr Trump.He\u0027s a very serious man, he said. Both sides want a deal on Nafta, as businessmen in the US and Mexico are concerned by this uncertainty.We\u0027ve definitely been taken aback by the treatment from Mr Trump - it\u0027s been worse than any other president. We\u0027re concerned by him. So we have elected Mr Lopez Obrador to improve our relations with the US.Mr Pena Nieto addressed the nation on state television, promising to work with Mr Lopez Obrador for a smooth transition.Mr Lopez Obrador will take over on December 1.Please review our commenting policyFemale health worker arrested on suspicion of murdering eight babies at Chester hospitalFrench director abandons filming after pilot disturbs country\u0026#39s only wild flock of flamingosHusbands wrongly accused of abuse after changes to legal aid rules, charity claimsJeweller, 74, murdered for a safe code by gang who tried to rob his shop disguised in burka, court hearsHorse fly numbers surge in sweltering weather Angela Merkel\u0026#39s migrant deal is a sticking plaster for a politician now hemorrhaging credibilityThailand cave rescue: Junior football team found by British ers could remain underground for monthsVIP paedophile accuser \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 charged with perverting the course of justice and fraudMayor gunned down becomes second Philippine official killed in two daysGermany\u0026#39s political crisis spreads beyond its frontiers as Austria declares it is \u0026#39ready to protect\u0026#39 borders from migrantsFamilies of Grenfell Tower victims evacuated from inquiry due to fire alarmJapan to draw up rules of the sky for first generation of flying carsHead teacher\u0026#39s tribute to \u0026#39happy, smiley\u0026#39 Alesha MacPhail as police inquiry continues on Isle of ButeComment: Forget the Alan Partridge jokes – Richard Madeley is one of the best broadcasters we haveScottish drug deaths hit record high amid calls for radical new strategyRSPCA and National Park urges lantern festival to cancel amid fears of new wildfires Thailand cave rescue: Meet the \u0026#39A-Team\u0026#39 of heroic volunteer British ers who led searchHas Corrie character fallen victim to a superbug?

He ended up in A\u0026ampE overnight Tuesday on an antibiotic drip. “So please keep a close eye on the bite and make sure the redness doesn’t start spreading. He was the third person in that night.Another person added: Just came back from a fortnight in Ilfracombe and my parents have probably got 20 bites between them.Ilfracombe, Decon, where there have been reports of horse fly bitesWith temperatures reaching up to 30°C following a wet spring, reports of people being bitten by the horseflies are expected to continue to surge as we enter July.Ben Keywood of the Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust said: “In the UK this year we are seeing similar levels of horseflies to those found in Eastern European and parts of the Mediterranean.“The cold winter meant fewer died and now the hot temperatures in spring and early summer mean they are breeding faster and more of the brood are surviving.”Horseflies are more common in rural areas because they reproduce by biting larger mammals and lay their eggs in standing water.Although, local residents in Sheffield , Rotherham , Devon are also among those who have reported suffering from their painful bites that can last weeks.Also known as ‘clegs’ ,these large, big-eyed flies can inflict a painful bite that cuts skin rather than piercing it, often causing swelling and sometimes even infection.Experts have given tips to those who have been bitten, urging them to use insect repellent, and making sure to keep the wound clean and applying a cold compress to it.An NHS spokesman has said “anyone who has been bitten and is concerned about it should go to their local chemist, who should be able to help them in the first instance.”Female health worker arrested on suspicion of murdering eight babies at Chester hospitalFrench director abandons filming after pilot disturbs country\u0026#39s only wild flock of flamingosHusbands wrongly accused of abuse after changes to legal aid rules, charity claimsJeweller, 74, murdered for a safe code by gang who tried to rob his shop disguised in burka, court hearsAngela Merkel\u0026#39s migrant deal is a sticking plaster for a politician now hemorrhaging credibilityThailand cave rescue: Junior football team found by British ers could remain underground for monthsVIP paedophile accuser \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 charged with perverting the course of justice and fraudMayor gunned down becomes second Philippine official killed in two daysGermany\u0026#39s political crisis spreads beyond its frontiers as Austria declares it is \u0026#39ready to protect\u0026#39 borders from migrantsFamilies of Grenfell Tower victims evacuated from inquiry due to fire alarmJapan to draw up rules of the sky for first generation of flying carsHead teacher\u0026#39s tribute to \u0026#39happy, smiley\u0026#39 Alesha MacPhail as police inquiry continues on Isle of ButeComment: Forget the Alan Partridge jokes – Richard Madeley is one of the best broadcasters we haveScottish drug deaths hit record high amid calls for radical new strategyRSPCA and National Park urges lantern festival to cancel amid fears of new wildfires Thailand cave rescue: Meet the \u0026#39A-Team\u0026#39 of heroic volunteer British ers who led searchHas Corrie character fallen victim to a superbug?

The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback.

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But if you\u0027re a man and don\u0027t know who this England player is, don\u0027t feel bad.You\u0027re far from alone.Nearly half (46 per cent) of British men surveyed revealed they didn\u0027t know who Liverpool\u0027s rising star Trent Alexander-Arnold (pictured above) was. In fact, one in ten thought he was a reality TV star, politician or newsreader.Likewise, four in ten didn\u0027t know Harry Kane is England captain this summer and - this is the best stat of all - seven in ten guys suspected Belgium striker Batshuayi to be a type of cheese. Easily done. So why any pressure? Men are clearly less fanatic about football than we thought. Josh Plimmer, Sure Men\u0027s brand manager said: Our latest research has shown that not all guys will be football fanatics this summer and that, sometimes, they can feel under pressure to appear knowledgeable about football.We want guys to know they can be sport cool without needing to feel like a boffin!Alongside accepting that not all men are happy to see endless football coverage this summer, we also need to do better recognising that some women are.With Vicky Sparks crushing it as the first woman to commentate on the World Cup, this competition has been a monumental moment for women in sport - and a disappointing one, as female football pundits, journalists and fans have been repeatedly treated as invaders to a man\u0027s game.Reporters have been harassed a former footballer said women\u0027s voices are too high-pitched to commentate and Fare Network, which campaigns against racism and sexism in football, has documented 35 incidents of sexual harassment or assault - \u0027the worst sexism seen at a World Cup\u0027, according to the former executive director. More: Women invited to watch football in Iranian stadiums for first time in 37 years for next articleindy100 and its partners use cookies and similar technology to collect and analyse information about the users of this website.

In the most recent Brussels conference last week she was allowed only to make only short speech to dinner with no actual dialogue on the issue, while the main Brexit discussion took place after she had left the city.A senior UK Cabinet source suggested in June that the UK wanted to engage with the EU27 to kick-start stalled talks, but the likelihood of this happening seems limited.“Of course as the presidency in office there are various issues on the table that we haven’t chosen – I’m thinking of Brexit. Of course we’re unhappy that the United Kingdom is poised to leave the European Union but more important than that is managing an orderly departure,” Mr Kurz told MEPs.I am very grateful to the European Union’s lead negotiator, grateful to him for everything he has done. We will do our best to support him and also preserve the unity of the 27 in these matters“That is what is important. We need sound political and economic relations with the Untied Kingdom and I am very grateful to the European Union’s lead negotiator, grateful to him for everything he has done. We will do our best to support him and also preserve the unity of the 27 in these matters.”Some Brexiteers had hoped the Austrian presidency might prove more amenable with Britain’s Brexit ambitions because the country’s governing coalition includes a eurosceptic far-right party, but the central European state has taken a similar line to other nations so far.Only Hungary’s populist government has stepped out of line recently, with the country’s foreign minister warning that the failure to do a deal with Britain would be devastating for the bloc.Varadkar criticises government for not planning for Brexit before EU referendumMost EU leaders have been polite with the UK during negotiations, though some have appeared frustrated at the lack of progress and apparent deadlock in Theresa May\u0027s Cabinet. On Thursday Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said he believed the UK should have produced a Brexit white paper two years ago, or ideally before the Brexit referendum.Speaking during the same European Parliament session as Mr Kurz,\u0026nbspEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker told MEPs: We have been waiting for months now for the White Paper from No 10 Downing Street and we will analyse it once we receive it.We will not accept that the Irish issue is isolated in such a way that it is the only issue not resolved at the end of these discussions.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

That was exactly what the meeting had been about, and everybody there knew it.The summit was Operation Save Mutti. Their mission: To stop Merkel’s government collapsing by thrashing out a tough stance on immigration to calm her critics. It’s quite a turnaround.Once, Merkel, with her open-door refugee policy, was queen of Europe. Now she’s a beggar. Suddenly, European politics has changed beyond recognition.The tide has turned. Those making the case for an open Europe are haunted and chastised. They are losing elections.Italy’s new coalition of left and right-wing populists is a fiesta of political contradictions, but they share one goal: To stop the migration population from growing.They want a European refugee policy that is pretty similar to what Austria is advocating.Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s young and energetic Chancellor, has begun to talk about “an axis of the willing” between his country, Italy and Germany.He has canvassed allies in Germany for his ideas on migration reform.Many in Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are tired of her and her centrist style of leadership and see Kurz as their hero.Earlier this month he staged a press conference with Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister, coalition partner and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.Seehofer now wants Germany to turn away migrants who do not have documents or who first applied for asylum in another EU country. Merkel has refused. If the decades-old CDU-CSU alliance ends over this issue, Merkel’s government would collapse.Until recently, it was assumed that Merkel would last until the next elections in three years’ time.Now many are betting she won’t even make it through the summer.There are two kinds of European solidarity now: The Merkel type and the Kurz type.To survive, Merkel must find a way to reconcile the two, but she is perhaps the only leader in Europe who thinks that is still possible.Countries to the north, south and east of Germany have already moved away from her refugee vision.Denmark and Sweden reinstated border controls in 2015.Viktor Orban, in Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in Poland — often dismissed as loonies and fruitcakes — feel that their views on immigration have been vindicated, not just at home but across Europe. And why shouldn’t they?Much as their migration policies are flawed, they are winning the battle of ideas over border controls and openness.They have many new allies in European capitals. Slovakia and the Czech Republic now have leaders who complain about Muslim immigration.And yes, Emmanuel Macron’s victory was astonishing — but a third of France still voted for right-winger Marine Le Pen.Merkel’s view of Europe was the consensus. When Macron took power, it was hoped Europe would be purged of grubby thoughts about migrants.Merkel’s case for a common European policy on refugees seemed likely to win.But the elections in Italy and Austria changed all that. Having populists in former Soviet bloc states is one thing. Having them running Western European states is quite another.The balance of power keeps changing, shifting ever further from Merkel.The incoming Slovenian PM, Janez Jansa, is a migration hardliner and, like others in the Balkan region, sees Europe’s political future as being represented by Budapest rather than Berlin.So what to do? Merkel now stands as the charity case, not the powerbroker.Macron offers her some respite, saying he will help her by taking back the few asylum seekers in Germany who registered first in France.But far more refugees will have registered first in Italy, and the odds on its new government taking them are slim. In Austria, Kurz is focusing on a plan to force refugees to apply for asylum before they enter the EU.When Austria assumes the EU’s rotating presidency next month, Kurz will make this a centrepiece of his agenda. Kurz’s stance is unacceptable to Merkel. Belgium and the Netherlands are also protesting because they fear that forcing migrants to apply from overseas centres will lead to inhumane migration detention camps, as seen in Australia.But can Merkel fight against it?If she wants to stay in power she will need to be wary of those in her own CDU ranks who are closer to Seehofer.If her leadership recently took them to their worst election results since 1949, what might await them after more years of Merkel in power?Whatever she now chooses to do will cause her reputation to crumble.If she fires Seehofer, it may be the end of the German centre-right as the party in charge.If she goes along with Austrian and Italian demands to turn back migrants, she will be admitting that her open-door policy on migration killed her own vision of a welcoming Europe.She has run out of good options, as well as political authority. She may limp on in Germany for a few more years, but her long reign in Europe has ended.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They havent done anything wrong.“So rather than letting our emotions rule, please, lets be mature about this problem.“Now, how can we break the taboo? Well, first of all, lets stop with hate.”Child abuse campaigner Matan Uziel, who founded the Real Women Real Stories campaign group, said: “In this twisted video, Ms van der Bruggen is trying to acclimatise people to paedophilia and weirdly and dangerously enough, TEDx allows it.“Paedophilia is not merely a sexual orientation. It is a very serious psychiatric disorder.“Children are always harmed by being involved in premature sex acts for which they are neither fully physically, mentally, or emotionally ready.“I have been inundated with comments from victims of abuse who are angry and upset that TEDx allowed this to be aired.“We are calling for TEDx to remove the video from their YouTube channel immediately.”TED is a US-based non-profit group that posts free talks under the slogan “ideas worth spreading”.A spokesman told The Sun Online that TEDx talks “operate independently” of the main organisation and they don’t usually remove videos unless the speaker requests it.There were no plans to remove this one but organisers “reserve the right to”, the spokesman said, adding: “TED does not support or advocate for paedophilia.”We have reached out to Madeleine van der Bruggen for comment.Earlier this month a similar TEDx talk called “Why our perception of paedophilia has to change” was removed because the speaker “had serious concerns about her own safety in its wake”."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tp-image-cartoon.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm theresa may retreats to country bolthole chequers to thrash out brexit plan with cabinet","story":"For on Friday, Theresa May is summoning the entire Cabinet to Chequers, her country retreat, to thrash this out.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over at a Chequers meetingThis meeting is taking place far too late. Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She won’t survive conceding on any of them.We weep for Downing Street’s tactics.They seem ­terrified that the PM might have to walk out of talks. Why? If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin.

They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting. Scientists are apparently closer than ever to inventing an invisibility cloak.I’m sure it’s intended for use by top secret agents intent on saving the world.But all I can think about is what a great accessory it would be for any party at which there are people you don’t fancy talking to.Or for eavesdropping on Apprentice candidates.Or spying on the half-time huddle of any team West Ham is playing.In fact, the possibilities are endless.HONESTLY there is no pleasing some people. The number of moans I have heard this week about people who think it is too hot.Just cast your mind back to the past couple of years when it rained solidly for most of June and July – and count your lucky stars.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The victim was left uninjured but shaken by the ordeal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000416943470-e1530567648312.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"piers morgans ego ally ross tv","story":"Not despite that barnacle-brained oaf Piers Morgan, as some of you might think, but largely because of him and his complete inability to keep a lid on a dementedly competitive streak which, one minute, had him ­threatening to “gorge on the innards” of BBC rival Dan Walker, the next, saw him getting soundly thrashed by Richard Arnold in an egg and spoon race.Wiser heads, of course, would have settled for painting themselves into just one corner. Not Piers, who went on to issue a further challenge: “On Thursday night, you can watch England destroy Belgium, then watch me destroy Love Island straight after.”So I did. No further comment is needed on the first bit of Piers’ equation. But, hell on TV earth, I can’t ignore the second.A “one-off special” called Good Evening Britain which attempted to cash in on the breakfast magic and must have seemed like a great idea until England v Belgium became a loser-takes-all non-event, the wardrobe department shoved Susanna Reid into a Spanish Flamenco dancer’s outfit and someone lost control of the guest list.’Cos all of the pre-publicity for this one assured me there’d be just three present: Danny Dyer, the Labour Party leader and a slightly spooked Pamela Anderson, who set the first alarm ringing by claiming: “When they told me Jeremy Corbyn’s going to be here I thought this was going to be a serious political ­programme.”Why the hell a dissembling old fool like Corbyn would make anyone think that is a bit of a mystery, but ­serious was the last word you’d use to describe Good Evening Britain.They weren’t alone either. The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two. It’s as funny, heart-warming and brilliantly formatted as you remember. But the most remarkable thing is, hardly any of it would now be considered fit for broadcast.For not only is Jocky Wilson smoking a fag as he attempts the 301 or more challenge, Jim Bowen, can’t help drawing attention to a facial scar on a contestant’s face.“You’ve obviously had an accident, tell us how.” “I was 11 years old, it was a petrol can blew up on a building site.” “Lovely to be able to talk about that, smashing.”Broadsheet newspaper columnists, right-on comedians and other handbag-clasping s of the nation’s morals will, of course, say: “Well thank goodness we’ve moved on since then.” Which is precisely the reason none of them will ever create a show as beautiful as Bullseye or say anything remotely as funny as the bellowing climax to the prize board, on show eight.Bully’s special prize?“What every woman dreams of.

And a bite massage therapist from Hollywood called Doctor Dot failing to provide the necessary health and safety warning before she told This Morning’s Eamonn Holmes: “Ruth’s going to be biting you tonight.”’Cos she’d have bitten off more than she could chew if she did.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “Alphabetically, what day of the week comes first?” Andy: “Tuesday.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “In which decade of the 19th Century was the Crimean War fought?”Simon: “The 1950s.”Andrew O’Keefe: “TV series Twin Peaks is set in which fictional town?”Dan: “Transylvania.”“No, Twin Peaks.” NHS cultists gathered last week to applaud, grovel, sing, dance and grin like madmen in its honour.I exaggerate a bit, obviously. The singing and dancing doesn’t begin until tomorrow night on ITV.It was still an unsettling experience though, watching BBC2’s NHS At 70: Live, from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Birmingham, hosted by Anita Rani a level eight cultist from The One Show, Nick Robinson and Helen Skelton, who was in the maternity unit warning that we may “hear screaming”.As well as the massed ranks of staff, there were also NHS bigwigs and former patients who were encouraged to stand, clap and thank nurses, doctors, ambulancemen, chemists, the woman on reception, everyone.The nasty suspicion is, of course, that all this BBC worship, which makes Kim Jong-un’s birthday celebrations look really half-ar*ed, carries a political edge and is designed to shut down every single argument apart from the ones that say:A)The NHS needs more money. Or B) the NHS needs a s***load more money.As righteous as it might make them all feel, however, deep down they know it makes for wretchedly dull television.Hence the presence, on this one, of Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy, who not even the resuscitation unit could help with gags like: “Laughter is the best medicine.

Recent outbreaks have highlighted its ongoing threat.In September last year, the World Health Organisation declared that the elimination of measles had been achieved in the UK.Elimination of measles can be verified once a country has sustained interruption of endemic transmission for at least 36 months, according to the WHO.The UK has also reached the WHO target for 95 per cent of five-year-olds to receive the first dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.Its thought the sharp rise in British cases is linked to outbreaks in Europe, where take up of the MMR vaccine has been low.There have been 48 measles deaths reported in the EU since 2016 and take up of the jab is typically low in countries including Romania, France, Greece and Italy.Public Health England has called on young adults and teens planning to go abroad over the summer to check they are vaccinated.The age group is vulnerable as take up of the MMR jab fell heavily in the late 1990s following research by Andrew Wakefield which suggested a link between the vaccine and autism.However, his work was discredited and he was struck off the medical register in 2010.Numbers having the jab also dipped to a low of 80 per cent in 2003.Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications.Its now uncommon in the UK because of the effectiveness of vaccination.Anyone can get measles if they havent been vaccinated or they havent had it before.It usually clears in 7 to 10 days but can lead to other serious complications.Symptoms:Initial symptoms include:A few days later a red-brown, blotchy rash will appear, usually beginning on the head or upper neck before spreading.Youll most likely feel most ill the first few days the rash appears.Complications:About one in every 5,000 people will die from measles.Complications are more likely to develop in:The most common complications include diarrhoea and vomiting, ear infections, eye infection, pneumonia and bronchitis.But measles can also lead to other complications, although these are rare:Treatment:There is no specific treatment.Your GP will probably suggest resting at home and waiting for it to clear.You can ease your symptoms with pain killers, but always speak to your GP first.You can avoid measles by getting vaccinated.One dose of vaccine can be given to a baby when they are 12-13 months old and a second before they start school.Countries where vaccination levels are higher have less chance of the disease spreading.Source: NHS Choices Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: In the early 2000s there was a fall in MMR vaccination coverage in children and as a consequence, we are now seeing measles cases in young adults.Measles can be more serious in adults with a higher likelihood of hospitalisation and complications arising.Measles is circulating in England and the rest of Europe.We often think about what travel-related vaccines we might need before going on holiday, but its also important to check that we are up to date with routine vaccinations like MMR.If you are unsure if you have had two doses of MMR call your GP practice to check and catch up if needed.Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, added: This is so disheartening when we consider how close we came to completely eradicating this unpleasant infectious illness and achieving medicine’s ultimate goal of confining this awful disease to the history books.“Unfortunately, we had major setbacks in the 1990s when false claims about the MMR vaccine caused panic which led to a significant drop in the numbers of parents allowing their children to be immunised, and the latest figures would appear to indicate that we are still feeling the impact.We ask all parents to do the right thing, including when returning from abroad, and have their children so that we stand the best chance of permanently eradicating measles in the future.”Parents were urged to protect their kids after warnings of the deadly measles outbreaks in Europe over the Easter holidays.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The future of her Government and our democracy hinge on it. Yet her top aide Oliver Robbins reportedly intends on Friday to demand that the Cabinet signs off what amounts to a betrayal of the referendum vote.His strategy, to stay in the EU’s single market for goods, already looks fatal to regaining full control of immigration, freeing ourselves from the sway of the European Court of Justice and striking our own trade deals.And that’s before Brussels formally rejects it, as it will. Michel Barnier will then demand full single market membership, with free movement, and kill our ambition to trade independently too.What will Mrs May do then?The Sun has always believed her pledges to take back control of our ­borders, laws and money. We still agree that “no deal” is better than a bad one. But the EU is now clear that a bad deal is our only option — and Barnier admits he’s not even negotiating.Will the PM ever say enough is enough and honour her “red lines”? Or will she cross more of them? How is Robbins’ plan Brexit? It’s not.Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, David Davis and Liam Fox must not stand for it. Nor must sensible Cabinet Remainers.Voters are not dumb. They will smell a sellout instantly.It would be a national calamity — suicidal for the PM, her Government and party.“It’s not negotiation - it’s a capitulation.”Senior Eurosceptic Tories confronted the PM in the Commons yesterday to angrily demand the PM scotch other rumours that she wants the UK to join the European Economic Area alongside Norway – the ultimate soft Brexit.Sir Bill Cash branded EEA membership for Britain as “preposterous” and that it would “undermine democracy if that were true”.Mrs May replied: “The EEA would not deliver on the vote of the British people.”Sir Desmond Swayne asked Mrs May if Brexit could still be “recognised as Brexit”.To laughter from Opposition MPs, Mrs May quoted her own catchphrase to insist: “There has been much jocularity around the term ‘Brexit means Brexit’, but it does mean Brexit”.Arch Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, exploded rivalries by warning Mrs may she would split the Tories in two as Sir Robert Peel did in 1846 if she gave up her Brexit red lines to strike a deal with Brussels.The Somerset MP also called for Theresa May to stand firm for what she herself has promised.He was savaged by a series of Tory moderates, including foreign office minister Sir Alan Duncan.Accusing Rees-Mogg of “insolence”, Sir Alan accused him of “lecturing and threatening the PM”, adding: “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise \u0026amp should pipe down”.Grandee Sir Nicholas Soames: told him to “shut up” and “put a sock in it.But Sir Alan’s own boss in the Foreign Office, Boris Johnson, leaped in to defend Mr Rees-Mogg.Some pro-EU politicians want Britain to stay in the customs unionafter Brexit - but that has been ruled out by Theresa May, because it would stop us striking any new trade deals with the rest of the world.Last year, the PM set out two possible paths for the future customs relationship between Britain and Europe.One option is the customs partnership - which would mirror many aspects of the existing customs union.It would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods which enter Britain on their way to the continent.The advantage of that would be no border checks would be needed between the UK and EU, particularly on the key Irish border, but Brexiteers worry it would tie us too closely to Europe.The alternative is known as maximum facilitation - a hi-tech arrangement where automated systems check goods as they flow across borders in a way which helps business trade freely.But EU bosses have cast doubt on whether the right technology exists to make that solution work.While the row may seem technical, many Brexit backers regard it as crucial for the UK to take total control of our trade and customs arrangements, or risk making our EU departure pointless.Theresa May faces a major challenge finding a solution which is acceptable for both hardline Eurosceptics and the pro-EU Tory rebels.The Foreign Secretary tweeted: “ It’s vital that all MPs are able to air their views on Brexit.“Whatever your position, I hope we can all agree that Jacob Rees-Mogg is a principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country.”Mrs May was due to address rich Tory donors at the party’s annual summer fundraiser at the posh Hurlingham Club in West London.She will also travel to the Netherlands today to explain her latest thinking to Dutch PM Mark Rutte, and Berlin on Thursday to see German boss Angela Merkel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Children are frequently reported to experience panic attacks, bed wetting and altered behaviour when a parent is detained.The criticism comes in the wake of family separations in the United States, where images of imprisoned children screaming for the parents has prompted widespread condemnation. In the UK, Home Office regulations state that children are neither split from both their parents nor placed in detention for immigration purposes.But in less than two years Mr Beales says BID has dealt with several cases in which Home Office enforcement has meant children being taken into care.Among them are the four children of Kenneth Oranyendu, who was detained when he reported to the Home Office after dropping them off from school in March.His wife was in Nigeria for her father\u0027s funeral at the time, and the 45-year-old begged immigration authorities to allow him to pick his children up from school. But he was referred to an immigration detention centre 200 miles away, and his children placed in care.Within a few days of his arrest Mr Oranyendu\u0027s wife was able to return to the UK to collect the children, and the family are now together after he was released on bail.But he still has to report to the Home Office every two weeks, and fears he could be detained again. His children, aged between six and 17 and all British citizens, have been \"shattered\" by the separation.\"Every time I go out of the house they are afraid I\u0027m not going to come back,\" he said. \"They are terrified we will abandon them, and suffer from panic attacks. They wake in the middle of the night to check if their mum and dad are still there.\"Mr Oranyedu has a conviction for drugs smuggling - a crime he denies - and was detained by immigration detention after he served his sentence. His supporters say he is being punished twice because he is not a British citizen. The Home Office told Sky News human rights were \"fully considered\" Mr Oranyendu\u0027s case, and that his status as a \"foreign national offender\" meant protecting the public and preventing crime were taken into account.Government guidance says children must not be separated from both parents for immigration purposes, and set out that the decision to detain any parent should be \"necessary and proportionate\" with regard to the children concerned.A spokesperson said immigration procedures would not result in children being taken into care unless in exceptional circumstances, and said children\u0027s welfare and safeguarding was at the heart of family returns."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-medellin-columbia_4351190.jpg?20180702114817 ","title":"facebook gave 61 firms extended access to user data","story":"The dating app Hinge, alongside corporations including AOL, Oracle, Nisan, Panasonic and Snap were among those to receive the extended access.Mark Zuckerberg, the social media company\u0027s founder and chief executive, previously accepted responsibility for the breach ahead of a Congressional hearing.He said: \"We didn\u0027t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake.

The posh MP is jockeying for position with more than half a dozen other Tories looking to take over from Theresa May if the Brexit negotiations implode. Supporters of the Old Etonian are reported to have interviewed public relations companies with a view to working on a leadership challenge. Mr Rees-Mogg denied the claim. It comes as a Remain-backing Tory MP warned Brexiteers are plotting a \u0027coup\u0027 against the Prime Minister. A poll of Conservative supporters for the ConHome website has Sajid Javid as favourite to be the next leader, followed by Michael Gove with leading Brexiteer Mr Rees-Mogg in third place. Mr Rees-Mogg, often dubbed the “MP for the 19th Century” because of his old-fashioned style, has been steadily building up his public profile and engaging with 21st Century media.  He recently joined Snapchat, having already opened Twitter and Instagram accounts. The prominent Leave supporter has also appeared on Have I Got News For You, as well as speaking at Conservative Associations as he courts the party’s grassroots. Earlier this week it was said supporters of the millionaire have raised a \u0026pound750,000 war chest if he wants to fight a leadership campaign.  A source familiar with the recent invitation to PR firms told The Times: “They were asked to explain how, if Jacob was speaking at a university, they would go about maximising the publicity and harvesting the greatest number of supporters who could later be converted into voting Tory members.” Insiders said the real reason was to pave the way for tilt at the top job if Mrs May quits or is ousted. Senior Tory backbencher Sir Bill Cash, a close friend of Mr Rees-Mogg, said he “didn’t recognise” a claim he had been involved in interviewing potential PR firms and in raising cash Mr Rees Mogg said he had “absolutely no knowledge” of a bid to sign-up a PR firm.  It comes as the Prime Minister prepares for make-or-break talks with the Cabinet at her country retreat, Chequers, on Friday.  Brexiteers fear they are about to be ambushed with a \u0027fudge\u0027 plan for customs that will keep the UK close to EU rules.  Pro-Remain Chancellor Philip Hammond is set to use the meeting to present new analysis on the costs of Hard Brexit. One bullish Tory MP told the : “We could find the government collapses on Friday night.  If she crosses the Brexit red lines, and it looks like she is going to, then the Brexiteers will withdraw their support for her and Boris, David Davis and the other Brexit ministers will walk.” Another told the newspaper: “Pro-Brexit MPs are ready and willing to pull the trigger. Friday looks as though it could be the day that decides the prime minister’s fate.” Tory MP and former minister Dr Phillip Lee said: There is no doubt that Brexiteers are planning a coup.

We don\u0027t want to tease the FA.  Mr Thomas has a Private Member\u0027s Bill before Parliament this Friday, which would force the government to grant a public vote on its withdrawal agreement with the EU. A string of Remain-backing Labour MPs have thrown their weight behind a so-called \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027. But it is not Labour policy and the Bill is so far down the Commons \u0027order paper\u0027 that it will not even be debated on Friday. It is likely to be postponed until October 26 but may not be debated then either.

There’s lots to celebrate because we can be proud the UK is a world leader in LGBT rights. But I know that, in 2018, many LGBT people still have to deal with discrimination, hatred and even violence and I’m determined to do something about it. Last year we launched the first national LGBT survey which attracted more than 108,000 responses, making it the largest survey of its kind anywhere in the world. Some of the findings make for difficult reading. I was shocked to learn that two-thirds of people avoid holding hands in public with same-sex partners for fear of a negative reaction.  That so many people fear the consequences of this simple gesture shows that a society in which we are all treated equally and fairly is still some way off. Two in five of the people surveyed had experienced verbal harassment or physical violence simply because of their sexuality. Worse still, 90% of those people felt they couldn’t report it because “it happens all the time”. It’s for reasons such as these that we’re publishing our LGBT Action Plan, setting out the concrete steps to help improve lives for LGBT people and eliminate the discrimination and inequality they face. We are going to appoint a national adviser on health inequalities, so the specific needs of LGBT people are at the heart of the NHS. We will continue our investment in programmes to tackle homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying in schools, protecting LGBT students and confronting hatred in all its forms.

Then she suddenly drops to the floor, grinding and thrusting as if her life depended on it. Unsure of where to look or how to react, I opt for a contemplative expression, pen in hand - relieved at least that the smoky room and flashing lights are hiding my blushes. Then, when her three minutes are done, she blows over a kiss before gliding off the catwalk - and I look down at the score-sheet in front of me.  Having to mark a woman’s bottom between 0 and 10 makes me feel like the worst kind of person. But as a judge at Brazil’s bizarre Miss Bumbum competition, this is exactly what is expected of me - and as I put pen to paper the hundreds packing the room strain to work out which score I’m awarding her. One of the strangest, yet most fiercely-fought beauty pageants on the planet, in Brazil the annual contest to find the nation’s sexiest bottom is taken deadly seriously. And with the chance to become an overnight superstar at stake, hopefuls famously go to desperate lengths to take the title - from stripping off in public to bribery and even sabotage. Some candidates have been known to sell cars and even houses to finance their campaign for public votes. And now for the first time, butt-proud women all around the globe will be able to compete for an even more illustrious crown - Miss Bumbum World. Organisers said they decided to launch an international version of the contest after being inundated by messages and photos from big-bottomed women around the world begging for a chance to take part. And emotions are expected to reach fever pitch at the star-studded event in Miami in March next year, when Brazil’s national winner will compete against representatives from other countries around the world to find out who has the best butt on the planet. As the only non-Brazilian ever to be a judge on Miss Bumbum, in November last year, I was able to get a unique insight into what the race to next year’s ultimate best bottom award might be like - as well as behind-the-scenes antics and intrigue. As a journalist working in Brazil, I’ve reported on the craziest aspects of the competition - which today makes more headlines around the world than every other beauty pageant put together.  They included one hopeful who strutted naked through a shanty town controlled by gun-wielding gangsters to canvass for votes, another who was caught paying a witch doctor to cast a voodoo spell on a rival, and others who upset the Catholic country’s Christians by recreating the Last Supper scene wearing sexy lingerie at Easter. And no Miss Bumbum season is complete without a fair share of scandals and intrigue. Previous high(low)lights include allegations that one contestant had paid organisers around \u0026pound18,000 for second place others caught using computers to cast thousands of online votes and claims some women had cheated by having butt implants - the competition’s only rule is you can\u0027t. The mix of big bums and bizarreness is a recipe for unprecedented media attention. According to organisers, there have been more than 10.3 million articles written about the contest since it first began eight years ago, as well as 48 TV documentaries, including one for the BBC due to be aired in September.  And according to Brazil’s government, only the Rio carnival generates more international news about Brazil than the annual best bottom competition, where winners often go on to become household names at home and abroad. The event is so huge that Miss Bumbum’s creator, Cacau Oliver, now has his own reality show on Brazil’s E! TV channel, called Fame Maker. But nothing could have prepared me for the pressure cooker final of Miss Bumbum in a Sao Paulo bar last November, when the last 15 hopefuls - whittled down from over 2,500 candidates - got their last chance to impress before a panel of judges. Expectation was in the air as hundreds of reporters, photographers and TV cameras packed in to the Noo Bar in the city’s famous Vila Madalena district. As a guest judge I was ushered by security guards into the VIP area, where free food was laid out and I mingled with famous Brazilian stars such as funk DJ Mr Catra and Youtuber Caue Moura. I was one of ten judges - others included TV presenters and reality show stars - invested with the power to send one of the women waiting nervously in the wings to stratospheric heights. As the clocked ticked down to the long-awaited ceremony, excited showbiz reporters rushed to quiz us about our bottom preferences in the hope of gleaming some clue as to which of the 15 finalists might be crowned Queen. But the actual judging process, for such a huge national event, was surprising less rigorous than I had imagined. Each of the judges were giving a sheet with the names of the women, in the order they would appear, first fully dressed in an outfit or costume of their choosing, and second shaking their booty wearing as little as they wanted. For each appearance we were to give a mark between 0 and 10. Most notably, though, it was all about the bumbum. Forget inner beauty, personality, or even a pretty face, we were told, the only thing that mattered was the shape, size, shake and aesthetic of the ass.  By the time the first bottom wiggled on stage, this one belonging to the candidate for Rio de Janeiro, the crowd were in a state of near frenzy. Before each candidate appeared, a video showed her wiggling her bottom on a beach, as the show’s glamorous presenter Gracyanne Barbosa announced their name, age, and ass size. Gracyanne herself, while not being a great presenter, does have a 43-inch wide backside, which appeared to matter more. While some women opted for an evening gown, others were more creative, like the representative of the state of Amazonas, Rosie Oliveira, who strutted the catwalk dressed as an Indian with a huge feather headdress, before unfurling a Brazilian flag with the words “Temer Out!”, a reference to the country’s hugely unpopular president. Some of the other judges squealed excitedly and immediately scribbled ’10’ in her box.  But it was the ‘free dance’ sequence, during which the women returned to the stage to wiggle, thrust and grind their prize asset to the beat of pounding booty music, which brought the crowd to delirium. Excited photographers climbed on top of each other to get the closest shot and each of the contestants made the most of their three minutes to convince us they should be the next Queen of the Brazilian bumbum. One contestant slowly untied her bikini top as she danced provocatively to a slow ballad, another flew onto the stage as Wonder Woman and another strutted down the catwalk dressed as a sexy angel. This time Amazonas’ Rosie was dressed as a sexy jester with harlequin bikini and feathered tickle sticks hanging from her arms. When another wearing the tiniest silver G-string suddenly got on on all fours furiously thrusting her backside to the pounding beat of her chosen funk anthem, the crowd erupted in whistles and applause.  And after each performance, the room fell quiet and all eyes were on me and my fellow judges as we discussed everything from their twerking technique, roundness of their bottom, number of thrusts per second, even the amount of cellulite - before each scribbled down their score. Meanwhile, social media was going into overdrive as Miss Bumbum fans around the country followed the evening’s events, desperately wanting to know who their next bumbum idol would be. Once all the performances were over, the women retired backstage, where many sat nervously biting their nails, or pacing up and down, knowing that one bum wriggle could have made or broken them. On the competition floor, presenters made live broadcasts with their impressions and predictions. It was past midnight when, with all votes counted, the moment finally came for Miss Bumbum found Cacau Oliver to declare the winner. First, an award was made to the candidate who was the least bitchy to the others during the competition, Miss Sympathy, who was voted for by the other women. Then, as the 15 hopefuls lined up on stage, he opened the envelopes containing the name of the runner up, and the winner. And as - unsurprisingly - Rosie Oliveira was declared Brazil’s next Miss Bumbum, there were gasps of surprise and looks of sheer hatred from the other women. The 28-year-old gasped in disbelief and wiped tears from her eyes as the news sunk in, while the remaining 15 women, barely able to hide their disgust, marched off backstage without even stopping to congratulate her. But she didn’t care - suddenly hundreds of photographers were crowded around her, yelling for her to look their way as flashbulbs popped and reporters shouted questions while scribbling in their notepads.

The body of the six-year-old was discovered by police in woods on the grounds of a derelict hotel at around 9am yesterday, two and half hours after she was reported missing. Alesha was staying with her dad and gran at their home in Rothesay, Isle of Bute, when the alarm was raised. Her mother Georgina Genie Lochrane, 23, found out the heartbreaking news about her daughter after Alesha\u0027s grandmother posted an appeal on Facebook .  Genie has since been escorted by police from her home and taken to the island yesterday afternoon. Police have confirmed the body found is that of the six-year-old and a post mortem is being carried out this afternoon.  As police continue their investigation, they are recording the details of every ferry passenger travelling to and from the island, the Daily Record reports. Alesha\u0027s relatives from Coatbridge said they are shocked by the tragedy. Alan McGuire confirmed that the youngster was visiting her gran on Bute when the tragedy happened. Alan said: “Alesha would go to Bute quite often to visit her gran and this was just a regular visit.  “We are devastated about what has happened because she was a lovely wee girl. “At the moment we simply don’t know what is happening. We are waiting to hear if the police are treating it as suspicious or as a tragic accident.” His partner Lisamarie said: “I don’t want to say too much because we don’t know many facts. She was a lovely girl and this has been a shock.” Another relative said: “The family have had a lot of heartbreak in recent years but this is unbearable. “The police are investigating and at this stage we don’t know if this is an accident or something even worse.” Alesha was a pupil at Chapelside Primary School in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire and head teacher Wendy Davie paid tribute to her this morning.  She said: Alesha started with us at Chapelside Primary in August 2016 and had just finished primary two. She loved being at school and enjoyed all aspects of literacy, in particular writing. She was such a perfectionist in her handwriting and was very proud of her work. Alesha was very friendly and she welcomed everyone first thing in the morning at breakfast club. She was a very considerate child who loved being part of a group and she was popular with all the other children, and was a smiley and happy young girl. She was part of the family of Chapelside Primary and she will be greatly missed by everyone at the school. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and Chapelside Primary community at this very sad time. The area surrounding Alesha’s gran’s home, around half a mile from the spot where her body was found, was sealed off by police tape, with an officer standing guard at the cordon. The scene itself where Alesha’s body was discovered was concealed by thick foliage. A small clearing in the shrubs, which appeared to be an entrance to the grounds of the former hotel, was also taped off. Detective Superintendent Stuart Houston from Police Scotland’s Major Investigation Teams said: “This death of a 6 year old child has shocked the tight knit community of Rothesay and it is imperative that we find out what has happened.

Coastguards have warned swimmers against the use of the novelty floats after an increasing number were washed out by the tide. It comes after 15 people straddling giant unicorns and pink flamingos had to be rescued from along the south coast on Monday. In total, officials received 18 calls about people in trouble on the blow-up devices. The current heatwave, which has seen daytime temperatures hovering around 30C, has seen beaches packed and people staying in the sea longer.  Coastguards are advising the public that inflatable toys are not designed for coastal waters where they are quickly swept out to sea by winds and currents. One swimmer lounging on an inflatable unicorn got into trouble at Hayling Island in Portsmouth, Hants, meaning the Hayling Coastguard Rescue Team and RNLI lifeboats had to be launched. HM Coastguard search and rescue helicopter from Lee-on-Solent was also scrambled to look for the embarrassed day-tripper. Another man with an inflatable dinghy in the same area was also reported to be in difficulties, as were other people on a large, pink blow-up flamingo. In a tweet the Maritime and Coastguard agency urged people to leave inflatables at home, saying they should not be used in the sea.  They posted: “More than 15 people have had to be rescued this evening along the south coast. Common denominator? They were all using inflatables. Please leave them at home - they\u0027re NOT for the sea. #999.” HM Coastguard duty controller Piers Stanbury said: “We’ve had people rescued from a number of beaches along Hampshire and Sussex coastline. “Each one of them had been using an inflatable. Thankfully, everyone so far has been rescued and is safe. “We’ve had to waste RNLI and Coastguard volunteers’ time to ensure that abandoned inflatables did not have anyone at risk associated with them. “We can’t stress enough that these inflatables are not suitable for use in the sea. “Tide conditions, the wind, any changes in the weather can just take them out beyond safe depths. Please, don’t use them, don’t take them to the seaside.

The Met Office has forecast highs up to 33C this week and 35C next week - after eight days in a row already at between 29C and 33C. And the heat is forecast to remain through the second half of July and August, computer models show. Britain is hotter than 29C Barbados. The famous 1976 summer saw standpipes on the street as Britain sweltered. The heatwave has left Brits feeling uncomfortably hot with many people saying they have struggled to sleep.  Why is it so hot? High pressure over the UK is causing high levels of sunshine and clear skies. Unlike our usual hot spells that are down to warm air pushing in from the continent, this heatwave is caused by the weather lifting the temperature day on day.    How long will the UK heatwave last? Forecasters say the uncomfortable, sweaty nights show no sign of disappearing. Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said: “There’s no sign of an end to the heat. Warmth looks like continuing for the first half of July. And forecast models point to above-average temperatures for much of July and August.” What areas will it affect? Thursday looks like the peak of this week\u0027s heat, with the hottest areas in the west, while the eastern coast getting fresher weather.  Highs of 30C are expected on Thursday, with the North West getting a high of 31C.  Northern Scotland may get cooler by Thursday, while the South and West of England will remain hot through to the weekend.    When will it rain? The Met Office has issued a weather warning for thunderstorms - the first such advisory since the service was introduced. Helen Roberts added: “This week could see 33C in the second half of the week, and next week looks much like last week and could come close to 35C. “Lots of very warm, dry, sunny and settled weather is ahead, and humid nights mean it will be difficult to sleep.”  When was it last this hot? The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Parallels with the famous 1976 summer can be made. Ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weather trending said: “Hot and dry weather breeds hot and dry weather. This effect was seen in 1976. This spell ending seems increasingly unlikely through the first half of July.” Metweather forecaster Jo Farrow Paul Michael White said: “The storms are no breakdown as the heatwave will keep on cooking.” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents trial after doctors found","story":"NewsParents on trial after doctors found newborn baby suffered head injuries and bruised genitals before his deathMarina Smyth, 21, and Michael Osborne, 22, deny causing or allowing serious physical harm to Bailey Smyth-Osborne\u0026nbspShareByJulia Roberts12:05, 3 JUL 2018NewsMarina Smyth, 21, and Michael Osborne, 22, deny causing or allowing serious physical harm to their son Bailey Smyth-Osborne who was found to have suffered head injuries and bruising to his genitals before his death\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA newborn baby suffered head injuries, a bruised penis and a fractured leg before his death from pneumonia and sepsis, a court heard. Bailey Smyth-Osborne was said to have been subjected to \u0027more than one\u0027 blunt impact of mild to moderate force, as well as a yanking and twisting motion to his left limb. His penis may also have been pinched, and any trauma he suffered went beyond rough-handling, a jury was told. It is alleged one of his parents, Marina Smyth or Michael Osborne, caused the injuries while the other was aware and failed to protect him. Bailey was just three weeks old when the young couple found him stiff, cold and not breathing in his Moses basket next to their bed at their flat in Tonbridge, Kent, on December 5, 2016.  Despite desperate resuscitation attempts by both Osborne and paramedics, Bailey could not be revived. But a court heard that although cause of death was later recorded as a result of pneumonia, sepsis and a cold-like virus, other injuries were discovered by doctors which caused concern. These included a 5cm long bruise to the right-hand side of his head, bruising and swelling to his penis, and bruising across the middle joints of three of his fingers. Bailey also had bruises to his thumb, left elbow, left ankle and right heel, and \u0027quite intense\u0027 bleeding under his scalp. Prosecutor Jennifer Knight told Maidstone Crown Court in Kent on Monday: The head injuries found are consistent with more than one blunt impact of mild to moderate force. Any bruising to a young baby who is not yet mobile, without explanation is a cause of concern, particularly bruising to the penis which raises the possibility of pinching or impact.  Bailey\u0027s \u0027severe\u0027 fractured left tibia was discovered during a CT scan and resulted from \u0027forcible traction\u0027 most likely occurring 24 to 48 hours before he died, added Miss Knight. The kind of fracture caused by pulling with a twisting motion, a twist or yanking, injury...a very distinctive kind of fracture typically seen in non-accidental injury, she explained. Both the bruising and fracturing indicated a level of trauma beyond rough handling of Bailey and in-keeping with physical assault of Bailey in the period leading up to death. Smyth, 21, of Oxford Gardens, Maidstone, and Osborne, 22, of Bybrook Road, Kennington, Ashford, Kent, deny causing or allowing serious physical harm to a child between November 16 and December 6, 2016. The jury of seven women and five men was told the prosecution does not have to prove which parent inflicted the injuries. But Miss Knight said whichever defendant was not responsible would have still been aware of the significant risk posed to their child. It is the Crown\u0027s case that one of these two defendants was responsible for Bailey\u0027s injuries and the other, though not the actual perpetrator, allowed them to occur by failing to take responsible steps to protect Bailey from a risk of injury which should have been foreseen, she added. The court heard Osborne and Smyth met as teenagers. They lived together in Walters Farm Road and Bailey was born healthy and without complications on November 16, 2016.  He was discharged with his mum that same day and other than being diagnosed with oral thrush at two weeks\u0027 old, for which he was prescribed drops and then gel, was well. Bailey was also described as appearing \u0027well and content\u0027 at a family birthday party on December 3, just two days before he died. The court heard the couple would take it in turns to care for their son during the night and he had last been fed by Smyth at 12.30am on December 5. A neighbour later told police that he had heard a baby crying at about 1am. Jacob Nash said he went to his balcony window to listen and could hear a high-pitched cry that he thought was unusual and lasted quite a long time, maybe 20 to 25 minutes, said Miss Knight. But Smyth told police she had not heard any crying and it was not until she woke at 10am that she discovered her son was unresponsive. Having handed him to Osborne, she then telephoned her mum, crying and saying Bailey was not breathing. But it was another 45 minutes before Smyth dialled 999, the court heard. When an emergency first responder arrived just four minutes later he noticed Bailey was unconscious, grey in colour, with a stiff chest and jaw, and arms and legs which were cool to the touch. Osborne was giving him CPR under the instruction of the ambulance control centre operator. Paramedics took over but the court was told by 11am it was decided the newborn had been dead \u0027for some time\u0027 and any further attempts to resuscitate him would be futile. However, having been taken to Pembury Hospital, doctors immediately noticed bruising to his head and penis, the court heard.  His further injuries were then discovered during a post-mortem examination. Smyth and Osborne were arrested and twice interviewed by police. Both denied either being responsible for, or aware of, their son\u0027s injuries. Marina Smyth had no explanation for them. She could think of no occasion where she or Michael Osborne had ever handled Bailey in a way that might have caused his leg injury, said Miss Knight. She said he always cried when he was undressed or had his nappy changed but she had not noticed any crying that was unusual. Marina Smyth said she did not remember seeing any bruising to Bailey\u0027s penis and could not think of any reason why he would have bruising to his fingers, the head or the impacts to the top of his head. Smyth said she had fed and put her baby to sleep in his Moses basket, and did not notice any crying during the night. She then found Bailey unresponsive the next morning, gave him to Osborne and dialled 999. Asked about her relationship with Osborne, Smyth told police he would get \u0027stressed out\u0027 and described a couple of occasions when he woke her during the night because he was agitated and struggling to get their son back to sleep.

However, a once in a lifetime charity trip to Tenerife in May this year left Katie so excited and carefree she was soon chatting and getting involved with others. Katie and her dad Fin went on the incredible holiday thanks to money raised by local Lancashire charity, Days of Sunshine.  The charity takes local children away throughout the year and believed Katie - who had never been out of the country before - would really benefit from a fun trip in the sunshine. Speaking of Katie’s incredible progress single dad Fin, 52, said: “She’s a different child, I can’t believe it. “When I say she was silent, she was completely mute for seven years. “I can’t believe how much of a difference the holiday has made. I can’t pinpoint exactly what made the difference I think it was a mixture of everything. “A new place, amazing activities and new friends that she felt comfortable with, I don’t even think she realised she’d started to interact.  “She was just too excited and loving life, it was incredible to see. “It’s quite a journey we have been on and it feels like this has been a miracle holiday.” Katie was diagnosed with selective mutism - a severe anxiety disorder - when she was just four years old leaving her unable to speak to anyone except her dad. Miraculously she is now able to speak to her teacher, albeit not in front of the class, and she is able to chat with school pals and her big sister Emma Wallace, 28. Fin, from St Annes, Lancs., believes a lot of Katie’s anxieties are down to her early childhood before he took over her full-time care when she was two.  He said: “She’s already been through so much, she\u0027s such a delicate little thing and I just want the best for her. “I can’t begin to tell you how awful it was, she would suffer in silence if I wasn’t around not telling anyone if she felt poorly or was in pain. “She didn’t show expressions either, a clown could run into the classroom and she would not flinch.” Finn was starting to feel helpless and was worried Katie would continue to suffer from her selective muteness for the rest of her life. He said: “No one knew how to help, the school did their best but all you know is what you read on the internet. “She had a speech therapist but I didn’t think that would help as her speech itself is fine, she is very articulate when she talks to me.”  Fin, who is unemployed after having a heart attack and being diagnosed with cancer in 2015, said it was distressing for Katie when he was in the hospital. He said: “I was in the hospital for two weeks and Katie had to stay with her big sister Emma while I was recovering. “I can’t even begin to imagine how scared she must have been as it was the first time we had been apart and she knew I wasn’t very well. “She must have felt so lonely not speaking to anyone for so long. “It is incredible the change in her in the last month, I am so grateful to the charity - they have changed our lives beyond words.

The 18-year-old woman was on her way to lodge the bookie\u0027s earnings in the Post Office when she was set upon by the thug. Dash-cam footage captured by a passing driver shows a man in a white hoodie snatching the money before fleeing the scene. The video was released by Hertfordshire Police on Monday as they appealed for information on the theft that took place in Hatfield, Herts. Police are also appealing for information about a second man who threatened the teenager before they made off with the shop\u0027s takings.  The motorist who filmed the ordeal comforted the victim before taking her back to the Ladbrokes. Detective Constable Andrew Greenman said: We are grateful to the member of the public who has shared their footage with us after being in the right place at the right time. We are following several lines of inquiry at this stage, one of which is appealing to the public to ask if they recognise the man pictured. I want to reassure the victim that we are doing all we can to capture those responsible.  A spokesman for Hertfordshire Police said: Officers investigating a robbery in Hatfield have released dash cam footage of the offence in progress, as well as still images, in order to identify the two suspects. It happened in Wellfield Road, Hatfield, at 2.10pm on June 25. The victim, an 18-year-old woman, works at Ladbrokes in Birchwood and had left the branch with a large quantity of the store\u0027s cash takings in a bag, with the intention of banking it at a Post Office in the town centre.

On Monday evening (July 2), the university\u0027s Twitter posted a statement regarding negative feedback for their new refugee scholarship scheme. And people can\u0027t deal with their response. Instead of shaking it off like Taylor Swift would, the university clapped back at haters of their plans, telling them to \u0027jog on\u0027.  They wrote: We\u0027ve had feedback over the last week that some people are unhappy with our plan to offer up to 14 scholarships to refugees living in the local area. To these people, we would like to say: Tough. Jog on. Thousands of people have liked and shared the tweet, with many taking time to praise whoever runs the account. One person said: Amazing.

Plans for the University\u0027s refugee scholarship scheme were revealed back in June. The scheme has been developed as part of a partnership with Reading Refugee Support Group and Reading University Students\u0027 Union.   According to the University\u0027s website the scheme will include:   Up to five scholarships covering tuition fees for pre-sessional English 11-week programmes. Up to two each for Foundation, Undergraduate and Post-Graduate taught study that make up the difference between the already available financial support through Student Finance Authorities (SFA) and what the university advises students as the reasonable cost of studying in Reading. One each for Foundation, Undergraduate and Post-Graduate taught study covering the full tuition and maintenance costs for refugee students who were not eligible for funding through SFA.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have kept quiet on who they are going to name as godparents for their youngest child. But bookies are backing close confidants, like the couple\u0027s outgoing private secretaries Miguel Head and Rebecca Priestley, rather than family members. Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: It\u0027s looking increasingly likely the Duke and Duchess will turn to trusted aides over family members.  Here are the latest odds on who could be Prince Louis \u0027 godparents...   Favourite to be named as godfather is Miguel Head, Prince William\u0027s outgoing private secretary. He has been with the Royal Family for more than ten years, and took over as private secretary for the Duke in 2013.  He is due to leave his role this month, and will be replaced by Simon Case, a top civil servant in the government\u0027s Brexit department.  Tiggy Legge-Bourke - 2/1  Tiggy Legge-Bourke was William and Harry\u0027s nanny, and helped them through the death of their mother Princess Diana in 1997. She left royal service in 1999, but has remained close to the two princes. William is reportedly the godfather to her son, Tom.   Laura Lopes is the daughter of William\u0027s stepmother Camilla, from her first marriage to Andrew Parker-Bowles.  Her 10-year-old daughter Eliza was one of Kate\u0027s bridesmaids when she married William in 2011. Rebecca Priestley - 4/1  As well as William\u0027s top aide Miguel Head, Kate\u0027s former private secretary Rebecca Priestley is a favourite to be made godparent. The duchess\u0027 aide was with her since 2013, and was on hand to help Kate out during the first six years of her marriage. But she stepped down from the role last year, and is now director of a consultancy firm. David Jardine-Paterson - 5/1  David Jardine-Paterson went to Eton at the same time as Prince William, and later married one of his friends. His wife, Emilia Jardine-Paterson, is god-mother to Prince George. His younger brother, JJ Jardine-Paterson, dated Kate\u0027s sister Pippa for four years.  Hugh van Cutsem jr is the son of Prince Charles\u0027 best friend from school. The four van Cutsem brothers have been close to William and Harry since childhood. Hugh\u0027s 11-year-old daughter Grace van Cutsem is Prince William\u0027s god-daughter, and was a bridesmaid at the Duke and Duchess\u0027 wedding. She became famous after being pictured with her hands over her ears when the newlyweds appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony. Other favourites  The older sisters of William\u0027s mum Princess Diana - Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McQuodale - both have odds of 6/1. Captain Mark Dyer, a close family friend often said to be a second father-figure to Prince William, has odds of 6/1. Meanwhile William\u0027s cousins Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie both have odds of 7/1. Who didn\u0027t make the top of the list   Prince Harry\u0027s new wife Meghan Markle is way down the list of favourites, at 14/1.  Although the new Duchess of Sussex is close to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgem it\u0027s not seen as likely that she\u0027ll be made a godparent. This is because the royals still follow a pattern of choosing close friends and even former members of staff, and Meghan falls outside that category.  The same goes for Louis\u0027 uncle Prince Harry and his auntie Pippa Middleton , who at 10/1 are both a bit of a long-shot. Kate and Pippa\u0027s brother James Middleton is also in at 10/1.  And for those interested, Donald Trump has odds of 1000/1.   Prince George has seven godparents, including Earl Grosvenor - one of the wealthiest men in the country.   He also has fellow-royal Zara Tindall , Prince William\u0027s cousin, and Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton , William\u0027s former private secretary.   His other godparents are William and Kate\u0027s pals Oliver Baker , William van Cutsem and Emilia Jardine-Paterson , as well as a friend of Princess Diana, Julia Samuel .

Lewis Mundy and Kimberley Floyd, both 27, excitedly boarded a TUI flight to Greece and tucked their passports into the magazine pocket of their seats. But after stepping off the jet they realised they did not have the documents. They instantly tried to backtrack, but were told they couldn\u0027t re-board. Instead a member of staff conducted a search but quickly emerged to say they could not be found. The couple pleaded with airline employees to have another look and gave detailed instructions about where the passports were, but still they could not be found.  They were then refused entry the country and were sent packing on a return flight to the UK within 30 minutes. Lewis and Kimberly, both from Portsmouth, were unable to fly back out on another date and had to forfeit the \u0026pound1,400 holiday. Lewis, who owns his own groundworks company, described it as the biggest nightmare you could imagine. He said: We boarded the plane to go to Greece, it was very exciting. We sat to watch a film and chilled out on the plane to pass the time. We were supposed to be sunning it up in Greece but instead ended up at Stansted. There\u0027s no sign of our passports and we\u0027ve had no help, no compensation, nothing. We\u0027ve done everything we could but no one seems to care. It was a nightmare, the biggest you could imagine.  The couple booked their week-long holiday to the five star Atki Hotel on the island of Kos with First Choice and flew out on a TUI jet from Gatwick in June. Kimberley told how people looked at them like they were criminals as they waited. She said: I realised as soon as we got off the plane, it could only have been two minutes tops. They told us we couldn\u0027t get back on the plane and the made us wait by the door to the airport while someone went to look but they said there was nothing there.  We had people around us making sure we didn\u0027t leave. We were waiting for about 30 minutes for a flight back, we had to wait by the door. They tried to move us somewhere else but I refused. There was people watching us like we were criminals. After waiting for between 30 and 40 minutes the couple were put on the next flight back to the UK, and endured another four hour flight. Kimberley added: They didn\u0027t care, they gave us a boarding pass and chucked us on the next flight, we didn\u0027t get a choice - it was disgusting.

This summer, we should be trying to leave a heaped one in the garden as often as pssible.  It sounds bizarre - and unhelpful, given that sugar attracts ants and wasps , and we tend to not want them crawling and buzzing around too much.   But there is one creature who will really thank you for it.  Whether you think they\u0027re a nuisance or love them, the fact is we rely on bees a lot. In fact, almost a third of the food we eat is pollinated by these insects who are responsible for feeding 90 percent of the world’s population.  Remove them from the ecosystem, and we have a serious problem. Unfortunately, that\u0027s what we appear to be doing, as a combination of pesticides, urbanisation and climate change are causing bee numbers to drop dramatically. If bees were to disappear from the face of the earth, humans would have just 4 years left to live, Attenborough has said in the past.  Here\u0027s where a spoonful of sugar comes in.  This time of year bees can often look like they are dying or dead, however, they’re far from it, Attenborough said according to Country Living .  Bees can become tired and they simply don’t have enough energy to return to the hive, which can often result in being swept away.

Dive coach Eli Martinez had come to the end of his session at Tiger Beach, in the Bahamas, when Joe Wong naively turned his back on the toothy beast. As Joe retreats towards the boat, a huge tiger shark - named Hook - makes an opportunistic swoop towards him. Eli grabbed the giant by the nose and pushed her away from Joe, preventing a potentially fatal incident. He now uses footage of the encounter as a training video for divers.  The clip was originally filmed in 2014 but was recently uploaded to social media to help other divers. Eli said: “I have known Hook for 10 years. “It is unwise to turn your back to a tiger shark, because they know when divers are looking and when they are not. “They tend to approach divers closer that are not looking. “Tigers by nature are ambush predators and it is just an instinctual response for them.

I had always planned to go to the farm to see him but never got round to it so it was amazing that he came to me.“People driving past must have thought I was mad having a donkey in my garden. It was just fantastic – I couldn’t have wished for anything more for my birthday.“We also went out for dinner and visited friends to celebrate but Donkey Bond was an extra special surprise.”Scott said he knew he had to do something special to mark the occasion.“I have been with Sandra for about two and a half years and I was stuck about what to get her for her 50th birthday,” he said.“I was really struggling because she couldn’t tell me anything she wanted and I knew I needed to do something big and a bit different.“My friend’s aunt owns the farm and when we found out there was a donkey being hand-reared in their house because his mother had disowned him, we just thought it was amazing and he was so cute.“Donkey Bond – who is named in honour of James Bond actor Sean Connery – has his own Facebook page and I thought, ‘I wonder if they would bring him to surprise Sandra?’.“We both absolutely love animals anyway and had been following all his social media posts so I knew Sandra would love it.“It was also the first time that Donkey Bond had ever come out for a birthday surprise like this and he was absolutely fantastic.”Scott added: “Sandra is still speaking about it now and I think she will be for the next 10 years.“It really is something for her to remember and I am really glad she liked it.“I also got her a voucher to go up to the farm and walk the alpacas which will be fabulous.“It is even better because I wanted to do it as well so I will able to go along with her.”Nicky said: “Sandra’s reaction when she opened the door was amazing – absolutely brilliant.“Scott got in contact with me because he wanted to do something different for her birthday and he knew my aunt owns Balnuith Farm.“He is a very cute donkey – he lives in the farmhouse kitchen and is toilet-trained like a dog.“There is no chance that Sandra will forget her 50th.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39ef603b912.jpg ","title":"dundee is football crazy i want to earn my shirt says new united keeper siegrist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe mix of ambition and expectation is why Benjamin Siegrist jumped at the chance to up sticks and join Dundee United.The giant Swiss keeper wanted to quit Swiss football for a new challenge and believes the Tangerines tick all the boxes.“Obviously the expectations here are high, but I believe it is good to be part of something when expectations are high,” said the 26-year-old, who was an U/17 World Cup winner with Switzerland.“The gaffer is very ambitious and very focused on details as well. I like that about him.“When I knew I was moving, these things were very important to me and that’s why I came here.“The tradition of the club I know and I’ve heard good things about it as well. It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee lift firm acquires competitor","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s Caltech Lifts has announced the acquisition of Coupar Angus-based competitor Scotlifts Scotland for an undisclosed sum.The cash deal means the Dundee firm will maintain more than 1,000 lifts across the UK.Caltech was founded in 1978 by engineer Howard Renwick and is now run by his sons Andrew and Fraser.Scotlifts Scotland owner Scott Murray will join the management team as Caltech’s new installations manager.Scotlifts’ 50 contract clients, employee and company assets will also transfer to the Dundee firm.Caltech managing director Andrew Renwick said: “Over 15 years Scott has built Scotlifts Scotland into a highly-regarded company.”Based at Stannergate Road, Caltech Limited’s clients include the public and private sectors and cover local government, health, construction, oil/energy, renewables and property.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people job opportunities","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA local manufacturer has several positions available.Due to the steadily increasing demand for its products, the firm is looking to recruit city and guilds qualified bench joiners and wood machinists/CNC operators.Applicants who can demonstrate relevant experience of working in a joinery workshop environment may also be considered.The firm is also also seeking to appoint an experienced project coordinator to take responsibility for the preparation of the documentation necessary to enable manufacture to take place.

They are Lewis Toshney, William Edjenguele, Stewart Murdoch, Fraser Fyvie, Deniz Mehmet, Billy King, Paul McMullan, Tam Scobbie, James Keatings and Sam Stanton. How many of them play a meaningful role in the push for promotion this coming season, however, is certainly up for debate.In the past two campaigns under McKinnon and Laszlo, United haven’t been a million miles away from getting themselves up through the play-offs.Add in a bit of continuity through their playing squad and around it surely can only help the club get back to where they feel they belong.A list of those 86 transfers, who have arrived, departed or done both: Harry Souttar, Darko Bodul, Eiji Kawashima, Chris Erskine, Michal Szromnik, Callum Morris, John Rankin, Paul Paton, Florent Sinama-Pongolle, Henri Anier, Edward Ofere, Guy Demel, Ryan Dow, Gavin Gunning, Toshney, Frank van der Struijk, Nick van der Velden, Willo Flood, Cammy Bell, Edjenguele, Murdoch, Tope Obadeyi, Alex Nicholls, Tony Andreu, Thomas Mikkelsen, Cammy Smith, Wato Kuate, Paul Dixon, Coll Donaldson, Simon Murray, Sean Dillon, Charlie Telfer, Luis Zwick, Blair Spittal, Brad Smith, Ali Coote, Grant Gillespie, Fyvie, Emil Lyng, Patrick N’Koyi, Paul Quinn, King, Scobbie, McMullan, Keatings, Craig Slater, Scott McDonald, Jordie Briels, Harry Lewis, Stanton, Brandon Mason, Anthony Ralston, Bilel Mohsni, Clark, Booth, Wardrop, Aird, Curran, Frans, Siegrist, Rakovan and Rabitsch.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39ef8cb8f78-848x564.jpg ","title":"locals slam a complete lack of planning as asbestos sees community centre demolition costs soar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe price of demolishing the Damacre Centre in Brechin has rocketed after more asbestos was found in the building.The centre closed in early 2016 following the opening of the £26 million community campus, despite a petition from 20 groups to keep it open.Work started on clearing the site at the start of March and was due to be completed by the end of July.Councillors were told last month the cost was £172,293.However, Angus Council said “additional asbestos” has been found resulting in extra costs of £82,000 and bringing the total cost to more than £250,000.The schedule for the work has also slipped and it is now due to be completed in late August or early September.Andy Wilson, a member of the Damacre Centre residents’ committee, said: “This is the latest stage of what’s been a shoddy process all the way.“Damacre was built in the 1800s so there’s no surprise there’s a lot of asbestos in the building.”Fellow committee member Jill Scott also hit out saying: “This shows a complete lack of planning, all of which costs the taxpayer money.“I’m at a loss to see how this additional asbestos was not known about and wonder if demolition would have been agreed if the true costs were known.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39f01324c04-e1530527591774-817x564.jpg ","title":"new boy elton looks to rocket dundee up the premiership table and says the skys the limit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew boy Elton Ngwatala insists the sky’s the limit for Dundee as they look to make an assault on the Premiership top-half next season.The French midfielder, signed from Kidderminster Harriers earlier in the summer, made his second appearance in dark blue in last night\u0026#8217s 1-0 win at Cowdenbeath.This followed his debut on Friday night in a 1-1 friendly draw with Brechin City at Glebe Park.Fellow summer arrival, Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy, got the visitors’ only goal just before the hour-mark as Kharl Madianga, Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph and trialist Brian Nana-Sinkam also got their first run-outs for Dundee.And 25-year-old Ngwatala believes there is no stopping him and his new team-mates from scaling the heights in the top flight next term – with a top-six finish a known aim of manager Neil McCann.“Friday night was my first game and it felt good to play with the new lads,” he said.“They are all new team-mates for me but, with 45 minutes in the tank, now I can improve.“Hopefully, within the next couple of weeks it will be perfect.“I think there is no limit next season. We have to take each game one by one and do the best we can to get the win.”Ngwatala admits the appeal to take his game to the next level was a huge factor in his move north of the border after playing in England’s sixth tier for the past three campaigns.As well as playing in front of terrific atmospheres at Dens Park, he is looking forward to testing himself on live television and under the spotlight of big crowds at Parkhead and Ibrox.He went on: “Dundee play in the Premiership so, for me, it was a big step up from playing in the Conference North in England.“It was important for me to move to Scotland and it feels like the right time to make this step.“I want to play at the highest level and going up against Celtic and Rangers is a big deal.“I have to test myself at the highest level.”Ngwatala also heaped praise on boss Neil and the rest of the staff at the club for welcoming him to the fold.The midfield man feels he has settled into the club with ease, though when asked if he has picked up on the local lingo yet, he said: “No, nothing yet!“The training has been nice to be fair, everybody has made me feel very welcome to the club, so it’s good,” he added.“The sessions have been good with the manager.”The Frenchman’s focus now is to show supporters more of what they can expect from him in the new campaign.He added: “I like to get on the ball, create things, make things happen.“Connecting and playing with my team-mates in short spaces is important but sometimes I do like a long shot!”Ngwatala’s new gaffer Neil was delighted his new boys got some valuable minutes under their belts despite drawing in Angus, saying: “I’m not really looking too much into the performances.“It was more just fitness and we had a number of new faces who joined us for the first time on Friday and it’s going to take a wee bit of time to get that understanding.“Overall, I was quite happy with the two 45 minutes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32068acec06-839x564.jpg ","title":"new boy mendy almost signed by dundee in january","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has revealed he was close to signing new Dundee arrival Jean Alassane Mendy back in January.He held talks with the Senegalese striker back then but was pipped for his signature by Belgians Lokeren.Things did not work out for Mendy there and now Neil is delighted to have been able to get a player he believes can score regularly in the top flight.He said: \u0026#8220We tried to get him in January and I think we missed out by just a couple of hours.

Glasgow,More than 100 people attended the official opening of the new low-impact buildings and other events at the project\u0027s base in Glen Strathfarrar over two days.One bothy has been dedicated to Strathfarrar-born Pipe Major Willie Ross who lived in the house now used as staff accommodation at the Shieling.It was opened by piper Brighde Chaimbeul.Others have been named after ecologist Frank Fraser-Darling, writer Iain R Thomson, singer Margaret Bennett, poet M\u0026agraveiri Mh\u0026ograver nan \u0026Ograveran and Colin MacLeod, the founder of the GalGael Trust based in Govan.Managing

cattle \u0026ndash as a way to explore contemporary issues of sustainability and local culture.\"The new low-impact buildings, which are similar to the highly popular Nordic summer huts, will provide comfortable accommodation for schools, but also allow the ongoing development of summer camps for young people, families and adults,\" he said.The six-bed bothies were co-designed with local schools including Teanassie Primary and produced by Ullapool company Northwoods Construction.\"These new buildings will be a real inspiration to our visitors,\" Mr Harrison said.\"The bothies connect the past

changes to a funding formula which he claims leaves busy urban routes at a serious disadvantage.Milton Crescent in Hilton is to be completely resurfaced at a cost of \u0026pound100,000 and the work is due to start on Monday.Other roads across the city \u0026ndash including Midmills Road in the Crown area and Caledonian Road and Montague Row in Dalneigh are also set to have their potholes filled in.But Ness-side councillor Ron MacWilliam has called for a rethink on the way damaged roads are prioritised.At present, funds are allocated according to a formula which gives more weighting to length of road than traffic volumes.As a result, Mr MacWilliam said roads in Inverness were having less money spent on them than rural roads in the far north of Sutherland. He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate. The roads office has a fantastic team but they are fighting a losing battle.\"With regards to the funding formula, Mr MacWilliam said he was continuing to press the matter but he faced strong opposition from the much larger number of Highland councillors who represent rural wards.However, residents in Milton Crescent are just happy that work there is finally going ahead.Edward Dyce (76) relies on his vehicle to get around and said: \"I have had a lot of problems with my car because of the road surface. It\u0027 getting worse because of the amount of traffic.\"A lot of people use the road and the potholes have become a real problem.

isolated.The NSPCC’s Childline in Aberdeen has carried out 202 counselling sessions with children experiencing feelings of loneliness – and the number is up from 164 the previous year.The organisation has stated that mental health issues, bullying and social media are all contributing factors in a growing number of young people struggling with feelings of isolation.The latest figures reveal the NSPCC-supported service delivered 4,636 counselling sessions to UK children for loneliness in 2017-18 – a 14% rise on the previous year.Teenagers accounted for the majority, but the youngest person was aged just 10.Leanne Ferries, Aberdeen Childline service manager, said: “These Childline figures show that although we might not think of loneliness as something that affects young people, children are increasingly seeking support from our counsellors about feeling alone and isolated.”Figures also showed almost 80% of calls were from girls, who said the use of social media and comparing themselves to others online made them feel “increasingly isolated”.The news comes after the NSPCC’s Are You There campaign called on the UK Government to fund Childline so it can help more children and teenagers struggling with mental health issues.Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen said: “Loneliness needs to be taken seriously because it is potentially damaging to children’s physical and mental health.“The crucial question is what is causing this rise among the young?“Are we all too busy to make space and time for our children?“Is it that we have lost the habit of eating together?“Or is it the illusion created by social networks that everyone else is liked, popular and enjoying a far more exciting life, so they feel lonelier than ever?“Whatever the reason it’s crucial that young people know they can always contact Childline to speak to someone who will listen and care about them.”For more information on how to volunteer visit

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland. The last time I crossed Scotland for the appeal I was swimming and running, so cycling has to be easier… right?\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who gets involved and I look forward to riding with you.\u0026#8217Mari Slavin of the STV Children’s Appeal said: \u0026#8216Mark is a fantastic ambassador for the Appeal and we are all in awe of the gigantic challenge he’s about to take on, together with cyclists from across the country.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

In the Hampshire Down show ring Janet took second with her two shear senior stock ram. There were two third places \u0026#8211 for an aged ewe and a ewe lamb \u0026#8211 and a sixth for a gimmer. The star of the show for Brian and Janet, however, was a home-bred ewe which took first prize in her class and was reserve female champion.Campbeltown\u0026#8217s John MacLachlan was there showing Blue Faced Leicester sheep for J\u0026ampM Turner, Killdalloig with the help of Gavin Semple and Scott Thomason.He came home with a first place and reserve male champion rosette for his tup lamb, sired by Mossvale Masterplan (AI) from a mother out of a Hazelwood ewe.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s the first time out for this lamb, said John, and this is the first time I\u0026#8217ve won with a male at the Highland Show, it\u0026#8217s normally females we do well with.\u0026#8217Kildalloig also secured sixth places for their tup and ewe lamb and fourth for a shearling tup.In the coloured Bluefaced Leicester ring, Lochgoilhead\u0026#8217s Andrew Campbell came second with a tup lamb and sixth with his ewe. Andrew also secured a fourth prize in the Scotch Mules with his ewe.From Heylipol on Tiree, Alasdair MacLean did well in the Beltex section, taking home to the island second prizes for his shearling tup, shearling ewe and ewe lamb.Among the cattle lines, R\u0026ampP McAlister from Bute were handed a third place rosette with Langalbuinoch Kojack in the beef shorthorn class for bulls born in 2016.The Highland cattle classes have been an area where Argyll breeders have historically done well at the show. This year Queenie Strickland\u0026#8217s Cladich fold from the banks of Loch Awe \u0026#8211 brought out by farm manager Stuart Campbell \u0026#8211  took home a second prize with one-year-old heifer Princess Mairi 4th of Cladich. There was also a third for Capleadh Buidhe Beg 4th of Cladich in the four-year-old cow section and a fourth for one-year-old bull Monadh Mor of Cladich.A native of Kilfinan, Catherine McKechnie farms with husband Jim at France Farm, Gartocharn. Their three-year-old heifer Kirsty 2 of Gartocharn, by Brogach 1 of Balmoral and out of Kirsty Morag of Ubhaidh, won her class and also secured the reserve overall female title. The McKechnies also took home a second for a home-bred cow and her February-born calf.Catherine said afterwards: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s satisfying when you come to the show with two beasts and they go home with red and blue tickets \u0026#8211 and a reserve female champion \u0026#8211 so we can\u0026#8217t ask for much more.\u0026#8217The majestic heavy horse classes are a sight to behold, and there was a prize for a Clydesdale which has won both Kintyre and Mid Argyll shows in recent years. Garcal-Fra Sweet Chloe, from Campbeltown breeder Callum MacPhail, took third place in the class for mares with foal at foot, but Callum also took first prize in the foal class.In the four-year-old mare section there was a fourth for John \u0026#8216Speedie\u0026#8217 McMillan and family from Bute with Mill Miss Keriin , and a sixth place for McFadyen Contractors, Campbeltown.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jedburghs-jethart-callants-festival-2018-schedule-of-events","story":"JEDBURGH is getting ready to host their annual Jethart Callants Festival.\nA whole host of events, ranging from Rideouts, to a talent show and fancy dress, will kick off on Sunday, June 24 and run until Sunday, July 15.\nAnd known as one of the most anticipated days on the Jedburgh calendar, this year\u0027s Festival day (also known as Festival Friday) will take place on Friday, July 13.\nThe Festival Friday Rideout will leave Back Bondgate at 8.30am, before arriving at Ferniehirst Castle for a quick stop at around 10am.\nThe riders will then set off at 10.35am and will arrive at the town\u0027s War Memorial at 12.30pm.\nFollowing the event will be a fun day on Murray\u0027s Green, plus fancy dress later in the afternoon before the Callant\u0027s Ball rounds off the day at 10pm.\nLeading this year\u0027s festivities is 21-year-old Nicholas Arnold.\nNick, the 72nd Jethart Callant, was declared by Provost Harvey Oliver to a large crowd outside the Town Hall during the annual announcement night on Friday, May 11.\nHe received a resounding cheer from the townsfolk when he appeared out on the Hustings.\nFor more details, go to: www.jethartcallantsfestival\nSchedule of events\nSunday, June 24\n- 11.45am: Morebattle Rideout\nSaturday, June 30\n- 12pm: Southdean Rideout\n?Sunday, July 1\n- ?12.45pm: Teddy Bears Picnic and Children\u0027s Sports\nTuesday, July 3\n- 7pm: Jethart\u0027s Got Talent -

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716330121,16330013,16329951,16329068,16329035\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity.

Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.  Mr Paul, who is chairman of Glasclune Residents Association, said: \u0026ldquoWe feel that it is the wrong site for this.  \u0026ldquoWe are open to the accusation that it\u0026rsquos because it is at the back of our house and that\u0026rsquos partly fair \u0026ndash ideally we\u0026rsquod like to see the shelter pulled down.  \u0026ldquoBut rather than just saying it\u0026rsquos not right, we\u0026rsquove offered to the youth project to fundraise for an alternative.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of people who live here who have experience of managing projects.

Lauren Cowie, project manager at North Berwick Youth Project, insisted plans were \u0026ldquostill at a very early stage.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to working with the entire community and in particular those who live near the proposed shelter.

Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well.

Managing Director Jason Pullen said: \u0026ldquoShopping has evolved to become a major leisure activity. We are creating the next generation of outlet destination by delivering a balanced combination of exciting leisure and entertainment with a strong retail offering.  \u0026ldquoOur Lifestyle Outlets are 4th generation outlets and far removed from soulless factory outlets.

It comes as Gordon Brown warned the NHS would be \u0026ldquoin trauma within a decade if Scotland became independent.  The former prime minister said the NHS would be a \u0026ldquodiminished service after separation, and repeated his claims that the SNP\u0026rsquos latest independence blueprint would lead to austerity.  Statistics reveal GPs charged as much as \u0026pound1,400 per day for cover in Orkney in 2016/17, the latest year for which figures are available, while in NHS Lanarkshire charges were as high as \u0026pound1,132 per day.  Average daily rates for locum GPs varied across Scotland, from just \u0026pound90 in Dumfries and Galloway to \u0026pound851.52 in Lanarkshire. Five health boards \u0026ndash including Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Lothians \u0026ndash failed to provide information.  Earlier this year, it emerged NHS spending on agency workers had reached more than \u0026pound300 million for the first time ever.  Scottish Labour, which obtained the latest figures through Freedom of Information laws, insisted it was \u0026ldquoutterly shocking that the SNP GP crisis has created a situation where locum costs are over a thousand pounds a day.  Shadow health secretary Anas Sarwar said: \u0026ldquoThe reality is the SNP has underfunded primary care for over a decade and as a result family doctors are left over stretched, overworked and under too much pressure.  But a spokesman for new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman accused Labour of talking down the NHS instead of celebrating its achievements as it turns 70.  He said: \u0026ldquoInvestment in our health service is currently at a record high, and we aim to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over ten years to ensure a sustainable service that meets increasing demand.  Writing in The Scotsman, Mr Brown argued Scotland\u0026rsquos health service is currently \"under-staffed, under-equipped and under-financed\", despite Theresa May recently announcing a \u0026pound20 billion funding boost, translating to an extra \u0026pound2bn north of the Border.  He wrote: \"The NHS at 80 years old would, sadly, be in trauma if independence should ever happen.  \"What has become clear from the SNP\u0027s Growth Commission blueprint \u0026ndash what Nicola Sturgeon calls the foundation for independence \u0026ndash is that public spending would rise less than under Tory austerity and that even then, any new money there is would be eaten up by massive interest rate payments on what would be almost \u0026pound100 billion of new Scottish debt.\"  Mr Brown previously warned austerity will be \u0026ldquohere until doomsday under the SNP and its proposals for independence."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8011733.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-school-of-art-cranes-move-in-and-workers-ready-to-remove-the-mack-piece-by-piece","story":"  But preparations have been finalised to start dismantling the world-renowned Charles Rennie Mackintosh designed Glasgow School of Art (GSA).  Structural engineers David Narro Associates and the contractor, Reigart, have prepared plans for the work that will need to be undertaken on the Mackintosh Building.  Plans have been shared with Glasgow City Council Building Control and Historic Environment Scotland.  Bosses for the GSA said work had been carried out over the weekend to assess the condition of the Mackintosh building, with further drone footage collected.    Final preparation work for the dismantling of the elements of the building that have been deemed dangerous begin today. The main crane has been relocated to the corner of Sauchiehall Street and Dalhousie Street, and a second crane is expected to join it tomorrow.  The work to begin dismantling the south fa\u0026ccedilade will start as soon as possible following approval of the methodology by Glasgow City Council Building Control. Work is needed following a devastating fire that ripped through the building \u0026ndash known as the Mack \u0026ndash on June 15.  For more than a century this majestic building which sits on a hill above Sauchiehall Street has been the beating heart of Glasgow\u0026rsquos cultural life.  It survived two world wars and one almost catastrophic fire four years ago.  Now, large sections of the Mackintosh building will be \u0026ldquodismantled starting today following a second inferno two weeks ago, with fears it will never be rebuilt with the bill estimated to be as high as \u0026pound200 million.  No-one could have predicted the turn of events which led to the almost-renovated building being destroyed in a fire, with new pictures yesterday revealing the full extent of the damage.  It was late on a Friday night when the fire was spotted by a passing policeman. Within an hour, it had spread like wildfire with the flames carrying over to the adjacent O2 ABC where the roof soon caved in Today, there is both physical and mental turmoil.  People have been unable to return to their homes in the area around Garnethill and Sauchiehall Street since the devastating blaze. Businesses have been locked out, with owners and staff facing penury.  But council bosses have condemned people who breach the GSA cordon as \u0026ldquodeeply stupid.    The words come as locals claim to still be seeing people climbing the fence \u0026ndash despite warnings the Mackintosh building is at risk of imminent collapse. A member of Gartnethill Community Council told how one man brazenly walked up to the fence mid-afternoon and tried to pull it down.  Other locals said they saw men climb the fence in the early hours of both Saturday and Sunday.  Ian Khan, of the community council, said he had to chase away a man who tried to enter the cordon on Sunday at around 4pm. He said: \u0026ldquoWe had a meeting on Sunday afternoon and then walked around to the front of the Mackintosh building to take a look. There was a man walking up Renfrew Street with headphones in. He walked right up and started trying to pull away the fence.  \u0026ldquoI said to him, \u0026lsquoWhat are you doing?\u0026rsquo and he said, \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom just going in.\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquoWe told him he couldn\u0026rsquot do that but he ignored us and went in anyway.  \u0026ldquoThe cordon around the art school is not good enough.  The blaze ravaged the Mackintosh building on June 15, as well as spreading to the O2 ABC venue and Campus nightclub.  There have previously been arrests after individuals tried to breach the safety cordon put up in the wake of the fire.  Art school bosses have said the site is extremely dangerous with brick work at risk of collapse.  A council spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe exclusion zone exists for one reason \u0026ndash to protect life and limb. Anyone entering the area, other than a trained and accredited expert, is not only putting their life at risk but also deeply stupid.  Meanwhile, council leader Susan Aitken has said it is likely to be weeks, rather than months, before residents evacuated from their homes by the fire can return.  She said council bosses are in contact with the Association of British Insurers to smooth out issues for the now homeless residents.  This week there will be a clinic hosted by legal firm Harper Macleod to provide information to businesses on certain insurance and legal issues."},{"url":null,"title":"we-invested-our-life-savings-in-top-end-housing-scheme-and-lost-everything","story":"  The two 70-somethings are visiting the new-build housing scheme in Cleland, North Lanarkshire, for the first time, chatting in the sunshine as they wander past five-bedroom detached homes behind freshly laid lawns and drives full of spotless BMWs.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom really impressed, Ms Tatters tells Ms Wilkinson. \u0026ldquoThis is really top-end. Ms Wilkinson agrees: \u0026ldquoIt is just as I imagined it would be.  Ms Tatters, 71, is a businesswoman from Elgin. Ms Wilkinson, 74, is an actor from Sussex. The pair are among more than two dozen small investors who put up some \u0026pound1.2 million to get the Bellside Brae scheme off the ground. Their money has gone. They want to know where. So do politicians.  Ms Tatters and Ms Wilkinson and their fellow Bellside Brae investors were among hundreds of people to put money through a UK business called Cavendish Moore.  Now closed, this firm hit the headlines back in 2011 after Britain\u0026rsquos financial services watchdog launched a probe into its conduct. Cavendish Moore had placed adverts in the press offering returns of \u0026ldquoup to 50 per cent in two years in land and property investments. \u0026ldquoCan you afford to miss out? its publicity asked.  Cavendish Moore insisted it was different to so-called land bank scams \u0026ndash schemes where investors, often elderly, are enticed to invest in plots which had still to get planning permission. Instead the firm said it specialised in finding investors for land that was ready to be developed. And it grouped together investors into limited liability partnerships or LLPs to carry out individual projects.  The old Financial Services Authority (FSA) thought this amounted to an unlawful collective investment scheme. Its successor body, the Financial Conduct Authority by 2014 did a deal under which Cavendish Moore had to pay some of its investors back just 10 per cent of their money. Some of those who did get cash were already dead.  The firm is now being wound up. Its liquidator, Paul Allen of FRP Advisory, late last month said he had discovered a number of large transactions carried out by Cavendish Moore before it was shut down. In a formal report filed at Companies House, he said: \u0026ldquoI have thus far been unable to establish the ultimate beneficiaries and/or the rationale for a number of such transactions..  The investors in Bellside Brae were just one group of many who formed an LLP called Cicada under the guidance of Cavendish Moore.  After payments to Cavendish Moore, this firm representing 27 investors in 2009 put \u0026pound700,000 into a joint venture with a developer called Clydebrae Developments to put up the homes now called Bellside Brae.  Matt Blair, a retired Scottish engineer who now lives in England, was as impressed as Ms Tatters and Ms Wilkinson with the new homes.  He said:It is slightly better than I expected. The finish is fabulous. They have done a great job. But we have been excluded from benefiting from this project. I think it is inconceivable that you can build quality homes on a site like this and that your money could disappear.  \u0026ldquoWhen you make an investment you know there is risk. You might not get all of your money back, but to lose all of it?  The problem for Mr Blair and his fellow investors is that Clydebrae Developments went under before the project was finished. The business was struck off in 2015. It had no assets. Clydebrae was owned by another 70-something man, Robert Kirk of Helensburgh. The land it was developing, it turned out, did not belong to Clydebrae, it was held by a business registered in the British Virgin Islands called Crannoch Investments, in trust, according to lawyers for Cicada, for Mr Kirk.  The Herald asked Mr Kirk if he could explain what had happened to the investors\u0026rsquo money. Speaking at his sandstone home in the leafy west end of Helensburgh, Mr Kirk said he could not say.

He said money from the joint venture had gone to complete groundwork at the site.  Bellside Brae, he added, was \u0026ldquounsuccessful for a number of reasons, predominately market related. Clydebrae was forced to sell its right to develop the land by its secured creditors, he explained.  Rights were bought by another business called Calder Developments. One of its former directors, Mark Thompson, had also served as a director of Clydebrae. The Herald was unable to reach either Calder or Mr Thompson for comment.

Genetically engineered mice given the drug had reduced levels of a key hallmark of Alzheimer\u0026rsquos in their brains, sticky clumps of beta amyloid peptide.  Impaired clearance of the protein building block from the brain is thought to be one of the main causes of the disease.  A US team led by Professor Kalipada Pahan, from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, found low-dose aspirin stimulated the formation of lysosomes \u0026ndash\u0026nbsptiny sacs in cells filled with digestive enzymes that help break down and clear away unwanted or harmful material.  The scientists wrote in the journal JNeurosci: \u0026ldquoStimulation of lysosomal biogenesis and reduction of amyloid plaque\u0026nbsppathology by low-dose aspirin holds promising therapeutic potential for treatment of AD (Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease).  However British experts urged caution.\u0026nbsp  Professor Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoWhile this work is scientifically interesting, it is at very early stages.  \u0026ldquoThe amyloid reducing effects of aspirin were shown in cells in a dish and in a single mouse model of Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease with relatively few mice per group.  \u0026ldquoFurther, the study did not show whether aspirin helped the brain function in this disease model.\u0026nbspMore work will need to be done in order to know whether low-dose aspirin could help prevent or treat Alzheimer\u0026rsquos.  Rob Howard, Professor of Old Age Psychiatry at University College London, added: \u0026ldquoClinical trials of aspirin have already been performed in patients with Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease.  \u0026ldquoThe drug had no beneficial effects on outcome measures and was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.  The American researchers pointed out\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspmechanism appeared to be dependent on a protein called PPAR-alpha, levels of which fell significantly with age.  This might explain why trials looking at the effects of aspirin on elderly Alzheimer\u0026rsquos patients had produced disappointing results, they said.  Dr Sara Imarisio, from Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK, said: \u0026ldquoAspirin is a commonly taken medicine for a number of health conditions, but there has been little research to examine potential benefits for Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease.  \u0026ldquoThis early-stage research suggests aspirin may help improve how the brain removes amyloid, a protein known to build up in Alzheimer\u0026rsquos. The study reveals important insights into the mechanisms through which aspirin may impact brain health, however this is a small study in mice so it\u0026rsquos too early to draw conclusions about whether aspirin could be used to treat Alzheimer\u0026rsquos in people."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-formally-welcomed-to-edinburgh-at-start-of-holyrood-week","story":"  The annual Ceremony of the Keys saw the monarch handed the keys of the city and welcomed by Edinburgh Lord Provost Frank Ross.

The sweltering spell has continued into July, with many parts enjoying temperatures around the mid-to-high 20s.  Tennis lovers looked set for plenty of action as Wimbledon began on Monday, with stars kicking the tournament off on sun-drenched courts.  Meanwhile, utility companies have been pumping billions of extra litres of water to try and keep pace with demand, which has risen by as much as 30%, Water UK said.  But there is no risk of drought, as above-average rainfall in the Spring means water levels are in a healthy position, it added.  There are currently no restrictions in England, but Thames Water says it is funnelling an extra 450 million litres per day as it deals with \u0026ldquorecord levels of demand and many suppliers are warning their customers to use water sparingly.  Some households in Berkshire, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire may see low-pressure hit their water supplies during peak hours, it added.  In the Republic of Ireland, a month-long hosepipe ban took effect in the greater Dublin area on Monday as demand continues to outstrip supply across the country.  The weather has been dry since late February in the country, with authorities saying rainfall has been similar to 1976, when a major drought took hold, Irish Water said.  It follows the ban introduced across Northern Ireland last Friday with the public asked to limit tap water use to drinking, cooking and washing.

The charity said that mental health issues, bullying and social media are all contributing towards a growing number of young people struggling with feelings of isolation and loneliness.  Across the UK, the NSPCC-supported service delivered 4,636 counselling sessions to children for loneliness in 2017/18 - a 14% rise on the previous year.  Teenagers accounted for most of the sessions, with the youngest person being just 10.  The NSPCC\u0027s Are you there? campaign is calling on the UK Government to provide funding to Childline so it can help more children and teenagers struggling with mental health issues.  Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen said: \"Loneliness needs to be taken seriously because it is potentially damaging to children\u0027s physical and mental health.  \"The crucial question is what is causing this rise among the young?  \"Are we all too busy to make space and time for our children? Is it that we have lost the habit of eating together?  \"Or is it the illusion created by social networks that everyone else is liked, popular and enjoying a far more exciting life, so they feel lonelier than ever?  \"Whatever the reason, it\u0027s crucial that young people know they can always contact Childline to speak to someone who will listen and care about them.\"  Two of Childline\u0027s 12 UK bases are in Scotland and both of them carried out more counselling sessions with young people experiencing loneliness in the last year.  Glasgow\u0027s Childline base answered 817 calls from children across the UK who were feeling lonely, up from 693 the previous year, while the Aberdeen base carried out 202 counselling sessions with UK children, up from 164.

Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: \u0026ldquoRegrettably, over 210,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in June because of four weekends of ATC (air traffic control) strikes and repeated UK, German and French ATC staff shortages.  \u0026ldquoRyanair calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and European governments to ameliorate the effect of ATC strikes and staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France from disrupting the travel plans of millions of Europe\u0026rsquos consumers this summer.

The whole Cabinet will be at the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos official country retreat in Buckinghamshire on Friday. The venue offers more privacy than Downing Street, where reporters and photographers can linger outside the black door to No 10. Ministers will be kept at the mansion until they have reached agreement.  \u0026ndash What do they need to decide?  The Government has to set out what it wants its future relationship with the European Union after Brexit to look like. This includes issues relating to customs and trade which have triggered furious rows within the Tory ranks.  \u0026ndash What about customs?  On customs, two models have been considered by ministers: the \u0026ldquomaximum facilitation system favoured by Brexiteers, which would use technology to help reduce friction at the border or the \u0026ldquocustoms partnership where the UK would collect duties on behalf of the EU.  Because of problems with both models, a \u0026ldquothird way may now be under consideration, although details are scant on what the compromise could be.  \u0026ndash What about the single market?  The Prime Minister has ruled out remaining in the single market, but fundamental questions need to be resolved about how far the UK will deviate from the standards set by Brussels.  Businesses fear that if domestic rules after Brexit stray too far from those set by the EU, it will hamper their ability to work and trade in those markets.  But some Brexiteers favour divergence, arguing that it will enable the UK to compete on the global stage and slash red tape. They question what the point of leaving the EU will be if the UK remains bound by rules over which it no longer has a say.  \u0026ndash Will decisions be reached?  Mrs May has so far managed to hold together the mix of Brexiteers and former Remainers in her Cabinet, but descending from the fence on one side or the other of the debate is likely to strain that fragile truce.  A further slice of Brexit fudge is a possibility, but the Prime Minister has promised the White Paper that will emerge after the talks \u0026ldquowill set out detailed proposals.  \u0026ndash Could there be resignations?  Tensions are undoubtedly running high. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson could face a difficult decision if the Cabinet comes down in favour of close alignment with EU rules and the \u0026ldquocustoms partnership model.  On the other hand, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Business Secretary Greg Clark would resist any Brexit deal which would hit jobs and the economy.  \u0026ndash What next?  A White Paper setting out the Government\u0026rsquos blueprint for Brexit will be published next week. Mrs May wants talks with Brussels to \u0026ldquointensify and accelerate once it is produced.

By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 3:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal. One is 4.6 kilometres long and the other 2.7 kilometres.They will be used by Shell to develop the potential reserves in the Penguins field.Subsea7\u0026rsquos local site manager, Willie Watt, said: \u0026ldquoWe would be looking to make a start on this project by the autumn of next year and launch in the late spring of 2020.\u0026ldquoThis is very good news for the site and for Caithness. It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back. The last bundle we did for them was in 2003.\u0026ldquoIt is an important project and shows pipeline bundles are the preference for developing the North Sea sector. It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 3:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116401.jpg","title":"Sunny conditions set to continue all week in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCAITHNESS and other parts of the north are set to enjoy more dry and settled conditions under gin-blue skies coupled with virtually unbroken sunshine for the remainder of the week and beyond.On Sunday afternoon the air temperature in Wick peaked at 21.6C (70.9F).\u0026nbspLast Thursday morning the town witnessed a high of 22.5C (72.5F), making it the warmest day in the burgh for any day in June since 2011.The highest temperature recorded in Wick since 1910 is currently 26.7C (80.1F), witnessed on June 6, 1939.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

The crew also carried out maintenance work on lights and lanterns.As time went by the vessel was employed in the conversion of automated lighthouses to solar panel operation. When this work was completed in 1996, the ship was taken out of service.An initiative was later launched to preserve the vessel as a floating cultural monument.This ship is representative of a type of specialised vessel from a unique period in the history of Norwegian lighthouses and is open to the public today, Wednesday, afternoon 2pm-6pm, the again from 10am-Noon and 2pm \u0026#8211 6pm on Thursday.More details about the visit of the ship in The Orcadian next week.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long.

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to. Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not! I\u0026rsquove lived a normal sort of life and I\u0026rsquove been lucky, particularly with my health.\"In recent years she has taken up using an iPad, can send emails and enjoys playing Candy Crush.Exhibition and sale days at The Muir Hub, which is on Great North Road, will be staged until\u0026nbspThursday between 9.30am and 4pm.Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 3:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The new investment is a vote of confidence in a thriving local community and will create and sustain local jobs for some years forward.\"The new homes will range from two-bedroom semi-detached through to four-bedroom detached homes.Tulloch will also stage an open day next Saturday for its Chanonry Park scheme in Fortrose where homes have a price tag of between \u0026pound225,000 for a three-bedroom detached villa and \u0026pound268,000 for a four-bedroom detached home with garage.She described Chanonry Park as \"an excellent development for us\" and expects the Fortrose scheme to sell out this summer.She said: \"This will bring to an end eight years of Tulloch Homes involvement with Fortrose, during which it has assisted in local population growth.\"The developer said it was looking for prospective development sites on the Black Isle as the area has witnessed a steady demand for housing in recent years.Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 3:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 3:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A number of new schools have been built, which is brilliant for the pupils and communities that benefit.\"Despite receiving more funding than nearly all other local authorities, Highland Council still has the worst school estate in Scotland.\"The funding recognises the rurality of Highland Council, but most schools have been built in more densely populated areas like Inverness. It is of particular sadness that this funding has not gone further so that more school buildings could benefit.\"But Highland Council leader Margaret Davidson has defended the local authority\u0026rsquos track record, pointing out that it has 204 schools to maintain \u0026ndash more than any other area in the country. She added that Scottish Schools for the Future funding was welcome but added that current levels of funding from Holyrood are \"simply not enough to adequately invest in our schools\".She urged the Scottish Government to provide funding levels which recognise the unique challenges facing the Highlands, \"and in particular the very large number of schools, many of which are smaller schools, requiring urgent investment\".And she called for it to consider capacity pressures when allocating funding.\"If Kate Forbes wants to help Highland schools, then she should support our asks from government.\"Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 3:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762978.1530605465!/image/image.jpg","title":"darren mcgarvey i m struggling to cope with success","story":"\t\tAbscesses, insomnia and migraines - Orwell Prize winner Darren McGarvey writes candidly about his mental and emotional struggle with success.\t\t\t\tIt’s 1.38 on Monday morning and, in an abandoned hotel foyer at the Holiday Inn Express in Stratford, I am about to start writing my column. I’m so tired I could cry. \u2028In the morning, we’re taking my son to Thomas The Tank Engine Land and we decided to drive down on Sunday evening to avoid the traffic.             I don’t want to have to work on what should be the first day of a family holiday, which means pulling an all-nighter, so I can file without missing quality time with my children.            This time last week, I was in another hotel in London. The week before that, Edinburgh. Or was it Salford? Or Dundee? It’s hard to say, if I’m honest. The workload has fried my brain to the point I often cannot recall the prior day’s events when asked what I’ve been up to. I feel like I am losing my mind. Every day bleeds into the next, with no respite in sight. But complaining about the fact I feel like I am on the cliff-edge of a mental health crisis seems utterly futile because, from the outside, it appears I am enjoying wonderful, unprecedented success. Success for which I ought to be grateful.Of course, I am grateful. If anything, I am in a state of permanent disbelief about what is going on. The truth is I haven’t had a minute to reflect on or even savour anything that has happened since November last year when the publication of my book began a chain of events that culminated, last Monday, in being awarded the coveted Orwell Prize.More people than ever seem to want to speak to me, for different reasons. Some just want to say, “well done” and others want to share their stories. Some want to me to come and visit their projects and others want to buy the film and TV rights to my life story.             I did some business in London last week that will make your eyes bulge out of their sockets when its announced, yet somehow, in this haze of physical and emotional exasperation, nothing feels real. I don’t even feel real.READ MORE: Scotsman columnist Darren McGarvey wins Orwell Prize for political writingPeople love a good rags-to-riches story. Hell, I know I do. But imagine how surreal it feels when you become the centre of one. You are suddenly inundated with requests, calls, offers and correspondence, without any frame of reference for what is going on. It’s incredibly disorientating and sometimes frightening, if I’m honest. But there is rarely an opportunity to express that truth, because you are always being prompted to describe how it feels to become “successful”. People want to hear a specific story. The story about a diamond in the rough, escaping poverty, surviving neglect and abuse to become an award-winning author. People are less interested in what it took to get into this position.             The fact I am struggling mentally and emotionally is even less interesting. The details about my cluster migraines, abscesses and insomnia are met with looks of confusion, as people instinctively attempt to direct me away from what I want to say and back to the “narrative”: my capitalist hero-journey. They don’t want to hear about the thousands I’ve spent on hotels, trains and flights, travelling this island by myself, with a heavy bag over my shoulder and a box of books under my arm, literally selling hand-to-hand. The hundreds of books I’ve purchased with my own money, to sign and post all over the world to plug gaping holes in my finances. They don’t want to hear about the anxiety attacks I often experience as notifications flood my devices or the fear I suffer every time I give an interview to a newspaper or broadcaster. Nobody cares that I live in constant dread that I will misspeak on a sensitive issue and become a target for people online. Nobody is interested in me describing what it feels like to come home after weeks of being on the road, to find my two-year old sitting with his back to me – his way of letting me know he isn’t pleased with my absence. I haven’t made a penny off my book yet. I am living off advances. But any time I try to express that these overwhelming mundanities – and not the successes – are what currently consume every moment of my waking life, I feel the weight of other people’s expectations bearing down on me. READ MORE: Darren McGarvey: Journalists must leave their ivory towers to gain respect            To the extent that I am learning it’s best to simply conceal the reality of my life, or risk appearing ungrateful or worse, spoiling the vicarious thrill others might experience when they enquire, “how does it feel?”I don’t know how it feels. I haven’t had a minute to take anything in. I run around like a mad-man, I fall asleep somewhere, and I wake up and do it all again. Every. Single. Day. No matter who I speak to, my constant refrain – that I am in urgent need of rest and fear I may be heading for a fall – never seems to be heard. The only thing I haven’t been offered in the last seven days is a good night’s sleep. I feel obligated to so many people, for different reasons, that my own needs fall to the bottom of the hierarchy of concern. My problems are marked as low-priority and so must remain hidden, revealed only in late-night social media outbursts when I feel trapped on Scotland’s decrepit public transportation network.All I need is a few days where I am not expected to do anything. Where I am not obligated to speak to anybody. Where I can gather my thoughts and rejuvenate after two years of non-stop, high-pressure work, couched in constant financial insecurity and stress. Anybody getting any ideas that I’m too far removed from the working class to write about it, ought to refer to my seven-day-a-week schedule for proof that I am more working class now than I ever was – with no holiday entitlement. It’s 3.10am. The kids will be up in four hours.

Two options for customs arrangements after Brexit were drawn up in full knowledge that both would be unacceptable to factions within the Conservative party and also, more importantly, the European Union.            These have now reportedly been ditched with the belated realisation that they were either practically or politically impossible to deliver.

Her watchwords during this process appear to have been delay, dither and dissemble, but unfortunately, time is now running out.As the head of the 60-strong European Research Group of hard-Brexiteer MPs, Jacob Rees-Mogg is effectively the leader of a party within a party. He has warned they will not sign up to anything short of a clean break, prompting fellow Sir Alan Duncan, a fellow Tory MP and Government minister, to criticise Rees-Mogg’s “insolence”. “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise and should pipe down,” he tweeted.

If the UK cannot decide what it wants, it will end up getting exactly what they want. Politicians of all parties need to realise the old fault lines do not apply on this issue and that, for the sake of the nation, they must form an ad hoc ‘national coalition of the sensible’ to secure a Brexit deal that will outrage the hardliners but save the economy from disaster.READ MORE: Lesley Riddoch: Doomsday report exposes Brexit vulnerability"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762976.1530605815!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis media is doing its job over brexit dark money","story":"\t\tDUP Brexit spending raises concerns about the law, not about how it was reported, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.\t\t\t\tIn the final days of the EU referendum campaign, the Democratic Unionist Party paid for a wrap-around advert in the , calling on voters to “take back control”.            The message reached far beyond Northern Ireland, where the  isn’t even distributed, and should have been far beyond their means – an advert like that costs more than a quarter of a million pounds. The DUP spent less than £100,000 on an entire devolved election campaign in 2016.            In fact, the party that now keeps the Conservatives in power spent an incredible £425,000 on Brexit, buying a lot besides newspaper advertising. How they came into that money might have remained a secret, but for intense political and media pressure.Electoral rules in Northern Ireland did not, until recently, require parties to declare where they had got their money from – a legacy of the Troubles. We might never have found out that the DUP’s Brexit campaign was bankrolled by the Constitutional Research Council (CRC), a shadowy group headed by a former Scottish Conservative Party chairman and parliamentary candidate, Richard Cook.The CRC doesn’t file accounts and has no public face. We have no idea where it gets its money – and the only person who knows, Cook, isn’t saying. Meanwhile, his own business dealings have come under intense scrutiny.READ MORE: SNP calls for investigation into ‘shady business’ of Vote Leave fundingAll of this has been reported over the past 18 months. The journalists Peter Geoghegan and Adam Ramsay, writing for Open Democracy, have been the most dogged, but they’ve been abetted by other outlets.            The latest revelations about Cook’s previous activities were the product of an investigation by BBC Northern Ireland, and were picked up and reported by BBC Scotland. Cook is an elusive character, but was doorstepped by Channel 4 News and challenged to reveal where the CRC’s money came from. When the CRC was first named by the DUP, the news was splashed on the front page of the Herald, and the story had also been reported by its sister paper, the Sunday Herald, and other publications.The DUP donation has been linked to wider claims of cooperation between different Brexit campaigns in breach of electoral spending law, stemming from the widely reported Cambridge Analytica controversy. The central allegation is that money was passed to different groups to avoid legal spending limits – a claim that has been denied, but which is under investigation by the Electoral Commission.The facts are that the DUP spent £32,000 with data firm AIQ, which also received 40 per cent of the official Vote Leave campaign budget, as well as nearly £675,000 from another campaign group, BeLeave. When the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie told MPs he was “absolutely convinced” the spending represented a breach of electoral law, that was reported in The Scotsman.All this serves as a lengthy run up to this: when Nicola Sturgeon echoed the Twitter hordes by saying she was “surprised there aren’t more media questions being asked” about what the SNP is calling ‘dark money’, I shared her surprise.            Engaging with people who question the how, why and why not of stories in the Scottish media is usually pointless – they are almost always motivated by political partisanship, a deep attachment to conspiracy theory, and a lack of understanding about how the news today works. Those traits shouldn’t be encouraged.If critics want to see what is a complicated story delved into more deeply, then they have to accept that the biggest problem with the so-called ‘mainstream’ media in Scotland is that there isn’t enough of it – that sort of work takes resources, mainly time. Many of the wounds of the media industry were self-inflicted. It doesn’t help for elected politicians to keep punching them. Above all, the details already uncovered in the story of the DUP’s Brexit cash have amply demonstrated that rules around political donations lack transparency, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. In a world were ‘calling out’ something is seen as akin to political action, the media’s critics have somehow convinced themselves the problem is that not enough is being written. Actually, it’s that not enough is being done.

Ms Gibson argued the “hostile environment” created would drive EU citizens to leave the UK.She warned of the consequences of a breakdown of trust over the SNP’s “power grab” concerns in relation to the Government’s Brexit legislation.She said: “Those who value the Union beware, beware that whenever the next referendum on Scottish independence comes - and come it will - the debate has been crystallised... like never before.“Every day this Tory Government demonstrates just a little bit more that they cannot be trusted by the people of Scotland...

Responding, Brexit minister Robin Walker said: “The Government is clear that we want a deal that works for the whole UK.”On EU citizens, he added: “I think the environment has been welcoming.”Four times as much of Scotland’s business was with the UK compared with Europe, he said, adding that the worst thing for Scottish jobs and businesses would be to split from the UK.He said: “The UK Government made substantial and reasonable modifications to provisions in the EU (Withdrawal) Act during its passage, those changes were the result of joint working that we undertook with the Scottish and Welsh Governments.”The legislation he said “does respect” the devolution settlement, adding the Government was “disappointed” the Scottish Government did not choose to give consent.Throughout the process he said the UK Government had acted in line with the Sewel Convention, adding the interests of the people of Scotland were best served when Holyrood and Westminster worked together."},{"url":null,"title":"treasury considering raising fuel duty","story":"\t\tThe Treasury is considering raising fuel duty for the first time in eight years to pay for the UK Government\u0027s pledge to add \u0026#16320bn\u0026#160to the NHS budget within five years.\t\t\t\tGovernment sources were quoted as saying that scrapping the freeze on fuel duty, which has cost the Treasury £46bn since 2011-12, was \"under serious consideration\".

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.

The skipper handled the situation extremely well.”\nThe 40-year-old converted fishing boat, with an all-female crew and female passengers, was heading to Shetland for a diving trip, and will be in the isles for the next few weeks.\n since January last year and has 22 years experience as a power boat instructor, said she called the coastguard as a precaution.\n was [originally] a fishing boat and well able for the conditions.”\nThe problem started when the boat began taking in water from the rudder gland and a deck hatch, she said. The boat was equipped with a three bilge-pump system but one of the pumps had failed, meaning they only had one as back-up. Ms Weaver said: “We try to be two failures away from a problem.” Also, she said, she had to “err on the side of caution” because the boat was carrying 12 passengers.\n was able to proceed “under her own power and pumping under her own power” into Lerwick. She is currently in the small boat harbour.\n and two sunken klondykers.\n is used for various types of dive trips, including recreational and wreck diving in locations in Orkney and Shetland, including Scapa Flow and Fair Isle as well as in northern Scotland and Faroe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
