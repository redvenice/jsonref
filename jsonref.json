The weekly total is down 10 per cent.

When millions of people in each age cohort are desperate to book jab appointments as soon as they become available online, it’s profoundly discriminatory to build a system that requires only pregnant women to jump through multiple hoops.\u0027An NHS spokeswoman said: \u0027Following the updated guidance set out by the JCVI, the NHS immediately communicated the advice to GPs.\u0027If you’re pregnant, or think you might be, speak to your maternity team or GP surgery to discuss your vaccine appointment so that it can be arranged at a site offering the PfizerBioNTech or the Moderna vaccine, which is preferable for pregnant women.\u0027It comes after the JCVI today recommended that all those under-40 should receive an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine, amid plummeting infections.Advisers made the recommendation after more adults suffered the potentially-fatal clotting disorder in the past week.They said the absolute risk of the clots is still \u0027extremely small\u0027, affecting around one in 100,000 people given the British-made jab.So far regulators have spotted major blood clots in 242 people, of whom 49 died. But they are occurring more in younger adults, with a rate of around one in 60,000 under-40s.Experts said the infection rate in the UK is now so low that the risk of the rare clots outweigh that of Covid in younger adults, who often only suffer mild illness. They will be offered the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines instead, so long as there is enough supply and it won\u0027t delay the rollout.Anyone, no matter what age, who has been given their first dose of the AstraZeneca jab and didn\u0027t suffer the complication is being urged to come forward for their second.England\u0027s deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam claimed the change would not affect the Government\u0027s target to vaccinate all adults by July 31.\u0027Our vaccine supply schedule will support the change without limiting the speed and scale of the vaccine roll-out,\u0027 he told a televised Downing Street press conference.\u0027I do expect that we are still on target to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July.\u0027It was previously recommended on April 7 that those under 30 with no underlying health conditions should be offered an alternative to AstraZeneca.        "},{"url":null,"title":"Ministers say Boris rule longer Thatcher","story":"Share this article \u0027We understand that.

Charles Michel, the Belgian president of the European Council, the body which sets Europe’s policy agenda, said the bloc was ready to discuss a US offer to suspend patent protection on vaccines – once the details are clear. “We are ready to engage on this topic, as soon as a concrete proposal would be put on the table,” Michel said, as EU leaders discussed the issue at an EU summit in Porto, Portugal. Michel, who represents the EU’s 27 national leaders, cautioned however that the bloc has doubts about the idea being a “magic bullet” in the short term, AFP reported. The quickest solution to ramp up the distribution of vaccines globally was exports, and the EU encouraged “all the partners to facilitate the export of doses”, he said.  The World Health Organization, India and South Africa have all called for patents to be temporarily suspended. But the day before at the summit, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said: “An IP waiver will not solve the problems, will not bring a single dose of vaccine in the short- and medium-term.” EU officials briefing journalists in Brussels on the issue said the hoarding of crucial ingredients needed for vaccines was a larger obstacle.  The US is not in a position to export Covid vaccine doses to countries in need because of contracts it signed with vaccine-makers preventing their use outside America, and a Defense Production Act that restricts exports until Americans are vaccinated first.  That contrasts with the EU, which has sent more than 200m doses abroad – as many as it kept for itself – prompting von der Leyen to describe the bloc as “the pharmacy of the world”.Supplies will cover booster shots, donations and reselling of doses, the agency quoted the European Commission, the EU’s executive, as saying on Friday.  Announcing the deal, Ursula von der Leyen, head of the commission, said on Twitter:  AFP, the French state-backed news agency, has the story: In the recording, made in his native Spanish, Francis backed “universal access to the vaccine and the temporary suspension of intellectual property rights” and he condemned the “virus of inidualism” that “makes us indifferent to the suffering of others”. He said: The move is fiercely opposed by major drugmakers because they say it would set a precedent that could threaten future innovations, and insist the move would not speed up production.Pope Francis’s move to join the call to open the books on how the vaccines are made puts him at odds with several European countries, including Germany and the UK. I’ll bring you more on this as it comes. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s council chairman, said:  The new restrictions, which come amid a third wave of infections and increasing nerves over the pandemic crisis in neighbouring India, are the strictest since a one-month lockdown was imposed in April last year. Eid, which comes at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, usually sees the mass movement of people around the country and tourist spots crowded with Pakistanis. Last year there was a spike in cases in the country in the weeks after the celebrations. In a tweet, Asad Umar, the planning minister, who has been leading the government response to the outbreak, said: Businesses, hotels and restaurants as well as markets and parks will be closed, while public transport between provinces and within cities has been halted. The military has been mobilised to monitor the restrictions.  Mosques, however, which have been packed each night throughout Ramadan - with few people wearing masks - will remain open. Authorities fear curbs on places of worship could ignite confrontation in the deeply conservative Islamic republic.  Pakistan has recorded more than 850,000 infections and 18,600 deaths, but with limited testing and a ramshackle healthcare sector, official figures may not cover the true extent of the impact on the country from Covid-19.An easing of international travel restrictions was announced by Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, on Friday evening, with Portugal and Israel among those placed on England’s first ever “green list”. Travellers arriving from countries on the green list will not have to quarantine upon their return to the UK, while those on the amber list must self-isolate at home for 10 days, but can be released at day five if they get a negative Covid test result. The red list country rules remain that only UK residents and nationals are allowed in – and all must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. Responding to the easing of the rules, Garry Wilson, EasyJet’s CEO, told BBC Breakfast:  The 4,187 new deaths took India’s overall toll to 238,270 since the pandemic started. It added another 401,078 new cases in 24 hours taking its caseload to nearly 21.9m. Experts, who have expressed doubts about the official death toll, say India may not hit a peak in its current surge until the end of May. Speaking on CNN to Christiane Amanpour, Farrar described the US support for waiving vaccine patents as an “historic moment”, but he said that a difference would not be made until the US and European countries distribute their huge stockpiles of vaccines beyond their own populations.  In Hanoi, the national hospital of tropical diseases, which has been the country’s Covid-19 frontline, has been sealed off after a doctor, two nurses and more than 20 patients tested positive earlier the week, the Associated Press reports.   Meanwhile, the city’s K hospital, which is designated to treat cancer patients, also closed Friday after 11 people were found to be infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus.  In a government meeting broadcast on national television on Friday, the health minister, Nguyen Thanh Long, said: Early on in the pandemic, health authorities in Vietnam were able to keep the spread of the virus contained through strict controls and, since the start of the pandemic, Vietnam has recorded just 3,137 confirmed cases and 35 deaths.  Curbs have been reimposed in areas with outbreaks. In the 19 provinces and cities with Covid-19 cases, schools have been closed and classes moved online. In Hanoi, authorities urged people to refrain from gathering while city parks and food stalls were closed. In southern Ho Chi Minh City, gatherings of more than 30 people were banned starting this weekend. The city has also closed bars, clubs, gyms and buffet restaurants.  Meanwhile, a 35-year-old nurse died of a severe allergic reaction after receiving a shot of AstraZeneca on Friday evening, the health ministry said. Scholl, who was executed by the Nazis for distributing anti-Nazi pamphlets, is an emblem of courage and a national hero in Germany. She has, perhaps inevitably, been adopted by protesters who believe they are facing a new medical dictatorship. One of her nephews, Julian Aicher, has spoken at anti lockdown demonstrations, including on a stage decorated with white roses - evoking the name of Scholl’s resistance group. On 22 February, 1943, Scholl and her older brother Hans, both members of a small resistance group called the White Rose, were beheaded in the Stadelheim prison in Bavaria following a summary trial. They had been found guilty of distributing pamphlets on the grounds of Munich University, having converted to the resistance after being members of Nazi organisations in their teens. Sophie Scholl, born on 9 May, 1921, has become the most famous face of the resistance movement, with surviving photos showing her distinctive cropped hair and determined smile. Hundreds of schools and streets now bear her name, and in 2003 she was named the nation’s fourth favourite German behind Konrad Adenauer, Martin Luther and Karl Marx. And now the resistance campaigner’s image has been hijacked by protesters against coronavirus restrictions in Germany, who have sought to compare themselves with victims of the Nazis. “I feel like Sophie Scholl, because I’ve been active in the resistance for months,” one protester told a rally against virus restrictions in Hanover in November, leading to widespread condemnation.More than 50m doses of a Covid vaccine have been distributed in the UK, 16.7m of which are second doses, according to government figures. Commenting on the success of vaccine distribution, Dix told the Daily :  Earlier this week, Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, said scientists are looking at a range of options for an autumn booster vaccination campaign to protect against a third wave of coronavirus. But Dix said he felt this could be pushed back into the new year: “We may decide that we need to boost the immune response, and we’ve got the vaccine to do that. Whether we’ll need to or not, I would think probably not, but we might still do it in case.  “I really don’t think it should be autumn. We should be thinking about boosting in maybe January or February, because the immune response will be strong.”Already this morning it looks like more bad news from India, where two southern states have become the latest in the country to announce lockdowns amid increasing numbers of infections. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu imposed lockdowns after record numbers of new coronavirus infections on Friday. India now accounts for nearly half of the world’s new known cases according to a tally by AFP, the French state-backed news agency, and it reported a national record 4,187 new deaths Saturday.

Video: Bryan O\u0027Brien This section of Capel Street would remain open to traffic under proposals. File photograph Nick BradshawThe Plans to reduce traffic and parking on Dublin’s Capel Street to facilitate outdoor dining when Covid-19 restrictions ease, have been described as unambitious and disapointing by traders, politicans and sustainable transport groups.Dublin City Council is proposing to pedestrianise a small section of the street at its northern end and to eliminate almost all on-street parking to create space for tables and chairs.Under the proposals, expected to come into force from May 24th, a 60m section of the street, which is more than 0.5km long, would be fully pedestrianised.Banning cars from this section, between Parnell Street and Ryder’s Row, would result in minimal disruption to traffic as motorists, who are permitted to drive north only at this point, would still have the option of using Ryder’s Row.All parking between Mary Street and the quays would be removed and replaced with footpath extensions to allow for outdoor dining.Between Mary Street and Little Britain Street, five general parking spaces and one disabled parking space would be retained, but the council said other disabled spaces would be relocated to streets in the “immediate vicinity” to ensure no reduction of numbers. Loading bays would also be relocated to “better align with non-hospitality businesses,” the council said.While pedestrianistation measures are already underway around Grafton Street on the southside of the city, northside hospitality businesses and councillors have complained that their areas have been neglected by the council.Capel Street business owner Panti Bliss, who runs Pantibar at the southern end of the street, criticised the lack of ambition in the plans and encouraged people to make a submission to the consultation process.“Well, the proposed ‘pedestrianisation’ of Capel St is a total disappointment. As I originally worried, it’s only the very far end of the street. And the Pantibar end? No change *at all*. Even left with the full three lanes of traffic!”Green Party councillor Janet Horner said she would press the council to “scale up their ambition” for the street.“If traffic must be maintained here it should be limited to one, traffic-calmed lane – retaining three lanes at points on the street is totally unacceptable. We are well short of the scale of ambition we are seeing all over Europe at the moment for cleaner, safer streets for people not cars,” she said.“We’re moving in the right direction but a lot of this stuff could have and should have been done years ago. Or at the very least over a year ago when the pandemic began and it became clear that we needed to restructure the streets.”The Dublin Commuter Coalition, a sustainable transport lobby group, said the plan prioritises traffic flow over pedestrian space.Submissions on the plans can be made until May 14th at consultation.dublincity.ietraffic-and-transportcapel-street-increasing-pedestrian-spaceEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 hse advises people to wear face masks as restrictions ease","story":"Mary Plunkett, education officer, at a Wharfedale printing press in the National Print Museum in Beggars Bush, Dublin: Museum staff are preparing to reopen its doors on Monday. Photograph: Donall FarmerFamilies have been advised to maintain social distancing and to wear masks when meeting after Covid-19 restrictions are eased next week. The so-called “vaccine bonus” will see fully vaccinated people from up to three households permitted to mix indoors from Monday. The same will also apply to those who received a first AstraZeneca shot more than four weeks ago and to people who have had a PCR test confirmed infection in the past six months. These groups can also meet indoors with unvaccinated people from another household, provided they are not at risk of severe illness. The measures aim to benefit older people and those with health conditions who have had to spend lengthy periods cocooning since the pandemic began. While home visits among vaccinated people do not technically require masks or social distancing, health officials are stressing the need to continue to follow advice on hygiene and to act appropriately in the interest of safety. Speaking on RTÉ’s News at One on Friday, HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said it was appropriate for grandparents to have physical contact with grandchildren “provided you keep a small number of people in your social bubble if that’s going to include grandchildren, well and good”.Underscoring the impact of vaccines, he said, recipients “have a much, much greater reduction, or reduced chance of becoming sick or hospitalised” with Covid-19 as a result of their jabs. He said the risk of infection and illness fell “perhaps 90 per cent or more after two doses and certainly 80 per cent or more in some cases after the first dose”. However, Dr Henry stressed his preference for mask wearing where possible and for people to limit their social contacts. A series of other restrictions are being eased from Monday, allowing people to meet in groups outdoors, travel outside their county and the reopening of some economic activity. A maximum of three households or six people from any number of households can come together outside, including in private gardens, and the limit of six will not include children aged 12 or younger. Organised outdoor gatherings with a maximum of 15 people and outdoor training for adults in pods of up to the same number will also be allowed. Religious services can resume, although ceremonies such as Communions and Confirmations are not being permitted to go ahead for now, and caps on funeral attendances, a major bone of contention in recent months, will increase to 50. However, “related events” before or after are to remain on hold.Fifty guests are allowed at wedding services but receptions and celebrations remain restricted to six indoors and 15 outdoors. Retail will undergo a phased reopening from Monday with click-and-collect services and in-store appointments permitted ahead of shops opening more normally from May 17th. Personal services such as hairdressers and salons can reopen on an appointment-only basis. Galleries, museums and cultural attractions too will reopen to the public as will lending services in libraries. Public transport capacity will be increased to 50 per cent. Case study: ‘It could be a slow staggered return or we could see a flurry’At the National Print Museum in Dublin’s Beggar’s Bush, staff have been busily preparing to reopen their doors to visitors. But, like the industry generally, they do not know what to expect. “It could go one of two ways,” said chief executive Carla Marrinan. “It could be a slow staggered return or we could see a flurry. You never know.” Despite the prevailing uncertainty, Ms Marrinan is focused on what they will offer next week – two new exhibitions, including one on pandemic-produced artworks – and reassurance that museums are safe to visit. Things have been so negative in the cultural arena, positivity is crucial. The museum not only saw a collapse in visitors, but also in corporate revenue and income from the venue being hired. Propped up by some State funding, it has survived and its new approach is toward self-guided tours in a well-ventilated, spacious building that still has culture at its centre.“The big concern now is that we won’t see a big return,” Ms Marrinan said, noting that last summer people left the capital while tourism dried up. “A lot of them were sick of their 5km and were getting out of Dublin and because of Covid people were a bit too nervous to come back.” The museum managed to retain all staff and they have been working with an eye on reopening, but their uncertainty about the week ahead is common in an era where people have been drilled on the importance of staying outside. Gina O’Kelly, executive director of the Irish Museums Association (IMA), which represents about 80 institutions on the island, said many would not reopen next week, preferring to await the return of “audience confidence”. The problem is particularly acute for independent outfits lacking the kind of central State funding that fuels the national cultural institutions. Those largely dependent on entrance fees, cafes and gift shops are under considerably more pressure to turn the cash flow back on. However, Ms O’Kelly said those accustomed to operating in a historically under-funded industry may prove best placed to survive.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

Shortly afterwards, details appeared on the Pym account. Management approached Harris and he admitted contributing to the account. This account was confirmed by Harris to The  on Friday.Harris told The  he thought the poll results were in the public domain at the time that the Pym account shared them.On Friday, Twitter suspended the Pym account on the grounds it broke the platform’s rules on “platform manipulation”.The company bans the use of accounts which “artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behaviour that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience on Twitter”. It also banned a further eight accounts, which it said were linked to the Pym account.Some of these accounts had also been used to share vitriolic anti-Sinn Féin content. However, Harris said he was only involved in the Pym account, which he operated with five or six other people.He declined to name these people, saying he did not want to “get them shot”.Since February 2020, the Pym account has frequently criticised, and sometimes insulted, politicians, journalists and other public figures, who it suggested were pro-Sinn Féin.It was also regularly used to praise the work of Harris and his colleagues at the newspaper, while railing against other journalists’ work.One of those criticised by the account, Irish Examiner political correspondent Aoife Grace Moore, alleged on Twitter that the Pym account had sent her sexualised messages and had called her a terrorist, resulting in her seeking counselling.ComplaintHarris admitted the account was used to send tweets asking if Moore was “turned on” by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald being the first woman to lead the Opposition as well as tweets referring to her “sniping safely from behind Derry hedges,” adding that “her SF backside is sticking up in the air”.However, he said these were “clearly political and could equally be applied to a man”.It is understood a complaint has been made to gardaí in Pearse Street, Dublin, regarding abusive tweets sent to Moore.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireNon-essential cross-Border travel must be stopped “by enforcement if required”, Northern Ireland’s Health Minister has warned.In a letter to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, Robin Swann warned of a spike in Covid-19 cases in Border counties.The lifting of pandemic restrictions and the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland has outpaced those in the Republic, raising fresh concerns over cross-Border travel.In a letter to Mr Donnelly on Wednesday, Mr Swann warned of a “fresh increase of community transmission of Covid-19”.He said that governments in both jurisdictions should do everything possible to prevent non-essential cross-Border travel.The letter said: “I wish to place on record my concern at the potential for cross-Border interactions to fuel a fresh increase in community transmission and Covid-19 cases in respective jurisdictions.“Our two jurisdictions are at different junctures, in terms of number of cases, the current trajectory of the epidemic, vaccination progress and Covid-19 restrictions.“However, that should not hamper continued co-operation in key areas.“In particular, I believe we should be doing all we can to prevent non-essential cross-Border travel at this time.“This will require clear messaging, backed up by enforcement if required.”Mr Swann requested an urgent meeting with Mr Donnelly, department officials and senior public health bosses from both jurisdictions “to consider what additional actions are required”.He said recent data from both sides of the Border “must be taken seriously and elicit an appropriate response”.The letter adds: “In the present circumstances, crossing the border for non-essential shopping or socialising purposes creates an unnecessary risk of virus spread.“The island, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland — and not least its Border areas — has suffered too much already to allow that to happen.”On Sunday, the HSE and the Public Health Agency (PHA) issued a joint statement warning of the risks of an increase in transmission.It follows concerns around a spike in cases in Co Donegal.

While the US has kept a tight lid on exports of American-made vaccines so it can inoculate its own population first, the EU has become the world’s leading provider, allowing about as many doses to go outside the 27-nation bloc as are kept for its 446 million inhabitants.The EU has distributed about 200 million doses within the bloc while about the same amount has been exported abroad to almost 90 countries.“First of all, you must open up,” said Mr Macron. “In the United States, in the United Kingdom, 100 per cent of what has been produced has been used in the domestic market.”He added that “first of all, the Anglo Saxons must stop their bans on exports”.The EU is trying to regain the diplomatic initiative on vaccines after Mr Biden put it on the back foot with his surprising endorsement of lifting patent protections on Covid-19 vaccines, seeking to solve the problem of getting jabs to people in poorer countries.Mr Macron and other EU leaders have insisted that first of all production capacity must be ramped up by, among other things, reconverting factories so they can quickly start producing vaccines through a transfer of technology. Developed nations should also increase vaccine donations to poorer countries.Only after that, Mr Macron said, can the debate on patent waivers start having an impact.“Today, there is not a factory in the world that cannot produce doses for poor countries because of a patent issue,” he added. –PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Travel operators lay on more flights to cope with pent-up demand for holidaysWhy Colombia\u0026#39s deadly riots are a warning sign for a continent smashed by CovidMan arrested in hunt for PCSO Julia James\u0026#39s killerElection results 2021: SNP insists it has IndyRef2 mandate even with no majority thanks to Greens Wales election results: Labour set to win Senedd after surprise performanceCount begins in Scotland with IndyRef2 on a knife edgeCoronavirus latest news: Third wave could be later and less damaging, Government adviser saysCount begins in London as Sadiq Khan faces fight for second term as mayorMay 2021 election results: the maps, charts and data of how your area voted across the UKLondon mayoral election results 2021: the charts and maps that show how the capital votedLocal election results 2021: how your council voted and how the numbers map across EnglandScottish election results 2021: the charts and maps that show how Scotland votedVE Day 2021: The history behind Victory in Europe Day and how to celebrate during Covid-19Jill Mortimer: could Hartlepool history maker prove a thorn in side for Tories?The jazz diet?

The system can adjust in just five milliseconds, and the movement is completed in total silence with vibration-free adjustment”.The table’s ball pockets are made from stainless steel and are lined with the same leather used in Bugatti cars. As if that was not enough the tables come with a 13-inch, high-resolution touch screen to keep track of scores and the carbon fiber pool cues feature anodized and precision machined aluminum ends made to the same design of the buttons of Bugatti sports cars.Chris Cecil-Wright, one of London’s leading yacht brokers, said the pool table was the perfect accessory for owners looking to fit out their boats with whatever takes their fancy.“This is a lovely toy, perfect for people who are so immensely wealthy that if they can imagine something for their boat, whatever it is, then it’s possible,” he said.Mr Cecil-Wright, who has fitted ping-pong tables, basketball courts, mini-tennis and badminton courts to his clients’ boats, and even a gyroscope cabin designed to prevent seasickness, added: “If you can imagine it you can make it possible.”Other official Bugatti accessories with the pool table include a suitcase made in Bugatti leather to transport the set of Aramith Tournament Pro balls.Pedro Sanchez, General Manager at IXO, the Spanish carbon fibre specialists manufacturing the pool tables for Bugatti, said: “When we started developing the Bugatti Pool Table project, we knew we had to be different and excel in all areas in order to be extraordinary. Nothing has been spared.”The first five tables were snapped up within hours, with buyers including a Polish millionaire, a Canadian, two Dubai entrepreneurs and a collector who ordered one in the same colour as his £1.3m Bugatti Veyron sports car.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"french authorities ban jersey fishermen landing catch three","story":"French authorities have announced that Jersey fishermen will be banned from landing their catch at three ports in response to the row over post-Brexit fishing rights. In a tit-for-tat retaliation, local leaders in La Manche, Normandy, said that boats from the Channel island would be suspended from entering the ports of Granville, Barneville-Carteret and Dielette until further notice.It came as Jersey fishermen on Friday told The  they had been unable to land their hauls since Monday, with one fisherman actively prevented from landing in Carteret on Thursday afternoon.Responding on Friday night, Ian Gorst, Jersey’s minister for external relations, said that it regretted the decision and believed it fell foul of the Brexit trade deal. “For that reason we are referring the notice of this decision immediately to the European Commission,” he said in a statement.It follows Jersey’s decision last week to impose new restrictions on fishing licences granted to French vessels in its waters, in a move which has provoked outcry in Paris. Brussels has also intervened, claiming that the move is discriminatory and in breach of the Brexit trade deal agreed with the UK last year. After the French government threatened to cut off electricity supplies to the island, a flotilla of 60 fishing boats blockaded its main port of St Helier on Thursday, in an escalation which prompted Boris Johnson to dispatch two Royal Navy vessels. The fishermen have threatened to return unless Jersey backs down, but Downing Street has insisted that the Crown Dependency commands its full support and has complied with the trade agreement. Read more: Calm after the storm as Jersey\u0027s fishermen head back out to seaHowever, it now appears that Jersey’s fishermen are bearing the brunt of France’s anger.Speaking to The  on Friday, Ian Gorst, Jersey’s external relations minister, said: “It’s not fair our fishermen are being blocked. We want to work to solve the problem for the licences. We really don\u0027t believe it\u0027s a problem of our making, but you need to make sure that member states are allowing access to the market appropriately.”Asked why Jersey fishermen are being caught up in the situation he said sadly that\u0027s inevitable and that\u0027s why it\u0027s a bit frustrating to have all the drama.Mr Gorst told The  he had previously delivered a “dossier” of the issues facing Jersey fishermen to the EU Fisheries Commissioner and things had started to get better but now they’ve “dropped off a cliff again”.Local fishermen said they had already been prevented from landing their catch of whelks and scallops for months, due to the imposition of an EU-wide ban on the export of live bivalve molluscs from Britain’s class B waters.Don Thompson, chair of the Jersey Fishermen\u0027s Association, said: “The real hardship genuinely is on this side and I\u0027m seeing my colleagues going out of business, fishermen that have done nothing else all their life, made a commitment to the industry since they were very young, having to sell their boats and walk away from the industry.Leon Dessoude, a commercial fisherman in Jersey for 15 years, said “it’s got to be access for access”.“If you’ve got issues you’ve got to be able to talk to about it, all of this coming over here with an Armada and threatening to close the ports (doesn’t help),” he said. Meanwhile, EU sources said on Friday night said that a number of European countries were now discussing potential retaliatory measures, should their fishermen also face similar restrictions.Germany, Netherland, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Ireland and Belgium are the EU countries with the greatest fishing interest in UK waters.One diplomat said the issue had been touched upon in a working group and that the issue of historic licences would be looked into more deeply in a future meeting of envoys.“That is how it is seen here in Brussels and French fishermen don\u0027t like to be messed with.”A second said: There is anxiety that the UK will try to skirt what was agreed under the trade deal.“This is apparently a localised problem associated with local Jersey legislation. So no problem for us yet. This will change if this is translated into a wider Channel policy and or French fishermen start blocking European colleagues in other waters having lost access to the British waters.”There are a series of dispute resolution mechanisms in the trade deal but ultimately the EU could freeze parts of the deal or impose tariffs if the row is not resolved. There are also a string of other trade areas where the UK is dependent on EU approval for exports.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"french authorities ban jersey fishermen landing catch three2","story":"Jersey\u0027s main fishing quay was still and serene on Friday morning as fishermen prepared their boats to head out on the water. The peace was a far cry from events the day before, when around 60 French vessels attempted to block the island’s main harbour, St Helier, in protest at the licensing restrictions. The fishermen let off flares, displayed banners including one that said Jersey Government kill us and caused delays to the island\u0027s freight shipping service. Leon Dessoude, 60, who has fished his whole life but has done so commercially for around 15 years, said he understood why his French counterparts were angry.They did have a free range and they did do what they liked, he told The  as he boarded his boat with his Jack Russell, Luna.But he added that he thinks the protest may be a good thing for Jersey fishermen who have faced restrictions to what they can now land in France post-Brexit.“When I heard that the gunboat was coming and the Government was involved I thought well, whatever Jersey does now with the French there could be reciprocal effects, he explained, saying the Government would now be watching what Mr Gorst does in response to the row. Asked whether he thought any concessions would be given to the French fishermen, he added: Watch this space. Jersey and France have fished in each other\u0027s waters since 2000, under the Bay of Granville Treaty, but the treaty became void following Brexit in December.In the new licensing system, which began on May 1, French vessels had to apply for permits from the Jersey Government. But French officials say additional restrictions were added, including where the vessels can fish and for how long. In response, the flotilla of French ships staged their protest on Thursday morning. It resulted in a delegation of the Jersey government meeting with some of the fishermen to hear their grievances. Mr Gorst told The  it was a listening exercise and it became apparent there had been a problem in communication over the licences. He said the Jersey government would now work with the UK, EU and France to try and resolve the issue. But Mr Dessoude voiced concern that, if the issues are not resolved soon, it could have a damaging impact on the Jersey fishing fleet. The Regional Fishing Committees of Normandy and Brittany called for a ban on Jersey catch being landed in Granville earlier this week, a measure reportedly supported by the Mayor of Granville.Only around 10 per cent of the lobsters caught by Jersey boats are sold onto the island, the rest are usually sold into the French market, Mr Dessoude said.In his 60s and with no financial dependants, Mr Dessoude said he could afford to not go out daily, but the row is having a knock-on effect for his business. With larger boats unable to take their hauls to France they are selling lobsters in Jersey, meaning demand is even lower.He fishes for cuttlefish in April and May but said that, due to bad weather, the hauls have been low this year. I\u0027m more worried about the younger generations, he explained, adding that it is a huge expense to buy and run a fishing vessel and warning: If they don’t remove the ban this week, some of the small boats could go under,.Don Thompson, the president of the Jersey Fishermen\u0027s Association, said all the focus in the row had been on the French fleet, adding: They\u0027ve actually been given four months of amnesty to carry on fishing whilst they make applications for licences to fish in our waters... whilst our fishermen have been banned from landing into France.The real hardship genuinely is on this side, and I\u0027m seeing my colleagues going out of business, fishermen that have done nothing else all their life, made a commitment to the industry since they were very young, having to sell their boats and walk away from the industry.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"may 2021 election results uk maps charts data wales votes","story":"The outcome of the 2021 Scottish Parliament election is on a knife-edge, as vote counting in a contest that could prove critical for the future of the Union continues on Saturday. First Minister and Scottish Nationalist Party leader Nicola Sturgeon is hoping for an outright majority in the devolved parliament in Holyrood, after her party saw early gains in the first results declared on Friday.Yet in an exclusive interview with The  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made clear he would reject calls for a second independence referendum even if she passes the critical 65-seat threshold for overall control.Meanwhile the first wave of English results from the May 6 elections have painted a bleak picture for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, following a historic Conservative win in the Hartlepool by-election and gains on key councils.Millions of Britons across on Thursday voted in a bumper crop of elections – the UK\u0027s first major democratic exercise since the country was hit by coronavirus last year. So-called Super Thursday saw people cast their ballots in a wide variety of races - some delayed due to the pandemic - that include 143 English councils, the Scottish and Welsh devolved parliaments and the London mayoral contest.See below for live results for all of these major elections – or alternatively use our postcode tool to find specific tallies for the elections in your local area. A total of 143 council elections were held in England on Thursday, with around 5,000 seats up for grabs in local authorities ranging from shire county councils to metropolitan boroughs. Local returning officers are continuing to deliver council results on Saturday, after declarations on Friday suggested a disappointing election for Labour amid gains for the Conservatives.Harlow, a local district in the west of Essex, has seen seven new Tory councillors, enough for the party to gain a majority after after nine years of Labour control.The Conservatives have also clinched enough seats to gain a majority on Nuneaton \u0026amp Bedford, Dudley and Northumberland, all of which previously had no party with overall control. But Labour have managed to hold onto some key councils, including Newcastle and South Tyneside, despite losing seats.Council elections are one of the big battlegrounds of Super Thursday, with all eyes on the results from the Red Wall –Labour heartlands that swung to the Conservatives at the 2019 general election. Local council elections results map and data as the votes are countedSuper Thursday also saw people in Scotland vote for 129 MSPs to sit in the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood - a number split between 73 that represent constituencies and 56 that represent the eight regions of the country. This means Ms Sturgeon would need to achieve at least 65 seats for a majority.Nicola Sturgeon was on Friday night heading for a clear Holyrood election win – but may miss out on the SNP majority that would place huge pressure on Boris Johnson to drop his opposition to a second independence referendum.Declarations are now continuing on Saturday, with the race on a knife-edge. The SNP fell two short of a majority in the last election in 2016, having previously gained the first majority in the Scottish Parliament in 2011. If the SNP achieves a majority - or does so with other pro-independence parties - it has vowed to push ahead with an 11-point roadmap on securing a second referendum on Scottish independence. In the past year, polls have suggested a surge in support for independence but this has gradually subsided over recent weeks. Results for the Scottish Parliament are expected to trickle in until a final result is announced on Saturday evening. This time around, the Scottish Tories lost to the SNP two of the seven constituencies they won in the 2016 election following a huge surge in turnout from nationalist voters. With nationalists also gaining East Lothian from Labour and holding all their 2016 seats, they were edging towards the 65 seats needed for a majority.But it is still early days and more gains will be needed to secure the majority. Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford said his party had exceeded expectations, as he comes within touching distance of an overall majority in the Welsh Parliament.The results of the Senedd\u0027s remaining regional seats are set to be announced on Saturday, with coronavirus restrictions at count venues having slowed down the process.Wales represents another big test for Labour, which is currently in power in the nation\u0027s devolved parliament, the Senedd.Voters will be electing 60 representatives and, like in Scotland, get two votes - one for their constituency, and one for their region.The campaign has in large part focused on several north Wales battlegrounds such as the Vale of Clwyd, Delyn and Wrexham, constituencies that the Tories gained from Labour at Westminster in 2019.  No party has ever secured a majority in the Senedd since its establishment in 1999, although Labour has always been the largest party and has often fallen just short of the 31 votes needed to secure the body.  Meanwhile London is getting closer to knowing who will be its next mayor, as the count across the capital continues.Sadiq Khan of Labour is running for re-election, with polls in the final days of the campaign indicating he has a firm lead over Shaun Bailey, his Conservative opponent.The final result from the election may not be clear until Saturday afternoon at the earliest due in part to the voting system used in the capital.Londoners have indicated both a first and second preference for mayor on their ballots, with counting set to begin on 7am on Friday.If no candidate gets at least 50 per cent of first preference votes, all but the top two candidates are eliminated, and counting of second preference votes begins.Aside from their next mayor, residents of the capital cast their vote in London Assembly elections. The 25-member body is part of the Greater London Authority and scrutinises the activities of the mayor. Currently Labour is the biggest party in the body with 12 seats, followed by the Conservatives on eight, the Green party on two, Brexit Alliance on two and the Liberal Democrats on one.Labour have been the largest party in the Assembly since 2012. Dominating the early results from the May 6 election was the by-election Hartlepool, which has now turned blue for the first time since it was created, in turn punching another hole in the Red Wall. In an historic defeat for Labour, Hartlepool voted for the Tory candidate, Jill Mortimer, by 15, 529 votes to Labour’s 8,589, meaning she will now take up a seat as an MP in Westminster. The fallout from the result has circled chiefly around Mr Starmer, who has faced bitter disappointment within his own party over the loss of a core seat. The defeat is the worst result for Labour in what has consistently been a heartland for the party since the constituency was formed in 1974.Many additional elections took place on Thursday, including 39 police and crime commissioners in England. These elected officials are responsible for scrutinising chief police officers in their area, as well as setting the priorities of each force. There are also 12 other directly elected mayors on the ballot outside of London, with races in the West Midlands and West of England.Running for a second time to keep his seat blue is Andy Street, a former chief executive of John Lewis who has been the West Midlands mayor since 2017. He won the seat against the odds when Labour dominated four of the seven councils, and is now running against Liam Byrne, a former Cabinet minister under Gordon Brown.  And in Greater Manchester, Labour\u0027s Andy Burnham is set to capitalise on his robust defence of the city against local restrictions imposed by Westminster. In West Yorkshire, the combined authority – which brings together York, Leeds and Bradford, amongst others – is voting for a mayor for the first time.Our results data are provided by the Press Association. Changes are calculated against a council\u0027s or parliament\u0027s composition at the time of the election, rather than against the composition resulting from the previous election.

It could be glorious on a sunny day with all the cafes.”I asked her if Brexit was also an important issue. She looked at me with pitying puzzlement. “No my dear. Boris got Brexit done, remember? It’s time to prosper and move on.” It was a sentiment I heard again and again in Hartlepool, in the run-up to Thursday’s election. Not rage, but a weariness. Not anti-Remain spite but pro-Leave pride. Not fanatical despondency, but pragmatic hope. The metropolitan Left’s theory goes that Hartlepool is merely a belated Leaver rebellion – the Tories would have won the seat in 2019 anyway, had Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party not split the vote. With this option removed, one-issue voters have been pulled by the gravity of their dismally simple logic towards the Tories. Such an analysis sums up the liberal Left’s take on the current state of British politics: that the Red Wall is in the grips of a naive and temporary rebellion. That its inhabitants, who seethe with a sort of philistine adolescence, are both short-sighted and hold long grudges. That the working-class’s deviant tryst with Tory predators will still all end in tears and, when the whole Brexit thing is forgotten, they will soon come crawling back.This narrative is as incorrect as it is offensive. Labour candidate Paul Williams not only failed to win back Brexit Party supporters who turned against his party at the last election his share of the vote actually plummeted nine points compared with 2019. This is a profound development. In theory, Labour should have been able to leverage Teeside’s historic anti-Thatcher tribalism to win back Brexit Party voters. In theory, practicing GP Dr Williams should have been able to rally the working-class in reverence of the NHS sacred cow. But the old rules no longer apply. They are as redundant as old Labour tropes about bourgeois Tory sleaze and posh Etonian scum. With voters no longer voting along traditional class lines, the old certainties no longer apply.One certainty, however, is that Tory Jill Mortimer’s victory in Hartlepool cannot be put down simply to Brexit. On the campaign trail, I raised it again and again with locals, who looked nonplussed. Some even seemed actively irritated at the political bubble’s obsession. As an ice cream vendor explained to me with strained patience: “We asked them to do Brexit and they did it. Now we’ve got more important things to think about, like a pandemic.” When the Liberal Democrat candidate assured me that he had only heard it raised once on the doorstep, I believed him. Resentment against Labour in places like Hartlepool is much bigger than Brexit. Its scathing, unfocused quality should deeply worry the Left: accusations that Labour and its “nasty corrupt councillors” had “taken Hartlepool for granted” were abundant, peppered with snorts of dismay at Keir Starmer taking the knee. Not that Hartlepudlians are born-again Tories. I met many who still bristle at the harshness of Thatcher. They are suspicious of the Tory machine’s refusal to field a local candidate. They are not wholly convinced that Westminster Tories really have the commercial skill and grassroots knowledge to redevelop their town. In the end, though, the rejection of modern Labour has proved more powerful than historic suspicion of the Tories.In other words, the Tory Hartlepool landslide is the first major sign that what we are witnessing across the “Red Wall” is not a temporary revolt but a potentially permanent revolution against Labour in its former heartlands. Labour’s demise in such areas is not down to a single event. Nor can it be blamed on its policies, or even Keir Starmer’s bland leadership. Clinging to Brexit as a comfort blanket to avoid this harsh reality will not do. The estrangement is cultural. Labour simply no longer emotionally connects with its former core. Despite strenuously avoiding the subject of Brexit, the party radiates a mystified disdain for ordinary people. Its woke membership think patriotism is a dangerous Middle English fundamentalism. Its bourgeois MPs regard towns that brim with potential, such as Hartlepool, as “left behind” cesspits. The hard-Left continues to blame its defeats on the depthless selfishness of the electorate. Keir Starmer’s attempts to change voter opinion has proved in vain. They can smell the insincerity of his attempt to embrace flag waving and veterans. Something deeper still is detectable – a sense that Labour no longer knows not only how to connect with people but with the age. Their demise across the North East and the Midlands is beginning to seem redolent of the strange death of Liberal England in the first quarter of the 20th century.With the enfranchisement of the working class, decline of empire and destruction of the First World War, liberal values – freedom, free trade, progress – suddenly seemed quaintly ancient as the writer George Dangerfield put it: nothing more than bits of old iron, fragments of intimate crockery, and other relics of a domestic past. Today, with the rise of consumerism, an impatiently ambitious lower-middle class, and international volatility, Labour values of class solidarity and corporate globalism seem cloyingly anachronistic.The Liberals ultimately disintegrated because the man they spoke to no longer existed. Labour has a similar problem: the flat-capped, unionised working class is a thing of the past. Centre-groundish Mondeo man is, it turns out, a culturally conservative patriot.Perhaps then it isn’t hyperbolic to talk of a historic realignment in British politics. One senses that, just as Labour is yet to reach rock bottom, we are yet to fully grasp the profundity of their crisis.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"al fresco britain has washout please let us back inside pubs","story":"I know Samuel Johnson coined his witticism “the triumph of hope over experience” for second marriages, but it’s even better suited to the British weather.

Sixty per cent of all holidays sold yesterday were to Portugal.The firm said new flights and extra holidays have been added for people who want to get away as quickly as possible.People returning to England from a green destination from May 17 will not be required to self-isolate and are only required to take one post-arrival coronavirus test.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the removal of the ban on international leisure travel is “necessarily cautious\u0027\u0027.But Virgin Atlantic called for the US to be added to the green list, while the iindustry body Airlines UK urged the Government to make “major additions” to the green list at the next review point in three weeks. A Virgin Atlantic spokesman said of the quarantine-free list: “There is no reason for the US to be absent from the green list. This overly cautious approach fails to reap the benefits of the UK\u0027s successful vaccination programme.”Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said: “This is a missed opportunity and, with so few countries making it on to the green list, represents a reopening of air travel in name only.“By contrast, the EU has said vaccinated people will be able to travel without restrictions, which leaves the UK at risk of falling behind and not opening up international travel to key markets across Europe as well as the United States.”Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots\u0027 union Balpa, accused the Government of an “excess of caution”,  adding: “\u0027Almost all tourist hotspots in Europe, including Spain, France and Greece, are in the amber category, which is as good as red as far as most tourists are concerned, with potential 10-day quarantine needed on return.”“Tourists are sat gazing at the amber light, revving their engines, desperate to travel safe in the knowledge that their jabs will protect them. The Government must flick those amber lights to green as soon as it possibly can.”The unveiling of the green list led to prices for a return ticket from London Heathrow to Portuguese capital Lisbon to soar from £264 before the announcement to £332 afterwards. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"treat loved ones like hostages beg family british citizens detained","story":"When Iranian media reported last week that Britain was about to settle a £400 million debt in exchange for release of prisoners held in Iran, the mood in Anoosheh Ashoori\u0027s cell in Tehran\u0027s Evin prison rose.There was a sense of massive excitement in the prison ward. It was like a spark of hope among the prisoners, said Sherry Izadi, his wife. I had to tell him on the phone that both sides had denied it, but that didn\u0027t seem to deter him.Mr Ashoori, a 67-year-old London businessman, is one of several British-Iranian prisoners whose families say are being held hostage to force Britain to settle the decades-old debt from a botched arms deal.The suggestion that a quid-pro-quo was finally being sought brought them a sense of excitement - it is the only way he and other prisoners, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, believe they will get home.But it also provoked a furious debate between those who believe Britain should pay off the debt the Ministry of Defence company International Military Services acknowledges it owes, and those who fear it will  simply encourage Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps to take more hostages.For the families of the detained, the debate has brought out another certainty - that the entire case has been deeply mishandled.“Empirically, the government needs to look  at its hostage policy. I have not seen any honest recounting about what works and what doesn’t,” said Richard Ratcliffe, Nazanin\u0027s husband. “The British approach - the idea we don’t pay ransoms - well it is only since the 1970s we’ve not done it. It is ideological. It is not like we are looking at what does and what doesn’t work.”One of the families’ main frustrations is that the governments involved will not officially acknowledge that the issue is a hostage crisis rather than a consular dispute.James Cleverly, the minister for the Middle East, said it was completely inappropriate to link the detention of British nationals to the debt. They are separate issues, one massively predates the other.Iranian diplomatic sources also insist that there is no link between the prisoners and the IMS debt, saying charges against Mrs Ratcliffe, Mr Ashoori, and the others are purely a matter for the judiciary.Both sides have an interest in this denial.  The hostages’ side cannot be seen to be paying a ransom, lest it encourage more hostage taking.  For the hostage-taking side, minimising the embarrassment makes it easier for the money to be paid.For the Ratcliffes and the Ashooris, such dissemblance is utterly infuriating.Mr Ratcliffe says his wife has been told told quite explicitly that if she wants to go home, the UK must settle the tank debt.Last month a hearing on the IMS debt case at the London high court was postponed at the eleventh hour, apparently at Iran\u0027s request.That could be a sign that an out of court settlement is being negotiated. But one week later an Iranian court handed Mrs Zaghari Ratcliffe a new sentence. The timing, her husband believes, was no mistake. Mrs Izadi says her husband was more obliquely informed about a link between his case and the debt by an anonymous stranger in the early stages of his detention in Tehran. “So we began digging, and we cannot find any other explanation for his detention,” she said.And keeping quiet has not worked. “We were quiet for two years and nothing happened. Two years is ample time for diplomacy to work if it is the correct diplomacy,” said Sherry Izadi.“However it is resolved I think it is definitely something the FCO has to consider for the future. A form of policy has to be put in place for to prevent or to provide a clear outline for how the should be dealt with, she added. Paying off the debt in a direct trade off is not universally popular.Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, compared it to Aethelred the Unready’s successive attempts to buy peace with viking invaders.“Paying for hostages leads to... more hostages,” he wrote on Twitter “We\u0027ve tried that policy before. At first we called it Danegeld - the gold we had to pay the Danes to stop them raiding Britain. When the policy had failed completely, we stopped calling it Danegeld and simply called it tax.”But Mr Ratcliffe and Mrs Izadi are both unimpressed with such arguments.Firstly, they point out, the Iranian demand is for a debt that Britain acknowledges it should pay. As far as they are concerned, a British tussle with a known hostage-taking regime placed their relatives in danger.Secondly, says Mr Ratcliffe, refusing to pay simply has not deterred further hostage taking. Since his wife was arrested at Tehran airport in 2016, at least  three more Britons have been detained: Mr Ashoori in 2017,  Morad Tahbaz, the co-founder of the Persian Wildlife Heritage foundation, in 2018, and Mehran Raoof, a labour rights activist, in 2020. The  understands there are several more whose families have chosen to remain anonymous.“It is an international market, he said. They specifically want something off the Brits. But they also hold nationals from all across the world, so the logic becomes: ok the Brits not pay, but if we squeeze the British prisoners then the Spanish or French will pay up to avoid that. You just play a different role.”Thirdly, the unpalatable truth is that hostage situations usually end with the Danegeld being paid, in one way or another.In 2016, the US government flew $400 million in cash to Iran in what is widely viewed as an unacknowledged ransom payment for the release for four US citizens.Mr Ratcliffe argues that the sensible approach would be to pay the money to get your prisoners out, then extort a deterrent cost  to stop it from happening again - rather as Somali piracy was overcome by putting armed guards on ships.But to do that, says Mr Ratcliffe, the British government needs to call a spade a spade - and call out hostage diplomacy for what it is.Without doubt the interest of the family are different from the British government, said Mr Ratcliffe. My interest is to keep Nazanin safe. We have been taken as collateral in their dispute. Your fight has come to my door - don\u0027t sit there and tell me I am causing you inconvenience.An FCDO spokesperson said: “We actively seek the immediate and permanent release and return of detained dual British nationals in Iran, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori, and are doing all we can to help them. “The Prime Minister has raised this issue at the highest level with President Rouhani, most recently on 10 March, and the Foreign Secretary continues to engage with Foreign Minister Zarif on it at every opportunity.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"elections 2021 5 key results","story":"NewsElections :  key results from first day of counts across England, Wales and ScotlandResults from the bumper Super Thursday polls are pouring in, offering grim news for Keir Starmer.

Keir Starmer said the party had lost the trust of working people as he came under fire over Labouraposs defeat in the Hartlepool by-election. There was also grim news for Labour in contests for English councils and a landslide victory for the Tories in the Tees Valley mayoral battle.But Wales offered hope to the party where First Minister Mark Drakeford was on course to form a Government after defying gloomy polls.There was drama in Scotland where the SNP won three new seats as Nicola Sturgeon presses for a fresh mandate for another independence referendum.Results will continue to flood in on Saturday and into Sunday, with Labour hoping to win several key mayoral contests, including London, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands.  The Welsh and Scottish Parliament results should become clear on Saturday - with all eyes on Edinburgh as Ms Sturgeon prepares for a clash with Boris Johnson over independence.Hereaposs what you need to know about the results so far. Knives out for Keir Starmer after Hartlepool by-election defeat Labouraposs hopes of rebuilding after the disastrous  election were dealt a fresh blow after the Tories won a key by-election in Hartlepool. Tory Jill Mortimer overturned Labour’s , majority and won the seat with a whopping , majority of her own - increasing the Tory vote by %. The result represents a % swing from Labour to the Tories in a seat that has been red for decades. Critics from the Labour left tore into Mr Starmer over the failure to retain Hartlepool, which prompted soul searching across the party. The Labour leader acknowledged the scale of the challenge, saying Labour had lost the trust of working people. Iaposm bitterly disappointed in the result and I take full responsibility for the results - and I will take full responsibility for fixing this, he said.  On Friday, he failed to deny swirling rumours that he would reshuffle his top team. There was also bad news among English councils. With results available from  out of  councils, the Conservatives had a net gain of six authorities and  seats, and Labour a net loss of four authorities and  seats. But Labouraposs Ros Jones was re-elected Doncaster mayor while Joanne Anderson became Liverpoolaposs first black female mayor. Tories win key mayoral race - as they eye West Midlands Tory Ben Houchen was re-elected as Tees Valley mayor by a landslide, taking almost % of the vote at the first count. His victory cements the Tory presence in the so-called Red Wall - seats in Labouraposs traditional heartlands in the north and Midlands. It was regarded as one of the big three races of the bumper local elections, alongside Hartlepool and the West Midlands. Results should come on Saturday for the West Midlands mayoral race, where Labouraposs Liam Byrne is attempting to topple ex-John Lewis boss Andy Street. However the contest could be close, with the Tories gunning to retain the mayoralty. Labour on course to form a Government in Wales After a grim set of results in England, there was hope for Labour in Wales as the party looked set to win the Senedd election and lead the Welsh Government. First Minister Mark Drakeford said his party had exceeded expectations as it ended Friday with  seats, just one short of a majority. Gloomy polls had predicted Labour was at risk of its worst result and could win fewer than  seats. But the party lost just one of Walesapos red wall seats - Vale of Clwyd - to the Tories, and snatched Rhondda from Plaid Cymru founder Leanne Wood. The results of the last few seats will be announced on Saturday but Labour is in a position to form a Government evenit falls short of the required  majority. SNP hopes for independence majority on a kne edge Nicola Sturgeon has vowed to press ahead with a fresh independence referendum as her partyaposs hopes winning an outright majority in the Scottish Parliament hung in the balance. The SNP needs  seats to win a majority at Holyrood, which Ms Sturgeon has said would give her a clear mandate to demand another border poll. It won  of the  declared seats on Friday, snatching Ayr and Edinburgh Central from the Tories and East Lothian from Labour. But Labouraposs Jackie Baillie held onto Dumbarton, Scotlandaposs most marginal seat, which the SNP had been targeting. Counting continues on Saturday, with the results expected to become clearer in the afternoon. But a clash is coming whatever the result, as the Tories insisted that another referendum would be irresponsible.

In fact, more new cases of Covid have been diagnosed around the world in the last seven days than at any time since the pandemic began.

Crushing defeat in Hartlepool, lost council seats and failing to take back mayoral posts from Boris Johnsonaposs Conservatives leaves Labour still tumbling down an already queasily high electoral mountain. What Labour must do to win again isnapost easy but to start a national conversation here are eight ideas to get the talking started: . What is Labour for  Fundamental yet too many voters donapost know and when they do, donapost like it. Starmer must paint in vivid colours the fairer, stronger, better, more prosperous country heaposd build. The NHS is Labouraposs greatest, most enduring gt to the nation but it needs to offer more than championing a single public service. . Good Policies The perception Labour lacks policies is the ugly twin of too many voters ignorant of what it stands for. Practical, attractive plans and ideas to improve lives that can be shouted from roof tops would fill gaps. . Be Relevant Here the party has to appeal to people in jobs as well as the jobless, self-employed and employed, middle earners and low waged, private and not just public sector workers plus the old alongside the young. One Labour MP complained too many of his constituents thought it represented only benefit claimants and migrants. Thataposs a bigoted caricature and both groups deserve representation anyway but it must appeal to self-interest as much as altruism.  . Optimism Beats Pessimism Be upbeat about the potential of people and Britain and what could be achieved. The triumphant can-do spirit is infectious. The historic mindset of the Left is failures, sell-outs and betrayals. When the countryaposs riddled with injustices and inequalities, families and communities held back, this isnapost a moment for champagne but Labour optimism for change would go a long way. . Culture Matters Locally and nationally, many take pride in their area and the nation. Criticism of Starmer for appearing on TV with union flags is ludicrous. Tories focus on statues to ert people. Brexit serves a similar role. Redefine patriotism as championing British values of fairness and decency - and stop the Tories hijacking flags.

But a Labour source today told the Mirror the London race was definitely closer than people were thinking.The source insisted that, despite polls putting Mr Khan comfortably ahead, we always said it would be a close election. Under Londonaposs election rules, the top two candidates in the first round will then go through to a second round, and pick up any second-preference votes from people who voted for smaller parties. Mr Khanaposs team still appeared to believe heaposs likely to triumph on second preferences, however.  The source said: There is no question we are seeing signicant impact from turnout and voters believing they could put a smaller party first preference without influencing the election result. There are still half of London boroughs to count and it’s too early to say anything with any certainty at this stage. And Pollster Chris Curtis, of Opinium, tweeted on Friday night: If Shaun Bailey gets elected Mayor of London I will run around City Hall naked. A YouGov poll this week had tipped Mr Khan to win % in the first round and Mr Bailey % - narrowing the gap between the pair by five points. However, YouGov had said an upset looked unlikely as in the second round, Mr Khan would triumph with % compared to Mr Baileyaposs %. As of .pm on Friday, Mr Khan had around % of the first-round votes counted compared to Mr Baileyaposs % - although that included earlier-declaring, Tory-voting outer boroughs in the capital so is not a reliable tally. The Times reported tonight that Mr Baileyaposs campaign believed he could actually win the London mayoralty. Another source close to the Tory appeared less optimistic, though, telling the Guido Fawkes blog: It’s closer than everyone thinks. Still a long way to go though, but Shaun will have beaten the polls by a fair whack. The speculation comes despite a string of gaffes by Mr Bailey, including claiming people would spend a Universal Basic Income on lots of drugs.  It comes after Keir Starmer said he would do whatever it takes to rebuild after a bitterly disappointing defeat in the Hartlepool by-election. Tory Jill Mortimer snatched the seat from Labour with a majority of nearly , votes in a stunning victory for Boris Johnson.And there was further misery for the party in the local elections as Labour lost control of Harlow, Rossendale and Sheffield councils - and failed to make any major gains as the first results came in. The result sparked immediate recriminations, with Labouraposs left wing piling in to criticise Mr Starmeraposs leadership. In a terse statement, he said: Iaposm bitterly disappointed in the result and I take full responsibility for the results - and I will take full responsibility for fixing this. We have changed as a party but we havenapost set out a strong enough case to the country.

Keir Starmeraposs party suffered losses in a swathe of English council seats as voters shrugged off Tory sleaze revelations to back Boris Johnson. And in the Tees Valley mayoral contest, Conservative incumbent Ben Houchen trounced his Labour rival by a landslide, with % of votes to %. The West Midlands mayoral result, due on Saturday, could pile on the agony for Labour as Tory strategists are confident of victory for reigning mayor Andy Street. Even London’s mayor race, where Sadiq Khan had been set to romp home by a wide margin, is “definitely closer” than people thought, sources admit.  A fresh ballot box meltdown across England saw electors switch to the Conservatives following  years of Tory rule from Westminster – prompting another round of Labour soul-searching and tough questions for Mr Starmeraposs -month premiership. But the results are not all rosy for the Tories - whose vote share in Scotland was actually down in early counting. With the SNP gaining three Holyrood seats in early results, Nicola Sturgeon appeared to be inching close to a majority in the Scottish Parliament. That would allow her to launch a fresh and brutal push for independence - which could split the UK apart within just a few years. But there was joy for Labour in Wales where Mark Drakefordaposs party confounded gloomy polls to win half the Senedd seats. The Tories took just one of Walesapos red wall seat - Vale of Clywd - which left Labour on course to form a Government. Results will continue to pour in until Sunday, with the picture expected to be clearer for the Welsh and Scottish Parliamentaposs later today.

ENGLISH COUNCILS: More than , seats were up for grabs on  county,  unitary,  metropolitan and  district councils in England. Results across the country showed the Tories doing very well at Labouraposs expense - despite many of the seats that were up for election being lost by Labour last time. Labour lost a whopping  seats in traditional bellwether Nuneaton and Bedworth. The Tories snatched Harlow in Essex from Labour after seven seats changed hands and took Northumberland from no overall control. Dudley - where Labour and the Tories were practically neck and neck before - went to the Tories with a massive cull of red seats. Conservatives now have  seats, almost double Labouraposs .

Itaposs not a landslide and was still too close to call on Friday nightthere would be an SNP majority. Nicola Sturgeon won in her seat but on a slightly reduced vote share, as Labour leader Anas Sarwar notched up more than , votes standing against her. Results Friday afternoon through to Saturday night. WELSH PARLIAMENT: All  seats were up for grabs and polls suggested Labour - while the biggest party - had an uphill struggle to win an overall majority.

Only one of Walesapos so-called red wall seats, the Vale of Clwyd, fell to the Welsh Conservatives in early counting while Labour held Wrexham. Labour also unseated the former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in Rhondda. Results Friday afternoon and evening.  ENGLISH MAYORS: The biggest battles were over Tory-held West Midlands, Tees Valley and West of England, but Labouraposs hopes of making in-roads were fading fast.

It does not rain but it pours for Labour as the Prime Minister rejoiced in yet another demolition job on the former aposRed Wallapos of Labour-held constituencies.Peter Cook, , a lelong Labour voter before the  General election, a trade unionist and former shop steward, said: The biggest mistake Labour made here was when they brought in a rejected former MP from Stockton who had supported Remain and attacked people who wanted to come out of Europe. I was disgusted, Brexit was the big issue for me - the vast majority of the town rejected staying in Europe.Pardon my French, I think Boris Johnson has made a right b**** of it especially for the fishing industry in this country. I had previously voted Labour, but I donapost knowI will vote for them again in my letime. And he warned Keir Starmer that he needed to get out of the Westminster bubble - and fast. I am not interested in Borisapos wallpaper, he said. We need to look at where things are going wrong.  There was a time when two steelworks here, we had engineering, we used to make things. Not any more. We canapost let China produce everything. We want aposcan doapos politicians who get things done -Labour had good ideas, people would vote for them. His next door neighbour on the historic town wall, William Crask, , a dad-of-two and production operator, had the same message.

I am a working man, and the fact is that they donapost represent me anymore. They are for public servants, the middle class, people on benefits. Butyou are a working class person, in a normal job, they just donapost seem to care. I did not vote Labour last time when I had before, because I was for Brexit.  But it is not just about that, they donapost talk about investment, they donapost seem to have any policies, they donapost have a vision. Boris makes mistakes but he is just himself, and people donapost seem too worried about his faults.I voted for Tony Blair Labour went wrong with Ed instead of David Miliband.It was all downhill from there. The Labour party is trying to please everybody, and pleasing nobody.  Brexit is done, gone, and we need to move on from that. We need jobs, investment, not just all mouth and no action. Actions speak louder than words. In her victory speech, Jill Mortimer warned Labour had taken local people for granted for too longapos. Many agreed with that view, and spoke of the work of Tees mayor Ben Houchen in bringing investment to the area. Elizabeth Maughan, , a mum-of-three who works in a local newsagent, did not vote for Labour this time because she was so aposdisillusionedapos.  We have so much anti-social behaviour where we live, people smashing windows, and I am working and paying full council tax, she said. I have always voted Labour - my mother would be turning in her grave - but they have not done anything for Hartlepool. I could not vote Tory mind. Outside the Pot House pub, a popular spot with beautul views out over the town harbour, there were many who had turned Tory, however. Frank Boagey, , a retired steel erector who paid his union dues during a -year career, turned his back on Labour for the first time in  after lelong support.  All my family were fishermen, there was no way I was going to vote against Brexit, he said. This is not a dictatorship. The people of Hartlepool voted to leave the EU and Labour would not go with the majority view, which is what you do in a democracy. Mandelson was an embarrassment for me and so were the last two Labour MPs. If you had given Peter Mandelson a pin, he could not have found Hartlepool on the map before he came here and now he is Lord Mandelson of Hartlepool, it really is a joke. They kept on dropping people in here who know nothing about the place, taking the voters for granted.  I was a trade unionist for  years and voted Labour for  years and suddenly thought aposwhat have they done for me apos Retired local Government officer Edith Ward, , a great grandmother, was one of the few dissenting voices. But she was not surprised that Labour lost, and urged the party to do more to win back the traditional working class voters. I think people have forgotten all the huge mistakes made at the start of the pandemic, the thousands of lives lost as a result of those mistakes, she said. I voted against Boris. But Labour have got to try harder to win this back, and prove they are better than people think right now.  They do need to make a change. Her friend Ann Murray, , a retired office clerk, great grandmother and former Labour voter, went for a local candidate as she felt more needed to be done aposfor the North eastapos. Independent Sam Lee took her vote and , others, with . percent overall, as Tories took huge gains from the , who voted Brexit last time. Hartlepool-born Christine Appleyard, , on a visit to see her school friend Julie Sladen, , described the result as a aposbloody tragedyapos.

Itaposs thought that the Queen logged on to wish her great-grandson Archie a happy birthday, when he turned two, earlier this week.Since Prince Harry and his American we Meghan Markle made the move across the pond to Calornia, their son, Archie, he has been keeping in touch with members of the royal family via video calls.In the coupleaposs interview with Oprah back in March, Harry revealed that he had spoken to the Queen more in the last year than he had for many, many years. My grandmother and I have a really good relationship. And an understanding. And I have a deep respect for her, he added. Harry reportedly also met privately with the Queen twice when he ed to the UK in April for his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburghaposs funeral. But Archie stayed at home with Meghan, who was too heavily pregnant to travel.  According to the Mail, officials at the palace were left feeling uncomfortable this week because they didnapost have an up-to-date picture of Meghan and Harryaposs son Archie to accompany his birthday messages on social media.Instead they had to use photos from just after he was born or from his official christening. A source said: The truth is the Prince of Wales has barely seen his grandson twice since he was born. In fact every member of Harry’s family can easily count on one hand the number of times they saw Archie after he was born and before the family left the UK. It’s a very sad situation. The source reportedly stressed that no one is directly to blame for the lack of family connections. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sensationally quit the royal family last year and moved first to Vancouver Island on Canadaaposs west coast and then to Los Angeles, where they now reside. The pandemic has meant that they have been unable to make social visits toto the UK although Harry was back in Windsor briefly for his grandfatheraposs funeral. Which is why the Queen and other family members have mostly had to make do with video calls.

The siblings became seriously ill in May  which their parents believe may have occurred after a walk in the Scottish Highlands, reports the Daily Record.  The family, from Elgin, Moray, relocated to Glasgow where the boys were treated at the Royal Hospital for Children- one of only two childrenaposs kidney transplant centres in the UK able to maintain a full schedule of renal transplants throughout the pandemic.Samuel made a recovery after being treated with dialysis. But Leo was in hospital for more than two months before being moved onto three times weekly kidney dialysis in August and medics knew he would need a renal transplant. Mum Louise was a perfect match and the transplant took place on February . It was an awful time for our family as it came on so suddenly.  Thankfully Samuel recovered relatively quickly, but Leo went from being a typical happy, healthy boy, who played in the garden with his brother and attended school, to being completely hospital-bound and unable to fully engage with normal le. But his bravery and optimism through this has been inspiring. I was naturally over the moon when we found I was a match, and despite the pandemic, from then on everything in the transplant work up process seemed to go like clock-work. Leo will always have kidney disease, and Samuel and myself will have follow up for some time to come. We know there will be bumps in the road ahead, but to look back six months, to compare where we are now itaposs a miracle really. Leo now has his le back and weaposll be counting the small milestones - going back to school, going swimming and maybe even a holiday - as victories and we will never take any of these happy family moments for granted in future.  Dr Ben Reynolds, consultant paediatric nephrologist at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, who leads the transplant service, said: It is fantastic to see Leo recovering well and full of energy again, full of eight- year-old mischief and silliness. At RHC weaposre lucky to be one of only two childrenaposs kidney transplant centres in the UK able to maintain a full schedule of renal transplants throughout the pandemic. This is so important for children like Leo where there is a well matched donor, and the operation means we can get them off dialysis and back to as normal a le, as quickly as possible.

Around a third of people with coronavirus show no symptoms, so can infect others without even knowing they’ve been ill. Rapid testing is a vital tool to make sure people know when to self isolate so they break the chain of transmission. Alex, , from Hemel Hempstead, works for JamVans, a removal company that provides Covid- tests for its employees. He was experiencing no symptoms at all when he tested positive for Covid. “We move people’s homes on a daily basis, and also have a delivery contract with a local hospice – it has about  charity stores, and we help them move all the stock,” says Alex. “One morning before work I did a rapid Covid- test outside the hospice, then sat in my van waiting for the results. I’d done a few of these tests, and thought it would be fine as I didn’t have a single symptom – but then the test came back positive.”  “I spoke to the hospice on the phone from outside the building, and they told me I had to go for a PCR test. My company booked me in with a private firm and I went straight there. Our company policy is that we have to wear a mask in people’s houses and throughout our offices, and I stick to the guidelines as much as I can, so at first I thought the rapid flow test must be wrong. But within an hour, I was told I definitely had Covid. I couldn’t quite believe it.” Alex was able to isolate straightaway, ensuring he wasn’t spreading Covid to any vulnerable people he came into contact with. “I stopped working to self-isolate on full pay, and still didn’t develop any symptoms at all,” he says. “Without the test, I definitely would have carried on working, which is why it’s so important to have regular tests, evenyou haven’t got any symptoms. I had the virus and I felt fine, but imagineI’d given it to my parents, my grandparents or my colleagues  “If I’m driving between  charity shops, with three or four people in each shop, I could have been quite a spreader. I would have put a lot of people at risk, who may not be as young and healthy as I am – you never know who you’re passing it on to. It might sound dramatic, but in my case, taking the test could have saved lives. I haven’t had the jab yet, but I will as soon as I can – and I’ll still be taking two tests a week.Get into the testing habit More than half the adults in the UK have had at least one dose of Covid vaccination and lockdown restrictions are beginning to ease. But the virus is still out there and around a third of all the people who are infected do not show any symptoms. Regular rapid testing is vital to break the chain of transmission – now all adults are advised to do two tests a week. Rapid testing kits are free and you can do them at home, with results appearing within just  minutes. If you test positive, you’ll be able to isolate straightaway rather than risk spreading Covid to others. Millions of people have already made regular home testing part of their routine, as secondary school children and their parents have been able get free tests since February, but now everyone is encouraged to play their part. Every test helps to put your mind at rest and helps protect people around you as the country moves out of lockdown. Around one in three people with coronavirus has no symptoms. Rapid Covid-tests are for people who aren’t showing symptoms. If you’re showing symptoms , order a PCR test. Test twice a week, or every three or four days: it’s the best way to catch a case of Covid- at the point it becomes highly infectious.If you test positive you should self-isolate immediately and visit nhs.uk get-tested or call  to order a PCR test that will confirm the result.If you test negative, you must still follow the Hands, Face, Space and Fresh Air rules to minimise the spread of Covid-. Rapid tests are easy to use and give results within  minutes. It’s important to report your results online straightaway, whether the test is positive, negative or even void. It’s easy to do at gov.uk report-covid-result or by calling .More than m rapid tests have been taken since October , and hundreds of thousands of positive cases among people with no symptoms have been picked up. Information from the rapid tests is kept anonymous, and scientists use it to spot patterns and outbreaks more quickly and accurately, helping to reduce the risk of future lockdowns. Even though you might have already had one or two doses of vaccine, there’s a chance you could still give Covid to someone , as no vaccine is  per cent effective. So it’s vital to test twice weekly as well as continuing to follow social distancing guidance, washing hands, wearing a face covering and letting fresh air in. Rapid Covid- tests are suitableyou have no symptoms of Covid .“Remember, around a third of people with coronavirus have no symptoms, but could be spreading it to others without knowing,” says GP Dr Amir Khan. “Rapid testing is effective at detecting people who are infectious and enabling us to find Covid- cases that we otherwise would not know about. This helps us in our efforts to stop the spread of the virus. Testing regularly even when you have no symptoms means we can keep infection levels low and our country safe, and the good thing is they give a result within  minutes.” And, as Dr Khan notes, the tests are very reliableyou do them correctly. “Testing ourselves for coronavirus using rapid Covid- tests is vital in keeping ourselves and others safe from coronavirus and keeping infection rates in our communities low. When done correctly, the tests are at least . per cent specic, which means the risk of  positives is extremely low – less than one in a thousand. This means it is a very good test.”‘All I had was a mild sore throat’ Kim Tobin, from Southend, Essex, works in a supermarket and had a positive Covid- test in January  Routine rapid testing in the workplace helped Kim, , discover she had Covid, even though she was showing no symptoms. Without the test, she could have spread it to her workmates and customers.“I had a very, very mild sore throat, just a little scratch and that was it,” she says. “I didn’t even think anything of it. I was all dressed for work, ready to go.

Russell Adey, , and we Kate, , were regulars at their local hostelry and visited with friends several times a week. But after nearly a year of lockdowns, they were missing their regular drinking hole and wanted a project to focus on to distract from mental health struggles. They decided to create a traditional pub in their garden which they have dubbed the Adey Arms. Russell pulled up part of the lawn at the bottom of their garden and laid slabs ready for a structure to be erected.What do you think  Have your say in comments belowThey then purchased a £, summer house, which they liken to a big shed, and it was delivered and put up in mid-March this year. The couple from Stourbridge, West Midlands, then painted the exterior and flooring, before insulating and plaster-boarding the walls. A local electrician install the electrics before the couple started the decorating process, hanging wallpaper and sourcing second-hand furniture.The bar, table, benches and log burner were made by a local carpenter, and the couple found the fridges, beer pumps and soft furnishings on eBay and Facebook Marketplace.No pub would be complete without its own merchandise, so they also ordered a sign for the door and personalised beer mats - all emblazoned with aposThe Adey Armsapos.  For extra fun, they added a projector and big screen for movie nights and football matches. The family-friendly garden pub has a table area for their children, Archie, , and nine-year-old Tilly. In total the couple spent £, and the pub was finished in mid-April, taking just four weeks to complete. We soon started missing the pub when lockdown started, and with home-schooling the kids my we was desperate for one, Russell, who works as a sales manager, said. Me and Kate were really suffering with our mental health during lockdown and decided we needed a project of some sort to focus our energies on, that would be fun to do and could be a lasting reminder of how important our friends and family are to us. The fact we werenapost able to see them all had really hit home to us, so we decided to build our own pub. Once the idea was in place, Kate started a mood board and they got to work designing the whole thing. Russell said: We were adamant that we wanted to buy local and source everything from local businesses, or recycle by buying second-hand things - which would keep the cost down as well. Businesses had suffered so much with the pandemic so we wanted to give something back and try and do our bit for the local community. Once completed, the pub was spacious enough to have three separate seating areas - tall stools, a corner table to seat six and a miniature table and stools for the kids. The family opted for classic pub decor, with exposed brick wallpaper, wooden finishes and even traditional features including stuffed animal heads.  In a fun twist, they also framed a picture of the Queen covered in tattoos. After finishing installing and decorating the pub, the family were inseparable from their new watering hole. Russell said: The bar was finished in mid-April and we have been in it ever since.We have a coffee machine and soft drinks so weaposre not always drinking alcohol.Now we have the pub I canapost see us going back to our old haunt. The drinks are cheaper and we now have everything we need at the bottom of the garden, so thereaposs no need to go anywhere . We also donapost need a designated driver anymore as we can just stumble up to the house. Our family absolutely love it in there - it saved us during lockdown at a time where there didnapost seem to be anything to look forward to. We are so proud of it and what it represents.

OaposTooles Cafe in Earlsdon, Coventry, is a popular spot in the city, famed for their Irish breakfasts and freshly baked goods. Opened in , the cafe displays the Irish flag and Irish flag bunting above their seating area. But on the morning of May , they received an anonymous typed note that said: How long are the IRA banners going to be there The Westwood Road venue posted about the incident on its Facebook page and was immediately inundated with support from disgusted locals, all voicing their support, reports Coventry Live.Writing on their Facebook page on Thursday May , owner Isobell Adams wrote: Firstly, please excuse what could be a long post. I received this through the post today, to say I am shocked is an understatement. I thought this nonsense was long behind us as a society. I have no IRA banners in my cafe. I have bunting that denotes the tricolour, the flag of Ireland. I have the Irish flag painted on my sign, that is all. I won’t give this any more credence. We have tried so hard to integrate with a fantastic community and we have been warmly received. This is so sad.Speaking to CoventryLive the day after the incident, owner Isobell Adams said: It came in with the ordinary post, itaposs hard to say, itaposs just quite unsettling really, when you look at it from face value itaposs all a bit silly, butyou feel this deeply, a why because I donapost have any paramilitary regalia and b how far are you prepared to take it  What might you do next  She added: I put the post up because I was so saddened by the whole thing, we have been so accepted by the whole Earlsdon community, and tried to show weaposre not just here for our benefit, weaposre here to be part of the community and do anything we can, so it all just felt a bit horrible, is the only word.OaposTooles opened in November , and like many in the hospitality industry, have faced an uphill battle to stay open during the pandemic.  Explaining the history behind the cafe, she explained OaposTooles is her motheraposs maiden name, and a nod to her family in County Mayo, who were known for their baking. Itaposs nothing fancy, just good Irish home cooking, and thataposs all this is for, a little nod to my mum, my Aunty Celia, a nod to them thataposs all it is, we make our own potato cakes, soda bread.Ms Adams said since the incident, the cafe has been busier than ever, with Earlsdon locals popping in with flowers and well wishes to show their support.The support from this community has been, I donapost even know how to put it into words, it really is humbling, I put the post up because I felt it ought to be shared, and I knew that the community were behind us, but to this degree  Theyaposve just been absolutely overwhelming, and itaposs just so so lovely. As far as Iaposm concerned that was yesterday, with the support weaposve got from the community Iaposm not going to dwell on someoneaposs negativity.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy notice Prince William and Kate Middleton have learned lessons from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as they really push towards being the future king and queenapos, a royal expert has said.Commentator Duncan Larcombe said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have embarked on a rebranding as they look to ensure the survival of the Firm in the modern world.Earlier this week they changed the name of their @KensingtonRoyal Instagram page to the more informal @DukeandDuchessofCambridge, while adding a photo of themselves smiling.It follows the pair launching a YouTube channel and releasing a family video to mark their -year wedding anniversary on April . The couple also released a  second compilation video meeting royal fans. It begins with William pointing at the camera and saying: Be careful what you say now, because these guys are here filming everything. Kate laughs and says I know as the footage kicks in.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  “I honestly think they have embarked on a rebranding in the light of what effectively the importance of personality as well as position for the royals, Mr Larcombe told the Sun. “Harry and Meghan have shown that modern royalty will only surviveit is absolutely at the cutting edge of social media that their profiles play into the narrative of the cult of the celebrity. “William has decided now is really the time to really push them as a couple as well as the future king and queen.”  Since stepping back as senior royals, Harry and Meghan have often outshone other members of the family when it comes to news coverage.In order to bag multi-million pound deals with the likes of Netflix and Spoty, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have had to ramp up building a brand separate to the Firm itself in the last year. It comes after fellow royal commentator Daniela Elser said Kate had actually upstaged sister-in-law Meghan by nailing the social media game.  She said the Duchess was winning a royal power play thataposs set to change the crown forever, while the world is distracted by the Harry and Meghan Show. Writing for news.au, she said a case in point was an Easter video she posted.Rather than the obvious imagery associated with the time of year, the Cambridges instead went with a cheeky video of a chocolate egg being smashed in reverse.  The commentator added that Kateaposs skills as an amateur photographer have also helped in the coupleaposs social media transformation. Last weekend, the couple released a photo of daughter Princess Charlotte, taken by her mum in Norfolk, to mark her sixth birthday. And last July they did the same for first born Prince George when he turned seven.

While some people were disappointed that they couldnapost gather outside the hospital or see the traditional photos, the couple still included well-wishers by arranging a photocall at Windsor Castle and new dad Harry gave a spontaneous interview. But there was one aspect they legally had to share with the world - Archieaposs birth certicate. The document, like all birth certicates, was a matter of public record, regardless of your royal status. It revealed for the first time where Archie was born, the Portland Hospital, and also showed an interesting detail about Meghan - her official job title. The document lists her role as Princess of the United Kingdom. It left many fans scratching their heads, wondering why it said princess when Meghanaposs official title is Duchess. While she was given the title the Duchess of Sussex by the Queen on her wedding day, she is also technically a princess, just not in her own name. She is Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Wales through her husband, Harry. The Duchess of Cambridge also listed princess under the job section part of the form on Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louisaposs birth certicates.  However there was further confusion around Archieaposs birth certicate in January when it emerged that Meghan and Harry changed it months after officially registering his birth. The couple removed Rachel Meghan from the aposmotheraposs nameapos section, leaving simple the Duchess of Sussex.Days after the changes were made, Harry and Meghan walked away from the Fab Four’s joint charity and had quit the Royal family within months.Some experts claimed it could be seen as a snub to Prince William and Kate, who have her name on George, Charlotte and Archieaposs unorm, however this was quickly rubbished by the couple.

Thomas Cook said last night it had taken more bookings for trips to Portugal in one hour than in the whole of last month. The firmaposs head of PR David Child said jet-setters appeared posed, ready and waiting to go as Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the relaxing of restrictions at the Downing Street briefing.Mr Child told Sky News Portuguese hoteliers are desperate for custom and so room prices are not yet raising prices, evenairlines might bump up flight costs. Have your travel plans been affected by the pandemic  Let us know at webnews@mirrorGary Piazzon, founder of portertravel, praised the announcement, describing Portugal as the real winner here.Speaking to the Sun soon after the briefing, he said: “Data reveals that in the last hour, Google searches for ‘Holidays to Portugal’ have skyrocketed, up ,% when compared with ten minutes before the Transport Secretary’s announcement.Mr Piazzon said that searches for fellow green listers Israel and Gibraltar were also up ,% and %, respectively. “I agree with Grant Shapps in that travellers are crucial to rebuilding the UK economy and I really hope this is the all-important light at the end of the tunnel we’ve been waiting for, he added.It comes as Ryanair added extra flights to Portugal, with , seats to the likes of the Algarve, Lisbon and Porto for the summer holidays. Other countries to make the cut were Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, Iceland and the Faroe Islands, and several small remote islands that are British Overseas Territories.However, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei and the Faroe Islands wonapost actually be accepting British arrivals. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are yet to announce their international travel plans. As expected, Spain, France, Italy, Greece and the US were all left off the initial green list and given amber ratings meaning travellers will have to isolate on theirhome. Travel industry bosses have slammed the move as too cautious and detrimental to struggling tourism companies hit hard by the border closure. Critics have called for the Greek islands, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands to be added to the green list.

The fact the Prince of Wales has seen so little of his fourth grandchild meant royal aides struggled to find a good photo to use as part of Archieaposs nd birthday message earlier this week, it is claimed.According to the Mail officials at the palace were left feeling uncomfortable because they didnapost have an up-to-date picture of Meghan and Harryaposs son Archie to accompany the posts.Instead they had to use photos from just after he was born or from his official christening. The paper even claims that Archie may have just met his Cambridge cousins - Prince George, seven, Princess Charlotte, six, and three-year-old Prince Loius - just the once. A source said: The truth is the Prince of Wales has barely seen his grandson twice since he was born. In fact every member of Harry’s family can easily count on one hand the number of times they saw Archie after he was born and before the family left the UK. It’s a very sad situation. The source reportedly stressed that no one is directly to blame for the lack of family connections. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sensationally quit the royal family last year and moved first to Vancouver Island on Canadaaposs west coast and then to Los Angeles, where they now reside. The pandemic has meant that they have been unable to make social visits toto the UK although Harry was back in Windsor briefly for his grandfatheraposs funeral.

He said they didnapost need convincing, it was merely a conversation.Mr Evans told Variety at the concert taping on Sunday night at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calornia. “They were so excited. They said, ‘We believe in the importance of vaccine equity.’For them, it was an easy decision to do the right thing because they were so passionate already. He said when he spoke to Meghan she suggested calling on he private sector to rally and for US businesses to step up, and so they got to work. “They’ve approached it with such sincerity and such leadership. I’ve been extremely impressed with their amazing commitment to the cause, Mr Evans said. Prince Harry received a rapturous response as he took to the stage of a vaccine fundraising concert in the US - but without his pregnant we Meghan. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had both been set to join famous names from the worlds of music, film and politics at the Vax Live event in Calornia. But while Harry made his first public appearance since the funeral of his grandfather Prince Philip to address the crowd, his partner did not join him in person.He was given a standing ovation by the crowd, before giving a speech praising the selfless efforts of front line workers during the pandemic. Speaking to an animated crowd of only fully-vaccinated guests, the duke asked for vaccines to be distributed to everyone everywhere, while also saluting frontline medical workers both at the concert and around the world.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have called on Covid vaccine manufacturers to act with responsibility and leadership and increase their allocation of doses distributed to poorer parts of the world. Harry and Meghan have written an open letter to the chief executives of pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca urging them to redouble their support for the UN-sponsored Covax programme. The couple have called on all firms to temporarily suspend intellectual property rights applied to Covid vaccines, and for a global public-private collaboration so production methods for the jabs can be shared. The Sussexesapos intervention into the global debate about the vaccine rollout comes on the second birthday of their son Archie, and separately they have asked those wanting to mark this to donate funds which will support Covax.  Harry and Meghan, writing in their roles as Vax Live campaign chairs, said: As of May , over % of the . billion vaccine doses administered globally have occurred in high and upper-middle-income countries while the very lowest income countries have administered just .%. As we are seeing in countries like India, the urgency to deliver doses now to save lives and stop the spread of Covid- is only increasing. Thataposs why it is imperative that we ensure equitable vaccine access globally so that people are protected, economies can recover, and this global pandemic can be brought to an end everywhere. Therefore we, the undersigned, stand with global citizens who want to see Covid- vaccine manufacturers act with extraordinary purpose, responsibility, and leadership in response to this equity crisis.  Harry and Meghanaposs letter is available for the public to sign on the website of the anti-poverty movement Global Citizen, and it calls on Moderna to move up your delivery schedule with Covax and increase the promised  volume to at least  million doses. It also urges Pfizer BioNTech to commit at least  million additional doses to Covax at a not-for-profit price and to deliver them as soon as possible this year. Covax was set up last year to try to establish fair access to the vaccines for poor and rich nations, but huge discrepancies have emerged. It has been reported that more than  million doses have been delivered through the system but more than £ billion is still needed to ensure most adults are immunised.  While the British Government is among the biggest donors to Covax, it has come under criticism for slashing the aid budget to . per cent of gross national income, despite the Conservative manesto pledging to keep it at . per cent. Marie Rumsby, UK country director for Global Citizen, said: The work of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the Vax Live campaign demonstrates how urgent the need is to act now and ensure everyone, everywhere has access to Covid- vaccines.

The incident at the Ilford Islamic Centre happened this week, while the Muslim community continues to observe the holy month of Ramadan - which ends next week. Local politicians have condemned the incident as a “disgraceful act of hatred and violence” that has “no place” in the community. The politan Police said it received a report of racially aggravated criminal damage at around pm on Tuesday evening at a mosque in Albert Road, Ilford. The Federation of Redbridge Muslim Organisations tweeted that eggs and other items had been thrown at worshippers and that five people were hit, but none seriously injured. The Met said that so far there have been no arrests. Ahmed Nawaz, director and secretary of the centre, said the incident was “a shame” but the community remained strong. He told PA: “I was caught by surprise because leading up to this we had a very quiet and peaceful -odd nights, and then this happened. “We weren’t expecting it this kind of time in the period of reflection for everyone, having gone through Covid.” He added: “It’s a shamewe’re used to it. “We’re a strong community and we take it on the chin. It makes us weary rather than fearful.”  Mr Nawaz said police and local authorities had been “very supportive” following the incident but that attacks against the Muslim community were often “glossed over” in the media. “We just want to be treated like humans, just like everyone ,” he said. Sam Tarry, Labour MP for Ilford South, said: “I am shocked and saddened to hear of this Islamophobic attack against Ilford Mosque. “These disgraceful acts of violence and hatred have no place in Ilford, and I hope that the perpetrators face justice as soon as possible.” Jas Athwal, Labour leader of Redbridge Council, said the council would continue to work closely with police and that security in areas surrounding the mosque would be increased. “Racist incidents like this have no place in our borough and we will work with our friends and neighbours at Albert Road Mosque, and the police to ensure the safety of all worshippers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum 15 delivers baby number","story":"NewsMum-of- delivers baby number  - and they all have names beginning with CEXCLUSIVE: Patty Hernandez, , from Charlotte, North Carolina, has given all her children names beginning with C in honour of her husband Carlos, although she was struggling to think up a new one before the birth of her latest sonmirrorShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPatty Hernandez posing with her husband Carlos and their huge brood \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

She recently explained how passengers could get themselves free drinks and air miles when they travel and is now back with another clip. This time, sheaposs shared the reason why you rarely see flight attendants going through security with you. Kat explained: Have you ever been in the airport and you thought aposwhereaposs all the flight attendants and the pilots  Why are they not going through security apos Iaposm gonna tell you where we actually go. So, at most major airports, we have something thataposs known as K.C.M. or Known Crew Member and what this is, is when weaposre hired we get an extensive background check on us, we get our fingerprints done, itaposs a whole entire process. So we can actually go through a secret little door, show our badge, show our Known Crew Member, it gets scanned and we just walk right through, we donapost have to do security.

When Snow Queen Elsa flees Arendelle after accidentally plunging the kingdom into internal winter, her sister Anna sets out on a mission to try and find her and break the icy spell. Anna enrols the help of mountaineer Kristoff and his reindeer sidekick Sven, who appear to have the perfect friendship that started when they were infant and calve, developing an unbreakable bond. But one Frozen fan has a theory that the beginnings of their relationship wasnapost all the rainbows and butterflies it might seem - and it could change the way you watch the film forever. Posting on Reddit, they said: Iaposm probably slow but have only just noticed that in Frozen, Kristoffaposs coat is made from fur. Andyou look closer at the pics the fur part seems to be reindeer. I donapost think it can be wolf cos the pelt is too big. That makes it a bit awkward, though, that Kristoffaposs best friend is a reindeer and heaposs actually wearing his skin. But in the context of the story, it all fits together. The ice harvesters must have killed Svenaposs mother, leaving a baby Sven for Kristoff to look after, and giving him the pelt to wear. This explains why Sven is so close to Kristoff too, and why Kristoff still wears the same pelt. The smell reminds Sven of his mum. Yep, the theory is that Kristoff is wearing the skin of Svenaposs murdered mother.

Although its rare for humans to be killed by the venom the animal uses to paralyse and kill prey, the sting can cause shocking welts on exposed skin, leaving victims in excruciating pain for days afterwards.The post was replied to by Mndiaye_, who shares informative videos about nature, and warned others not to copy what they had seen, saying: This is why women live longer than men, s*** like this.That is not a jellyfish, itaposs a Portuguese Man Oapos War, also known as the bluebottle, also known as the floating terror.  Itaposs a species of siphonophore armed with millions of explosive stinging cells powerful enough to make Nemo an orphan and occasionally turn a person into past tense. This Man Oapos War is responsible for up to , stings a year in Australia alone and the venom can cause excruciating pain for up to three days, leaving a nasty, whip-like welt as a souvenir. But honestly, youaposre luckythataposs all you get because the venom can trigger an allergic-like reaction that results in throat-swelling, heart issues and dficulty breathing, as you suffocate, possibly to death.

Halma Cisse, from Mali in West Africa, had struggled under the six stone weight of her unborn nonuplets and amniotic fluid prior to going into labour. But during her caesarean section, medics battled to save her after the -year-old suffered a haemorrhage of her uterine artery. An army of  nurses put the newborn babies into incubators while a radiologist fought to stem the blood flow. The premature children are still on ventilators and must remain in specialist care for another  weeks before they can breathe without support. Halma had been flown to Morocco for specialist medical care before giving birth just seven months into her pregnancy. Now doctors are working around the clock to care for the premature nonuplets.  They donapost have digestive tracts which can absorb food, Youssef Alaoui, medical director at the Ain Borja clinic, told The Times.A small infection in a premature baby can kill in a few hours. Halmaaposs husband Kader Arby said the babies are gts from God.The -year-old soldier told the Daily Mail he canapost wait to meet his children.I have been in constant touch with my we, but I had to stay at our home in Mali to look after our other little daughter, who is just two years and five months. Travel is of course dficult because of the pandemic, but we are arranging a trip for next week.  It will be a very joyful, and we will be thanking God the whole time. The happy couple married during a three-day celebration in December  in Timbuktu. The President of Mali himself Bah Ndaw is among those to have offered congratulations with a phone call. Askednames had been chosen for the five girls and four boys, Kader laughed and said: We will see!  Initially, doctors thought Halma was carrying seven babies which quickly caught the fascination of her home country. President Ndaw ordered she be sent to Morocco in March as she needed specialist care. The mum-to-be was in a hospital in Maliaposs capital, Bamako, before being transferred to Morocco on March , her husband explained. She then gave birth on Tuesday at the Ain Borja clinic in Casablanca five weeks into her stay.

I wouldn#t imagine there would be many clubs that have come out of the Championship and achieved that.“But we don#t believe the story is done yet and we#ll, hopefully, go to Hampden and get a positive result.”It#s not just the United boss who is up for the fight: his players are, too.Forget the carrot of European football, forget about the presence of Scotland boss Steve Clarke, all that should matter to the Terrors is cup glory.For Mellon, there is no need to motivate his troops, with the prize of kissing silver all the incentive they need.He continued: “Someone asked me after the last game: ‘Do you think you will be able to motivate the players for next weekend ’“I couldn’t believe that. I thought it was a bizarre question.mdash Dundee United FCMay , “It is probably the opposite – you are trying to make sure they hit the right levels and certainly they are under no illusions that going down to Glasgow they are going into a massive game.“You just have to get them focused on what the game is, play the game and make sure you do your jobs and only do that, don’t get affected by things you can’t control.“I am a football fanatic. I am delighted that I am involved in such a massive game.“That is what I enjoy doing and what I have been able to do all throughout my career. I am so pleased I will be able to do it up in Scotland.”Mellon, who spent the vast majority of his playing and coaching career down south, is relishing leading his team out at the national stadium.Admittedly, he#ll be looking for a performance more akin to the - quarter-final success up at Aberdeen than last weekend#s - league defeat to Ross County at Tannadice.For the Scot, however, all that goes in the bin with what is at stake and he says United are looking forward to #a really exciting afternoon# on hallowed turf.“There’s so much at stake and it’s a one-off so it’ll be massively dferent,# Mellon added.“It’s at the national stadium and the pitch will be like a big bowling green.“The pitch at Tannadice is very dficult, to be honest.“I’m not making excuses because it’s the same for both teams and you have to adjust and adapt.“The pitch at Hampden is fantastic at the minute so that’ll be good and, of course, it’s a semi-final with so much at stake against a Hibs team we know a lot about.“It makes for a really exciting afternoon.“Of course, there’ll be no crowd there which is unique but we look forward to taking on the challenges that come along with that and, hopefully, we’ll get a positive result.”Third-placed Hibs go into the showdown as the bookies# favourites, largely, due to their being six spots and  points ahead of United in the Premiership standings.It makes no odds to Mellon, though, who is only focused on ensuring his Tangerines perform in the club#s biggest game in many a year.“Underdogs are always decided by other people and I can’t effect that,# he said.“What I’ll tell you is we’ll go there and we’ll be expecting to try to be the best version of ourselves and perform.“We believe thatwe do that we’ll give ourselves a great chance of getting through to an unbelievable final.“We’ll go and attack that the best way we can.It was Hampden heartache in  but Calum Butcher is determined things will be dferent this time as Dundee United set sights on Scottish Cup Final\" title\"#It was Hampden heartache in  but Calum Butcher is determined things will be dferent this time as Dundee United set sights on Scottish Cup Final# #

The goalkeeper was virtually an unknown but came in and he was immense, particularly in the shoot-out at the end.“I remember having a shot from about - yards that was going in the bottom corner but, again, he got there.“I was thinking: ‘This goalkeeper’s actually better than what we’ve gave him credit for’.“That was the biggest frustration on our part.”The Hibees would go on to win it all # ending a -year wait to get their hands on the old trophy, with unorthodox Irish goalkeeper Logan the hero after saving two United penalties in the last-four shoot-out.After their  Scottish Cup Final loss to St Johnstone, for Rankin and the Terrors it was more heartache that would soon turn to misery with Premiership relegation a few short weeks later.“I had five years there and I absolutely loved it,# the former Hibs man continued.“I’m sorry it ended the way it did.#Thankfully for Ranks, though, United are back on their feet after five years in the wilderness, coming full circle as they take on Hibs as a Premiership outfit in a last-four clash at Hampden on Saturday.Recalling the build-up to that same meeting five years ago # the match ended - after extra time with the Hibees winning - on penalties # the former Tangerines midfielder is methodical.“I remember we had come from behind up at Ross County, I think we were down to nine men that day, to set up a semi-final against Hibs,# Rankin said.“I always remember coming off at County having broken two or three ribs and going to the hospital the night after thinking: ‘I need to be fit for the semi’.#I was desperate to play.“The game came around pretty quickly andMixutried something dferent – I think he had Callum Morris at left-back. | William Hill Scottish Cup\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed S-bzdCokYg featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen“The biggest surprise that day was Simon Murray not being on the bench. Those two things always stick out in my head as to why it didn’t go well.“We got an absolute doing for the first - minutes but we managed to stay in the game, Mixu made an early substitution with Callum going off and Paul Dixon coming on.“The game changed really quickly and we started to get a foothold.“When Jason Cummings took that penalty and missed it trying to chip the goalkeeper, I went round all our players and tried to fire them up because I thought it was disrespectful.“It was such a big game for both us and them. I’d played for Hibs before and I knew their history of not winning the Scottish for a long time so I know how big a moment that was.“I tried to rally the troops from then on in and, at half-time, myself and Pateswere both speaking, Mixu had a go and at that point we realised we’re in a Scottish Cup semi-final.“It was a break from the league so let’s go and try to play.“In the second half, we had a couple of opportunities through Billy Mckay and Henri Anier to try to get a goal but it went to extra time.“At that point, I can always remember Hibs had a tough schedule and they actually looked knackered.“They’d lost a League Cup Final to Ross County, were pushing in the Championship and I remember looking at Paul Hanlon and John McGinn and they looked like they had nothing left in the tank.“The longer the game went on I thought: ‘There’s only going to be one winner here’.“We looked fitter and stronger but, credit to those guys because they managed to dig out the result that day.#Relegation to the Championship, where United would remain for four years until promotion last term, signalled an end to Rankin#s time in tangerine, clocking  appearances from -.Although he looks back with fondness, Ranks admits, having come close on a few occasions, not picking up a winners medal at Tannadice is still sore.He added: “The Scottish Cup Final in  was probably the hardest one to take because the run we’d been on – Kilmarnock, St Mirren, Inverness, Rangers – they’re all top teams, even with Rangers out of the Prem at the time.“To get to the final and not win was hard.“We beat them in the first game between us that season but St Johnstone knew exactly what we were doing, our strengths and weaknesses, and we never managed to get out of second gear.“It was disappointing but, fair play, they scored just before half time and it took the wind out of our sails.“It was the quietest dressing-room I’d ever been in at half time that day.“We were looking for something, a spark, and I think Nadirhit the post, Ryan Dow hit the post, but it didn’t happen.“Everything that probably could’ve went wrong did.“I was really disappointed not to win something in my time at Tannadice.”Safe in the top flight under Micky Mellon and headed into the biggest game the club#s faced since his day, Rankin is delighted to see United #back where they belong#.And, although it won#t make up for all his near-misses in tangerine, the former favourite sees a team keen to create better memories.“When the club went down, it was a hard time,# Rankin recalled.“There was a clear out and they tried to persevere with the two or three managers that came in.“Robbiegains promotion and it’s good to see them back in the Premiership where they belong.“It’s just a case now of challenging for major honours like United did when I was there.“We played in two cup finals, lost a few semis, too. They’re always there or thereabouts and it’s good to see them challenging again.#Lawrence Shankland v Kevin Nisbet: How the Dundee United striker can re-ignite Euro  bid with Scottish Cup win over Hibs rival\" title\"#Lawrence Shankland v Kevin Nisbet: How the Dundee United striker can re-ignite Euro  bid with Scottish Cup win over Hibs rival# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lawrence-shankland-v-kevin-nisbet-how-the-dundee-united-striker-can-re-ignite-euro--bid-with-scottish-cup-win-over-hibs-rival embed # secretxTaWpegET\" data-secret\"xTaWpegET\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He continued: “I’ve seen Hibs a few times this season and they’ve been great, they’ve got pace in the wide areas.“ Boyle’s a massive threat for them and they’ve got the two strikersas well that bounce off one another.“Having seen United recently, I think they’re concentrating on the cup because they’ve got nothing to play for in the league. It’s too tight to call.#Hibs have been in this position before. They were in the semi-final the last time against Hearts, lost that, and lost to St Johnstone in the League Cup as well.“It’s their third semi-final of the season and I’m sure they’ll be very hungry to put things right but it’ll all come down to who manages it better on the day.“United were phenomenal at Aberdeen a couple of weeks ago.

paused vote-counting to protect the #welfare of staff# after the process in the Aberdeenshire East seat was hit by delays.Theof time it took to count the closely-contested Banffshire and Buchan Coast had a knock-on effect on the count, and officials took the decision to pause it for the welfare of staff, who had been working for  hours.Ballot papers will be stored securely overnight in secured ballot boxes under the protection of security staff.The counting process will begin again tomorrow morning at am at P#J Live.Aberdeenshire ing officer Jim Savege said every precaution had been taken to keep the votes secure.“We have made good progress with the constituency and the list for Banffshire and Buchan Coast, and that took us a bit longer than we thought it would,” he said.“We have also

Union Street, after the demolition of the market building was signed off last year.The plans – including axe lanes, mini golf, curling, shuffleboard, pool, table tennis and marble tables, and smart darts # is aimed at tying in with the wider leisure complex in the BHS building, and expected to open soon.Next door, Flip Out will include a ,sq ft assault course, ,sq ft inflatable system, laser tag and a five-a-side football pitch.The nationwide firm gained permission to set up on levels one, three and four of the site previously. This latest permission means level two is also now part of the scheme.Formerly a flagship store for the British Home Stores, the building closed in April .The C-listed property, in the Union Street conservation area, has since sat empty, gaining the attention of vandals.But now the owners plan to sell up, and it is anticipatedthe council makes a bid shortly, it is unlikely these plans will come to fruition.Under the administration#s plans, which would be incorporated in the £ million city-centre master plan revamp, it is hoped the redevelopment would “enliven” Hadden Street, Market Street and the Green, with the new development acting as a link between the city’s main thoroughfare and Union Square.Plans would likely include pedestrianisation of Union Street, with councillors also being asked to sign off on an initial redesign of the area.Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said “there would not really be much point” in the redevelopment while leaving the Granite Mile as it is.The council’s chief corporate landlord officer, Stephen Booth, said the city was now at a “crucial” point, requiring “signicant change” towards permanent solutions to traffic, favouring pedestrians and public transport.He said the central section of Union Streetshould be a proud destination in the city centre, with Union Terrace Gardens to the west and Aberdeen Market and former BHS to the east.He said it was a #focal point# in the heart of the city centre, linking major retail and pedestrian connections and the gardens which are currently being redeveloped.For as little as £. a month you can

which is running throughout May.Any golfer of any playing standard is able to participate by donating £ then playing a full round at a course of their choosing from anywhere in the world.The Archie Foundation funds key roles and projects at Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital, Highland Children’s Unit in Inverness and Tayside Children’s Unit in Dundee.It also supports Friends of the Neonatal Unit in Aberdeen and Grampian Child Bereavement Network.Locke, , made headlines when he took the silver medal at the  Open Championship, recognising him as the best-scoring amateur, and turned professional after.He recently became the second player to win two Tartan Pro Tour events following victory at the Barassie Links Classic.He said: “I’m excited to support this great cause.”A number of north and north-east golf clubs have also announced their support for the cause, including Deeside, Dufftown, Fortrose and Rosemarkie, Inverallochy, Kintore, Muir Of Ord, Peterculter, Newburgh, Strathlene and Cullen Links.Earlier this week The Archie Foundation announced trustee Carol Munro had become its new chairwoman.She described the last  months as the charity’s “toughest year” so far, with the

golf course and some clubs, then you can play your part in helping to raise vital funding for children and their families in one of the hospitals we support.“We know how generous and supportive the golfing community can be.“We received tremendous support from golfers and golf clubs in last year’s event and we’d love to build on that success this time around.”For as little as £. a month you can

daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland. The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board. The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day. This figure shows all tests carried out, regardless of the result.In October, Public Health Scotland released testing data at a regional level. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board area. The first vaccinations were administered in early December.

An R-value of three would mean the average person with Covid- would go on to infect another three people. As Covid- death recording is so complex, a more reliable measure is excess deaths. Excess deaths are the dference between the total recorded deaths by all causes and the average of the previous five years. The chart below shows this for the UK constituent countries.

everyone.”Those seven words from Aberdeen first team coach Allan Russell were aimed not just at the players who are out of contract at the end of the season, but also at the four players who have spent the second half of the campaign on loan at the club.Gary Woods is the only one of the quartet at Pittodrie who will be a free agent in the summer and manager Stephen Glass has wasted little time in making his mind up on the goalkeeper with Woods signing a pre-contract agreement to make his move to Aberdeen permanent in the summer.Woods was perhaps the easiest decision to make when it comes to the four loan players at the club and his two-year deal represents a good piece of business for both parties.The former Ross County goalkeeper was persona non grata at the Latics after his club released a statement in September stating both the goalkeeper and team-mate David Wheater were no longer part of the first team squad, but it turned ugly, quickly.The club statement continued: “Due to matters that neither party is in a position to disclose, the decision has been made to ensure the football club can now focus on the season ahead.”Woods and Wheater are represented by the same sports agency and they were quick to respond on their clients’ behalf with a strong statement of their own.It read: “When players sign a contract they are fully committed to honouring that contract with the club and be professional  per cent of the time and train and play to the best of their abilities.“Inthey expect the management of the club to also honour the contract, be paid on time and to act with a high standard of professionalism.“Unfortunately we believe that Oldham’s management, in releasing the club statement, is designed to put unfair, undue pressure on two experienced professional players to break a contract which was signed in good faith.”Former Dons boss Derek McInnes offered Woods a leline when he brought him to Aberdeen on loan in October and the deal was extended in January when Tomas Cerny, the number two at the club, was forced to retire due to injury.Wheater was not so lucky, having to wait until March before agreeing a termination of his deal with the club.But, having stepped into the breach following a rib injury to Dons captain Joe Lewis recently, Woods has taken his chance to show what he can do with some accomplished displays as of late.Undoubtedly he has taken his chance and has earned a permanent deal after showing he can be a safe pair of hands when called upon.Callum Hendry has also worked hard to make a positive impression and he has been the most productive of the three loan forwards who arrived on deadline day in February.The son of former Scotland captain Colin, Hendry fell out of the first team picture at St Johnstone in late September and arrived at Pittodrie in February with two goals to his name for Saints this season, the last of which came in a - win against Motherwell in the Betfred Cup in November.The -year-old has had to fight for his place at Pittodrie too, but of the three loan players he leads the way with three goals since his arrival from McDiarmid Park.With  months remaining on his deal with the Perth club, it is unclear whether he will have a future with the League Cup finalists, but whatever happens he can be pleased with his efforts from his time in the Granite City.Elsewhere, there is no doubting Florian Kamberi’s ability. He was involved in both goals in last week’s - win at Livingston, but remains something of an enigmatic figure and he does appear to lack the consistency to go with his talent.His goal against Livingston in the Scottish Cup win last month is his only one since moving to Pittodrie on February  and, with two years remaining on his contract with St Gallen, Dons boss Glass will have to decide whether he has done enough to earn an extended stay.With Aberdeen in need of a regular goalscorer to follow in the footsteps of Sam Cosgrove and Adam Rooney, he needs to be certain Kamberi fits the bill.Finally, there is Fraser Hornby.Injuries have prevented from showing what he is capable of during his loan from Stade de Reims.Viewed as a long-term project by his club in France, the Scotland under- international is under contract with his club until the summer of  after they paid Everton £. million for his services last summer.He has yet to get off the mark at Pittodrie and seems likely toto France in the summer.Stephen Glass did not bring any of the quartet to Pittodrie, but he will have the final say on whether any of them can be part of his future plans.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"family echoes of the mcnabs of argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  # one of a family of three brothers and four sisters # and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves # like so many other families # caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons # Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action  and John, , missing in action  # during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimagineable.

Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever.

Thursday night is shinty night in Lochgilphead, with the club holding primary school age coaching from pm to pm and combined men#s and women#s training from pm to .pm.The practicalities of travelling to away matches under Covid rules do, however, give cause for concern. #We can#t use a minibus as things stand and will have to use inidual cars for a -strong squad,# said Angus.#With seven players under  years of age in the squad, we will have to rely on the support of parents.#Kilmory has been placed in the Mowi South A regional league alongside Bute, Lochside, Taynuilt, Ballachulish and Inveraray second team.#There is tough competition in the league,# said Angus, #so with the number of young players we have it will be a case of getting the best team we can on the pitch every week, learning against good opposition and building for the future.#Inveraray#s first team will compete in Mowi Senior League C with Aberdour, Glasgow Mid Argyll, Kyles Athletic, Oban Camanachd and Oban Celtic.Inveraray players were non-contact training twice a week as soon as the rules allowed and club chairman Andrew McMurdo is pleased with their attitude. #I didn#t know what to expect, but the boys have been great and conscientious about the way they go about it. And socially it#s been good for them,# he said.#Both first and second teams are in challenging leagues, but it#s a good challenge.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Most notably, throughout the pandemic, I have been supporting constituents and businesses with COVID- related matters such as sourcing financial help and dealing with concerns over vaccinations.I have delivered real results for the Borders. I campaigned for the poundm Borderlands funding for a Bordersrsquo Railway extension feasibility study, supported the successful re-instatement of Reston station and called for a fund to fix the crumbling roads. On the rural front, I put pressure on the SNP Government for more funding for agriculture and pushed for more resources to tackle rural crime and fly-tipping.As the Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People, I worked with the Scottish Conservative strategy team, to formulate new policies to support older people and matters relating to Social Security Portfolio, such as narrowing the disability employment gap and improving digital inclusion.Looking ahead to the election I will campaign hard for local issues. When it comes to our fantastic NHS, I want a focus on reducing waiting times, improving mental health services and protecting local GP surgeries.As we emerge from the COVID pandemic, we must attract high quality, well-paid jobs to the Borders and improve infrastructure and digital connectivity to bolster the rural economy.On education, I support a national tutoring programme to help pupils catch up, more rural teachers and free school breakfasts and lunches to all primary school children.My campaign, alongside Doddie Weir OBE, continues on automatic access for people living with MND to receive a Blue Badge. Moreover, I have urged the Scottish Government to provide free dyslexia tests for adults to improve social mobility  opportunities.I continue to strongly oppose a second independence referendum and believe we can build back better with the strength of the United Kingdom.Barbra Harvie Barbra Harvie, Scottish GreensThe Scottish Green Party candidate for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, Barbra Harvie, is a semi-retired lecturer in Ecology, Environment and Countryside who lives in Selkirk.She says: \"Our isolated rural communities and small urban environments in South of Scotland have come together with resilience, determination and care to tackle the enormous challenge of COVID- but we are also facing a global climate emergency that can no longer be ignored.\"Scotland needs a Green recovery from the global pandemic that also confronts the global climate emergency.

Before politics I worked in the third sector as a fundraising assistant for Marie Curie, and then for international oil company National Oilwell Varco Mission Products handling customs and logistics. I now work part time as Office Manager for a member of the Scottish Parliament and as a Communications Manager for an MP. I decided to stand in the General Election in  in Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk because I was tired of the constitutional wrangling and wanted to bring the focus back to making a dference locally and further afield. Now, we need to put recovery from the pandemic first. From supporting tourism and local business to tackling the climate emergency, delivering a better education system, supporting the NHS, bettering mental health provision, and making the case for a truly federal UK, I will always stand up for the disadvantaged and will make fairness and tackling inequality central to everything I want to achieve. I want to remove the barriers to opportunity which face rural areas more than others. Everyone should have the chance of living the le they want and to be as successful as possible. During the last year the curtains have been pulled back on where the help is most needed and we need to have a needle sharp focus on getting help to all those in that position. Ultimately, I want to tackle to the root of inequality which is poverty, and keep the climate crisis at the top of everyonersquos agenda. We know our country is wracked by constitutional ision and inequality so now our representatives need to focus on healing and serving communities to the best of their ability at a time when it has never mattered more.

Indeed, I spent years at an Edinburgh healthcare technology company, collaborating with universities and NHS Scotland on articial intelligence software for cancer screening and diagnosis of stroke.Throughout this pandemic we have seen the power of our countryrsquos science base. Despite bumps in the road, the roll-out of testing and multiple vaccines has been impressive.But the pandemic tells another story too ndash of warnings ignored and preparations left unmade. We could and should have had a better plan for one of the highest-ranked known public health risks. We must learn from this collective failure.Scientists have warned for decades that the world is heading towards climate breakdown. They also now speak of a ldquonature emergency ndash an era of mass extinctions caused by humans. Yet greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere relentlessly rise and our forests and oceans continue in dangerous decline. Nowadays, I see scientists practically weeping as they watch this unravelling accelerate, with no believable action plan from politicians.The Scottish Greens recognise that technology will play a huge part in stepping us back from the brink. Our co-leader Lorna Slater is a renewable energy engineer, and our proposed poundbn Green Recovery investment programme will fund thousands of high-quality, unionised Scottish jobs in renewables. But letrsquos not kid ourselves. Itrsquos mostly not technology we lack, itrsquos political will.The Greens will invest massively in warm homes ndash upgrading insulation and converting to low-carbon heating systems. We have bold plans to improve rail, bus and active travel, and already won free bus travel for under-s from this summer. Finally, we propose an urgent programme to repair nature, dramatically accelerating the positive steps already taken by rural businesses, workers and charities.These solutions are not high-tech, not ldquosexy and may not generate huge profits for international investors and a rich elite. But theyrsquore effective, labour-intensive, local, and fair.This election is our chance to tackle the climate emergency, to build a green recovery, and to secure our future as an independent European country.

He has lived in the Scottish Borders for  years.Vanguard Party champions the Union and Brexit. The UK, four nations in union, will prosper as an independent country, outwith the EU. If Scotland were to leave the Union and join the EU, it would not be an independent country. It would be a rule-taker from Brussels. There would be a hard border with the rest of the UK. Scottish exports to the rest of the UK are currently worth three times those to the EU. Funding via the Barnett formula would end. Scots would lose British citizenship.Vanguard Party believes Scotlands future should be decided by the people, not the courts. However, independence is not practical without the support of a simple majorityof the registered electorate, not merely a simple majority of valid votes. IndyRef must require a simple majority of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland, for the whole of Scotland to leave. In  only  per cent of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland voted for independence.Vanguard Party will preserve the distinction between sex and gender. It will protect womens rights to same-sex spaces. It will oppose self-identication. It will oppose any denial of biological truth.Vanguard Party will champion children of disadvantaged backgrounds by providing help and support to raise attainment. It will not promote quotas and targets that may excuse lower attainment.Vanguard Party will champion the NHS. It will recognise the true worth of all NHS staff. It will tackle hospital waiting lists and support GPs to resume face-to-face appointments for all.Vanguard Party will abolish hate crime including incitement of hatred in peoples minds. It will require crimes to be based on evidence, tested objectively, not on subjective perceptions of victims or others.Vanguard Party will champion traditional values and culture.

Most important was keeping in touch with you through my surgeries: in supermarkets, libraries, and my annual summer surgery tour through the villages. This past year of course has changed everything. We have all been stuck at home keeping in touch through emails. COVID has dominated and I have tried to help you with the problems it brought in its wake. Moving now through vaccination, queries arise as you await that appointment. At the same time other issues continue: unsuitable housing, planning concerns. This is the essential work and duty of an MSP to constituents no matter what their politics. I hope I have discharged that duty. I have also chaired the parliamentrsquos cross-party group on animal welfare for many years with two Bills to my name: The Control of DogsAct , now law, putting the blame on the owner not the dog and The Welfare of DogsBill which aims to end casual purchase of puppies. COVID prevented it proceeding butelected I intend to bring it back, especially with concern that some of those \"COVID\" puppies will end up in animal rescue centres. Yes, how le has changed, COVID has been hard: losing a business built over years, living with children trapped in a flat, not attending a funeral, delaying the wedding, the new baby not socialising with family. The list is endless of the sacrices, the losses. COVID has broken the link with the way we were, just as those World Wars changed society. Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated true leadership and moving to recovery it must not be back to the same old, same old but to a socially just society, valuing people from cradle to grave, our public services, rejoining the EU as an independent nation. On May , I ask for your constituency vote on my record as your MSP and the list vote for the SNP, giving you and Scotland a democratic choice to move forward as a renewed nation.Shona Haslam Shona Haslam, Scottish ConservativesOn Thursday, May , voters are faced with a choice. Rebuild our communities after the pandemic by improving our childrenrsquos education, delivering record funding to our NHS and enhancing employment opportunities, or, once again, reopen the question of Scotlandrsquos place within the United Kingdom.Make no mistake: the next few weeks will see one of the most important elections of our letime.Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated recently that she only cares about one thing, an independence referendum that most Scots do not want but one that she will still foist upon them anyway. The past year has been tough for us all. Many of us have struggled with the pressures of lockdown, myself included. But the way to recover from this pandemic is not to launch into another constitutional argument that threatens our livelihoods, our childrenrsquos futures and our way of le.As a mum to two lovely boys, I want to see a government that puts aside its own agenda and commits to focusing on whatrsquos best for the next generation of Scots. ldquoJudge me on my record said Nicola Sturgeon on education. Well, the attainment gap remains as large as it ever was, and Scotlandrsquos education system has plummeted in international rankings. It would seem the First Minister has been found wanting.Itrsquos not just our schools that under threat other public services are too. As leader of the Scottish Borders Council, I have fought tirelessly against repeated cuts to our budget, forcing councillors to make dficult choices simply because the Scottish Government finds it easier to pass the buck. After the strain of COVID, we need a Scottish Government that will step up, empower councils and work with them, not against them.Butthe SNP gain enough seats to form a majority in May then all that is at risk. Once again, they will push for another isive referendum.There is only one way to stop that: lend me your constituency vote, and the Scottish Conservatives your party vote, on May .ACMay AC May, Scottish Liberal DemocratsI intend to represent you the only way I know how - by working tirelessly with a keen eye on the future to ensure that there is investment and improvement in education, employment opportunities and business growth. I will stand up for better funded healthcare and demand that money is directed towards care homes, mental health and wellbeing to bring these up to the standards we all deserve. To do this will need a strong economy and the Scottish Liberal Democrats are putting recovery first ndash this must be Scotlandrsquos priority. A vote for me is a vote of confidence for a more secure future for you and your families.Its time for a change. The area needs someone who will heed the concerns of constituents, and voice these strongly in parliament, not just another person sitting in Holyrood applauding every word of the First Minister.Prior to the boundary changes, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had a long record of success here, and its high-time for ato rational, clear thinking on the issues that matter locally and nationally.Our high streets and town centres ndash the beating heart of our communities ndash need urgent help. This was apparent before the pandemic, but even more so now. Online commerce can bring tremendous benefits and is here to stay. Many businesses have transformed to the new normal, but many others have struggled. We need to focus on how growing online spend can coexist with a vibrant local economy, and work to restore community feeling.Im looking forward to getting stuck into the campaign. By their own admission, a ided Tory party has mishandled Brexit, driving Scottish voters in desperation towards nationalism, while the opportunist and populist SNP seeks to compound the disaster of Brexit by withdrawing from the UK completely, just at the point when we need economic recovery the most.A vote for me is a vote for progress through strong partnerships within Scotland, across the UK and with our European neighbours, so that together we can recover from the COVID crisis and move beyond the politics of ision.Katherine Sangster Katherine Sangster, Scottish LabourCOVID-rsquos impact on our families, our communities and our economy has been profound. We now need to start the hard work of rebuilding our country and that task needs new faces, fresh ideas and experience outside of Holyrood.I am a working parent who prior to  had never been involved in politics. However, I like many other parents soon realised that the SNPrsquos childcare policies sound good on the back of an election leaflet but donrsquot work in practice. So, in , I campaigned for fairer access to childcare and led Fair Funding for our Kids - a nationwide campaign that got childcare on to the national agenda, building a movement of mums that demanded action from Government. Our campaign secured more funded childcare from Government - a step towards equality, but there is still plenty to be done.Soon, I was speaking on television, writing for newspapers and lobbying politicians. All things I has never done before but I was speaking from the heart and articulating mine and othersrsquo experience. Now with five years plus experience in politics I still firmly believe that policy is best made by those with lived experience and the job of a politician is to listen and advocate on peoples behalf, and I will always put that at the heart of what I do.Working for an MP now, every day I support people with the issues that blight their lives from poor housing to an inhumane benefits system to bins not getting picked up. These are issues that affect people day in day out. Chatting to voters and speaking to constituents, I have experienced no appetite for debate on a second referendum just a desire from people that we as politicians and aspiring politicians listen to their concerns and respond to those concerns.We need to elect MSPs to Holyrood who understand these concerns and will fully use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to make peoplersquos lives better. Holyrood is one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world lets start using those powers. As Donald Dewar said at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in  ldquoA Scottish Parliament, not an end but a means to greater ends.On May  please use your vote carefully and letrsquos start the

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience.

The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious.

It seems very unfair that we should no longer be able to use a road that we pay for to access the hills.I noticed a picture on Facebook, taken on a sunny Sunday when people would normally be out enjoying a walk around the reservoir, but only one car seems to be using the car park.As East Lothian grows, we should be utilising as much of our outdoor space as possible to help our population exercise and take pressure off coastlines and popular woodland areas. The Lammermuir Hills are underused for recreation and have a superb network of paths, but woefully inadequate parking.Overriding everything in the letter you printed is the Scottish Governments Land Reform Act of , which clearly states the Right for Responsible Access in Scotland.. The overall framework of land rights, responsibilities and public policies should promote, fulfil and respect relevant human rights in relation to land, contribute to public interest and wellbeing, and balance public and private interests. The framework should support sustainable economic development, protect and enhance the environment, help achieve social justice and build a fairer society.. There should be a more erse pattern of land ownership and tenure, with more opportunities for citizens to own, lease and have access to land.The landownerrsquos decision to heavily restrict parking prejudices families, those with disabilities and groups who take people walking in the hills and need an access point. I understand that during the last year, the countryside has suffered littering, fires and irresponsible parking, but to punish responsible visitors because of the behaviour of a minority is a knee-jerk reaction and will only create animosity towards the estate at a time when public opinion is turning against grouse shooting. Instead, the landowner should be working with local residents, East Lothian Council and interested parties to help improve access and educate visitors on how to visit responsibly.Name and address supplied"},{"url":null,"title":"builders-merchant-built-instead-hotel-former-raceland-site","story":"The former Raceland karting site, between Gladsmuir and Longniddry, closed in early .Work is due to start later this year on a petrol station, two drive-thru restaurants and a drive-thru cafe on the southern section of the site.Initial proposals suggested a hotel could be built on the northern part of the former karting site, where the outdoor track was located, but that could now be ditched for a buildersrsquo merchants.The karting centre was given planning permission in  and also operated a paintball centre.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":null,"title":"lloyd-cole-madness-eighties-pop-week-radio","story":"Madness had the juicier material ndash Two-Tone, Nazis, playing on the roof of Buckingham Palace.

As the industry underwent a long overdue shake-up in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, Coffey found herself at the heart of that revolution.It remains a timely issue. The entertainment world has been rocked again in recent weeks with allegations of sexual harassment and bullying against the actor and producer Noel Clarke. He has denied any sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing.Intimacy coordinator is a role still in its infancy. The first time anyone was formally credited with this job title was when Alicia Rodis, a stunt performer and actor, was hired to work on The Deuce in . The HBO series centred on the rise of the s porn industry in New York City.Coffey talks frankly about how it works. When a scene requires sexual activity or nudity, she is tasked with helping to choreograph it in much the same way as a dance or fight sequence. Her remit not only covers simulated sex scenes but all aspects of intimacy and physical proximity.ldquoWhen I go into a room, I talk with the director first to find out what they want the scene to look and feel like, whether that is on set or on stage, says Coffey.Vanessa Coffey works as a TV, film and theatre intimacy coordinatorldquoI usually have a separate phone call with each actor to talk about their boundaries and any places they are not OK to be touched. Also,there is nudity that is required, what their limitations are, so we are clear when we go into the rehearsal room what we can and canrsquot do.ldquoOnce I am clear on all of that and also on what the director wants the scene to look like, we can have a good conversation about what the choreography of the piece should be and exactly where peoplersquos hands should be going.\"If it is a scene with simulated sex, we will talk about things like how many thrusts we think are needed and the nature of that thrusting. Is it a quickie  Are we talking about something that is long and passionate This expertise is much in demand.

Only at that point, where they are comfortable with the physical actions, would I then ask them to put the characterrsquos intention behind it.:The Scots writer behind star-studded thriller The Rig being filmed in EdinburghIf a scene relates to an assault, rather than a consensual encounter between the characters, this will often, says Coffey, necessitate additional conversations to establish the boundaries and assess any psychological impact on the cast members.ldquoEven in circumstances where we might not have a simulated sex scene and there may not be nudity, the very suggestion of the fact it is a sexual assault might be triggering for somebody, she says.ldquoWe need to know that and have an honest conversation because sometimes,that is what is needed for the role, it might not be the right role for that person at this time in their le.There is an extra level of care required when working with a younger cast, says Coffey, some of whom might be shooting their first intimate scenes on-screen. ldquoYoung actors are very keen to say yes to things, she says. ldquoThat is when I am on the lookout for a lsquoyesrsquo that is really a lsquomaybersquo or a lsquoprobably notrsquo.While shooting I Hate Suzie, Coffey had to coordinate Billie Piper in what became the longest solo sex scene in TV history . It was a complicated sequence that at one point, quite literally, involved herding cats across the set.Coffey is there to observe proceedings and flag any concerns should the choreography of an intimate scene not play out as discussed oran actor is looking uncomfortable. Does she ask for filming to be stopped ldquoYes, sometimes that will happen, she says. ldquoI am always in the room on the closed set. Unless it is impossible for me to be in the space, for example,we are shooting in a storeroom and there is only enough space for two people and the camera.ldquoThen, I am immediately outside that door so that,somebody calls my name, I can be there instantly.Intimacy coordinator Vanessa Coffey. Picture: Wolf MarlohldquoIf we are doing a simulated sex scene and there is nudity, we have modesty garments or barriers that have been put in place to fit between the actors. Sometimes those things move. The cast need to be able to call out to say: lsquoThis has shtedrsquo.Having an intimacy coordinator maintaining a constant presence means that,any such issues do occur, these can be swtly dealt with.ldquoI work closely with the costume department making sure that the modesty garments are in place, says Coffey. ldquoChoreographically, we might need to change somethingthings keep slipping orit is not working for some reason.ldquoI am usually standing next to the director, so we can have eye contact with one another. I can see whether the performers are comfortable or whether something maybe looks right on the screen whereas, in reality, I am seeing something a little bit dferent.ldquoIf there is a disconnect, I will say, lsquoCan we cut rsquo Then I need to go in and have a quick word or give feedback between takes.Coffey consulted on The Panopticon for the National Theatre of Scotland in . Written by Jenni Fagan, the play covers powerful themes, centring on a -year-old girl who has spent her le in the social work system.When overseeing a scene depicting sexual violence, Coffey quickly realised the actors playing perpetrators equally needed her support.ldquoThe people who were committing the sexual assault had just as much of an issue with the scene as the person on whom it was being committed, she recalls.ldquoBecause, of course, the actors are having to put themselves in a place where their character is doing something to somebody  that they would never consider doing in their own lives.:Chapel of the heart: How Orkneys wartime past inspired a new novelShe devised an aftercare programme to address this. ldquoWhen dealing with scenes of trauma, I suggest ways that people can de-role and get out of the space safely for the day, says Coffey.ldquoThey have activities and that might be as simple as running and touching things of a certain colour in the room, such as three things that are green. It brings you back to the space you are in rather than mentally keeping you in that traumatic territory.When Coffey started out as an intimacy coordinator, she did wondersome might see her role as the ldquoPC police.

What never-ending emergency ndash surely a contradiction in terms  ndash is graver than a le deprived of love and human contact Yet many people have not even blinked at this unprecedented government intrusion in their lives.

JOANNA BLYTHMAN:We must never accept another lockdownThe nearer we get to liberation dates in June, the more reluctant the powers-that-be are to liberate us.Johnsonrsquos thuggish lieutenant Dominic Raab and a series of power-puffed academics are assiduously seeding the thought that some restrictions will have to stay in place over the summer.Covid has unleashed the tyrant in government and academia. James Naismith, another professor-dictator, says: ldquoI think wersquoll re-impose mask wearing in the winter in crowded indoor spaces.

This established public health formula was akin to the ldquofocused protection approach advocated by the medics and scientists who signed the Great Barrington Declaration, which challenges lockdowns.On the other hand, China, a full-on Communist, authoritarian, one-party state, imposed stringent lockdowns, rigorously monitoring compliance through systematic surveillance of every aspect of its citizens lives.This Chinese model inspired the High Priesthood of Modellers.

But this experience has distorted our perception of risk. We now must correct it.If a healthy -year-old woman has the misfortune to be infected with Covid, she has a .% chance of surviving thatrsquos less than the fatality risk for a general anaesthetic.A -year-old man with co-morbidities ndash other serious conditions ndash has a .% survival chance thatrsquos less than the risk of a person in that age group dying of any cause.A healthy -year-old woman has a .% chance of surviving thatrsquos less than the risk of being injured in a car accident.Even an -year-old man with co-morbidities has a .% chance of surviving thatrsquos better odds than living in a care home for a year.The overall infection fatality rate from Covid in Western countries is held to be .%, or lower.

The average age of those killed by Covid in the UK is . years old, which is older than the average Scottish le expectancy.Covid deaths have slumped to single figures.

We all do.His opponent, Labourrsquos half-Portuguese Hong Kong-born Jackie Baillie, has lived in the constituency for decades.Her treacly voice mixes traces of Scottish with long gliding vowels, English diphthongs, which tell a story of a peripatetic youth.:Uzma Mir: Why cant Scots, in Scotland, use Scots words, without being called jakeys This election has been a festival not just of democracy, but of language. Big political campaigns always are. Because during them broadcasters are forced out in to communities, pushing microphones and cameras under our noses and asking us to talk. And talk we do. In our own voices, and sometimes, our own dialects and languages. The result ndash as we hear from Argyll fishermen, Polish migrants, Mearns farmers, Edinburgh bankers or Lanarkshire call centre workers ndash is a chorus of erse, wonderful accents.And not just in English. This campaign, for the first time, has seen all foreign nationals living in Scotland getting the vote. That has quietly inspired a linguistic revolution. Candidates are asking people to vote for them in other languages.Aside from Mr Giuglianorsquos Italian video, SNP politicians alone have prepared clips in German, French, Spanish and Chinese. Closer to home, the Tories ndash some of whose more chauvinistic base can be hostile to indigenous languages ndash have made a party political broadcast in Gaelic.Accents: sometimes they reflect who we are, where we have been sometimes they signpost who we want to be where we want to go. But they always say as much about us as our words, whether we like it or not. They map us, vocally.They can also provoke surprisingly strong emotional responses, both positive and negative. Some of us struggle to hide our prejudice when we hear the cut-glass RP of Tory frontbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg or the working-class Glaswegian of SNP MP Mhairi Black. Both have been abused over how they speak. Polar opposites politically, they have, it is said, found common ground on this prejudice.Toni GiuglianoPoliticians, even the less able ones, are usually too savvy to indulge in what socio-linguists call ldquoaccentismrsquo, bigotry based on speech. There is not much to be gained, after all, by insulting voters, unless you are aiming for a very small demographic.The last weekend of this yearrsquos campaign, however, featured exactly this kind of election clanger. George Galloway, a Kremlin TV host and de-facto leader of a fringe British nationalist electoral slate, took to Twitter to askthe mission of BBC Scotland was to ldquomake us look and sound like a nation of Janey Godley and Rab C Nesbits before adding the he was ldquowatching jakeys.Ms Godley is a writer, comedian and an online columnist for The Herald. She has been subjected to sustained online harassment for several years, often from political unionists, some of whom now support Mr Galloway.She speaks English with a pretty routine Glasgow accent and occasionally drts in to a broader Scots. She was eloquent enough to fight her own corner, mocking the hapless, gaffe-prone Mr Galloway. He responded by publishing faked tweets ly accusing Ms Godley of being a racist. He had to apologise. There was only one loser in this Twitter spat.:Stuart Waiton: Scots university suspends lecturer as sop to woke warriorsThe ugly little episode was hardly illuminating for those who follow politics. But for socio-linguists, like Rob Drummond of Manchester politan University, it was ldquofascinating.ldquoGeorge Galloway is embodying some well-worn stereotypes regarding the relationship between accent, identity, social class, and even character, the academic said. ldquoItrsquos an unusual stance to take during elections, as surely it simply serves to alienate signicant sections of the population.ldquoHe is explicitly putting some accents on a higher-status-level than others, and seems to be accusing BBC Scotland of knowingly using this hierarchy to undermine the perception of Scotland from outside. He clearly sees one accent as representing the underclass, and another accent as representing the elite.Politicians may not often punch down. But they sometimes, Mr Drummond says, punch up, referring to ldquoposh\" Etonians. ldquoThis is, of course, still an example of accent prejudice, but arguably it is happening in the direction where the imbalance of power makes it less recognisable as such, he says.He and his colleagues have been cataloguing examples of accentism, as the BBC and other TV and radio channels widen the range of speech they broadcast.They have good news. ldquoThere is still a long way to go, but there are perhaps signs that things are changing, Mr Drummond explains. ldquoThere are suggestions that younger people do not hold the same stereotypes and attitudes towards particular accents as older people. And there is clearly a lot more ersity within broadcasting as a whole than there was  or  years ago. Also, there is simply so much more voice media around than there was [more TV, podcasts, social media, youtube etc]. Hopefully, all this exposure will have an effect.This was a TikTok election, a campaign when soundbites were not just for the evening TV news, and when everybody could have their say ndash out loud, recorded for posterity.There are still those who struggle with linguistic ersity, who think more iety makes less sense, who yearn for the certainty of a prestige dialect or accent, whether it is RP or standard Scottish English . But standardisation means less understanding, not more. It loses us so much nuance, so much identity so much poetry of place. Only speaking SSE or RP is like only painting in monochrome. Itrsquos dull.Later today we will find out who voters in Dumbarton have chosen as their voice, Mr Giugliano or Ms Baillie. Either way it will be somebody whose speech tells a story.

His success in photographing these notoriously shy creatures lies partly in his ability to blend silently into the seascape, becoming indistinguishable from a rock or clump of weed.Yet on a subliminal level, Howard appears to speak the animalsrsquo language. ldquoYou have to think like an otter to succeed in photographing or spending time with them, he says.The Highlands-based naturalist has just published The Secret Le of the Otter: a book filled with astonishingly intimate images of the creatures at rest, at play and at war. Getting close enough to capture them fighting, gambolling and even mating is incredibly rare.Of Howardrsquos three wildle photography books, this is the one hersquos proudest of because it was the hardest to produce. ldquoOtters are elusive in the extreme, he says. ldquoTheir incredible shyness combined with hyper-aware senses and natural camouflage has made them successful survivors.:Line of Duty proves appointment TV is not deadOtters have inhabited Scotlandrsquos lochs, shores and rivers for at least , years, yet their nocturnal habits and wary natures have made them shadowy presences, often accorded magical qualities in myths and legends. At one time, people debated whether they were fish, canines or amphibians: early clerics are said to have argued over whether or not their flesh could be eaten during Lent.And although they were hunted for sport and for their pelts until the practice was banned in , these enigmatic creatures seem always to have been regarded with affection. They were once trained to catch fish or turn fireside spits for their human masters, and there are records of them being tamed like puppies during the th century.Andy Howard treats them with respect rather than amiability and having spent a day on the hills watching him photograph mountain hares, Irsquom struck by his contrasting approach to the two mammals.With hares, he maintains a constant, low chatter as he looks them in the eye and clicks the shutter, sometimes addressing them fondly by name. ldquoWhen photographing hares, you want them to see you, hear you and be aware of you, he says now. ldquoWith otters, you donrsquot want them to know you are there at all.There are no pet names in his new book, in which he describes his relationship with the animals as one of ldquokinship. What does he mean by that  ldquoThe thing I like about spending time with otters is that I have to be as secretive as they are, in a way. I have to be furtive and become part of their environment to succeed with them. So I find myself quite often behaving like an otter.:Northern Ireland at : Growing up in a land of dreams and terrorHe prefers to work on stormy days, when ldquothe wind masks the sound of my shutter, and hersquos not afraid to immerse himself in brine in order to catch the ldquosuper-low, otterrsquos-eye perspective that brings the viewer right into the animalrsquos watery world.Rapt in concentration while photographing a mother and her cubs, he once lost his footing and tumbled backwards off the rocks and into the sea. ldquoI remember looking upwards to see green bubbles racing to the surface, only just managing to struggle ashore.His subjects ndash whose likenesses were obliterated by the salt water ndash seemed unperturbed by the dripping cameraman flailing around trying to retrieve his equipment. That day, Howard appears to have completed his transmogrication into a sea creature.An otter once got close enough to snf his boots another dosed happily in his presence after hersquod spent five or six days quietly observing it while camouflaged among seaweed. ldquoIt had grown to take me as a part of the landscape and would walk past quite nonchalantly within a couple of metres then roll about or curl up and sleep. I actually started talking to it ndash just whispering to see its reaction. It seemed to accept the fact that I was gently talking to it.When I catch up with Andy Howard, Covid- restrictions mean I canrsquot join him in his preferred, Hebridean snapping ground. So this morning, keen to observe an otter in the flesh, I preceded our phone interview with a mini-safari along Glasgowrsquos White Cart.:Celebrating Archie Brennan, innovator, pop artist, adventurer and former Mr ScotlandPrevious generations of Glaswegians would have been unlikely to see otters on rivers flanked by factories, mills and engineering works. Otters prefer clean waters and during the s, over-use of pesticides combined with industrial pollution and other factors drove them out of many British waterways. Some died as a result of toxins in their food chain and their numbers plummeted by %.Since the s, however, the ban on agricultural pesticides such as DDT, along with de-industrialisation and legal protections against culling, have led to a healthy resurgence and there have been several recent sightings along the now decontaminated White Cart.Unfortunately, however, my morning wildle-spotting expedition gleaned nothing but some ducks and an old fox scratching its fleas. Where did I go wrong  ldquoYou didnrsquot go wrong at all, Howard reassures me. ldquoItrsquos the luck of the draw. Otters have a great ability to blend in with their surroundings, whether it be the bank of a river in Glasgow, a peat hag in Shetland or some seaweed on the island of Mull.The fact they often float with just their eyes and nose above water makes them virtually invisible. ldquoWhen they are in the water, especially a river, they almost become liquid themselves, says Howard. ldquoAnd the way they move makes them very dficult to spot unless you have a really well-trained eye.Because they hunt mostly at night, their black, tarry droppingsalong with half-eaten fish, crabs or lobster, are often the only signs of their presence and ldquothe best opportunity to see them is when theyrsquove actually caught something and theyrsquore sitting on a rock or on the foot of a bridge, eating their dinner.Another trick, says the otter-whisperer, is to listen. Having determined that an environment is ldquoottery, hersquoll sometimes drive around with the windows open. ldquoI often hear otter cubs before I actually see them, he explains. ldquoTheyrsquore quite vocal.:Teddy Jamieson: Do we really need a Festival of Brexit Can he describe the noise they make  ldquoIrsquom not good at impressions, he laughs, ldquobut itrsquos a very high-pitched whistle thatrsquos designed to cut through the air. The natural sounds surrounding otters are quite low-frequency ndash waves crashing, trees rustling. A cubrsquos high-frequency whistle pierces through all the other sounds, giving the bitch otter a chance to catch up with it or find itthe family becomes separated. They are very good at communicating with each other.Late one evening, Howard was startled by a pitul screeching and followed the sound to discover a distressed mother otter whose cubs were being summarily killed in front of her by a male. Otters are territorial with males guarding a range of up to km. And while females often live together in family groups, dog-otters are solitary, communing with others only to mate.On this occasion, a marauding male had apparently taken over anotherrsquos territory and was ensuring the survival of his own genes. In his book, Howard explains that ldquobeyond her terrible trauma, the bitchrsquos body would respond by ing rapidly into heat, and the dog would be close at hand to impregnate her.Howard got no pictures that day ndash partly because the light was poor but also because of the emotional impact on him. ldquoIrsquod read about it happening but never thought Irsquod be in a position to witness it, he says now. ldquoAnd in a way I felt privileged to have seen such a raw, brutal element of the le of the otter. People that have studied otters for their le and work have never seen that happen.ldquoNature is quite cruel at times, he adds. ldquoItrsquos all part of the process ndash and yes, it was an upsetting thing to witness.Hadnrsquot he been tempted to intervene  ldquoI didnrsquot really know what was going on until it was too late, he says, though in any case, approaching a frenzied otter could be dangerous. For all their cute faces and ldquohumanlike qualities, these are wild animals with strong jaws and teeth designed to crunch through shell and bone. Howard once met the late TV naturalist Terry Nutkins, who in boyhood had lost two fingers to one of Gavin Maxwellrsquos otters while working as his assistant in the western Highlands.Maxwell did much to popularise the image of the otter as a cuddlesome, furry friend. In his bestselling  book, Ring of Bright Water, he described sharing his home, his bath and even his bed with the creatures. ldquoIrsquom not sure that sits comfortably with me, says Howard. ldquoMuch as I appreciate Gavin Maxwellrsquos writing, Irsquom not an advocate of people removing animals from the wild and keeping them as pets.In fact, the photographer takes the opposite approach, interfering as little as possible with the animalsrsquo natural habitat and presenting readers with a privileged insight into a world in which the human presence has ostensibly been obliterated.Most of the Secret Le images were captured around sea lochs and he often visits a location several times before taking any pictures. ldquoThat way you get to know the animalsrsquo inidual characteristics:they fish at low tide, high tide, where they like to sleep. It means I can be in position, waiting for the otter to come in.Howard conducts wildle photography tours and his top tip for clients is to be patient. ldquoThe more time you invest, the bigger the reward. With otters especially, the moment often comes towards the end of the time you allocate to spend with them. If I just bide my time, it should reward me in the long term and usually that does happen. Otter karma is something I teach my clients: donrsquot push itit doesnrsquot happen itrsquos not meant to be. If it is supposed to happen it will happen and therersquos always another day.And when the stars align, clients have sometimes been moved to tears. ldquoItrsquos such an emotional thing, to have a close encounter with an otter, says Howard. ldquoThatrsquos what drives me ndash itrsquos like a drug. Delving into the secret le of an otter is almost voyeuristic.

A Celtic monk living at Lindisfarne during the seventh-century, Cuthbert was reputedly fond of taking nocturnal walks along the seashore. One night, a curious colleague secretly watched as he waded into the sea right up to his neck and began singing psalms. As dawn broke, he ed to shore, whereupon two otters came up and warmed his cold wet feet with their fur. Cuthbert blessed them, and they ed to their holts.Ring of Bright WaterGavin Maxwellrsquos celebrated  memoir describes his le in a remote cottage at ldquoCamusfearna , and the two imported otters he kept there as pets. He sourced his favourite ndash Mij ndash in Iraq and brought him to the UK during an eventful plane journey that saw the creature chewing its way out of its box and running rampage around the cabin. Maxwell fed the animal on bucketloads of collected eels, walked it through the streets in a custom-made harness and allowed it free rein of his London and Scottish homes where it frequently pierced visitorsrsquo ears with its teeth. The story was partially fictionalised in a  film adaptation and for a generation of children, the scene involving Mijrsquos brutal dispatch, at the end of a road-diggerrsquos shovel, was a tearjerker on a par with the shooting of Bambirsquos mother.Tarka the OtterThis  novel by Henry Williamson recounts the le story of an otter cub that becomes separated from its mother and wanders the North Devon countryside alone, until it eventually fathers a family of cubs of its own, before being killed by the local otter hunt.

Given we now know that Covid- vaccines protect against the disease and there is growing evidence that they also reduce transmission, itrsquos not a big leap to suggest that people who have been vaccinated are at less risk, and pose less risk to others. This is where requiring proof of vaccination comes in.Israel and Denmark already have certication schemes to allow access to shared indoor public venues such as restaurants and cinemas on the basis of having received both doses of a Covid- vaccine, proof of an earlier infection or a recent negative test result. Estonia has also developed a digital vaccine certication programme, VaccineGuard, through its national patient portal.:David Pratt: Indias Covid tragedy shows a tale of two pandemicsIn the UK, people are broadly supportive of vaccine passports. In an Ipsos MORI poll conducted at the end of March, over half of those surveyed were in favour of them for a whole iety of activities. Strongest supportwas for international travel and being able to visit a relative in a care home or hospital. There was even support from half of those polled to require them on public transportor to go to the hairdresser .But vaccine certication is fraught with dficulties and is controversial. The Scottish Government has been clear that they have no plans to introduce a domestic scheme anytime soon. We are all still coming to terms with the latest app Checkin Scotland that helps us provide details to NHS Test and Protect when we visit a cafe, pub or other hospitality venue.Uptake of the Protect Scotland apphas been more limited than hoped, with just over . million downloads as of February  in a population of over-s of . million. Younger children aged  and above were eligible to download the app from mid December  but it is unclear how many have done so.What are the main concerns about a vaccine passport scheme  First, we can look at what studies tell us. Last month my colleague Professor John Drury co-authored a rapid review of studies on attitudes and behaviours to Covid- health certication . He and colleagues involved in the review found  studies from a iety of countries, including ten from the UK. Certication of vaccination or antibodies was generally supported for international travel and protecting more vulnerable groups . Public attitudes were more negative in terms of requiring certication for access to education, workplace or religious settings.There was some evidence from the studies that those with certicates might change their behaviour, being less likely to observe social distancing or engage in handwashing. The review also found that requiring people to be vaccinated before providing access to ious activities wouldnrsquot necessarily increase vaccine uptake.Other questions about vaccine passports are practical. At the moment in Scotland we donrsquot routinely receive a card confirming wersquove received our first or second dose even though this is recorded in our NHS records. In England, the NHS appmay soon include a feature to show whether someone has been vaccinated or had a recent Covid- test. We donrsquot yet know how this will be done in Scotland, or indeed what the alternative would be for people without smart phones.:Climate crisis debate in the Holyrood election  Net zeroThere are also ethical considerations, particularly for vaccine status. These focus on inequalities ndash the fact that younger people are not yet eligible for vaccines and that uptake has been lower in more deprived areas and among some ethnic communities. Requiring proof of vaccination could exclude these groups from key aspects of social and economic le.Itrsquos pretty clear, however, that some form of certication is on the cards for international travel. There is already a precedent for this with yellow fever, where proof of vaccination is required for entry to a number of countries in Africa and the Americas. All three of the main European Union institutionshave indicated support for an EU Covid- certicate. This will allow people to travel more freely between EU member states for those who have been vaccinated or have evidence of a recent infection or negative test. Discussions are underway with the World Health Organisation to identythe certicate can be used for travel outside of Europe. It seems likely that the UK will develop something similar as part of proposals to restart non-essential international travel.We will hear much more about this in the coming weeks. Letrsquos hope a system can be developed that is secure, easy to access and takes into account the needs of dferent groups and communities. This could be an important step in terms of more freedom of movement internationally. But vaccine passports for activities other than travel is something we should approach with real caution.Linda Bauld is Chair of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-yes-no-sides-now-thrash-indyref-terms","story":"The last referendum was held using poorly-defined wording on the actual vote, and no clear timetable as to the letime on the decision of that vote one generation is far too loose a definition. All sides in Scotland must sit down and agree on the voting procedures, in particular deciding the percentage of the vote, not just a straight first-past-the-post vote, required to decide the final outcome, and how long should pass before another referendum on independence is to be held.We cannot have a country held to ransom by Westminster with the cloud of uncertainty ever present, this must be decided for once and for all to allow Scotland to progress, either as a part of the UK, or as an independent country.

It is well to remember that at the time of the independence referendum in  the EU opposed Scottish independence and was far from welcoming.The likely possibility of a customs border with England, our biggest trader, in the event of rejoining the EU would be abhorrent to most Scots, independence supporters included. The tears of Brexit are drying and it is time to face up to new realities which an independent Scotland can look forward to without the EU,only the leadership would catch up with events and accept that it is not desirable to go through the problematic negotiations of rejoining when a new promising course lies before us.John Inglis, Corrie, Arran.EUROPE WANTS SCOTLAND BACKGEORGE Renniewould have us believe that it could take  years for Scotland to get back into the EU Dr Kirsty Hughes, European relations expert, is a lot more optimistic. On the myth that Scotland would have to get to the end of the queue to rejoin the EU, Dr Hughes has stated that Scotland is in a strong position and while the EU has a clear technical process, \"Scotlands going to be ahead in that technical process\".The Scottish Centre on European Relations has stated that the EU views the UK as being \"unreliable, unpredictable and untrustworthy\" but that there is \"broad openness to Scotland having a normal accession path to the EU\" as long as that followed a \"legally and constitutionally sound referendum\".Among the member states there is great enthusiasm for Scotland rejoining the EU, expressed by such senior members as Donald Tusk, the former European Council President, and Ursula von der Leyen, EU Commission President, while Hungarian MEP Istvan Ujhelyi received strong support from fellow MEPs when he called for an independent Scotland to be allowed to rejoin the EU in an \"unobstructed and accelerated way\", pointing out that the Brexit situation was not caused by the Scottish people and that their voice must be heard.All the indications are that Europe has left a light on and the door open for Scotland toand take its place alongside the  other independent nations of the European Union.Ruth Marr, Stirling.* IT is interesting that Gordon McCallumhas been able to adjust his company and its customers to continue doing business after Brexit ndash well done.

The only way we will make progress with a constitution is to draft it ourselves.Most countries have constitutions that are closer to lay terms than legal language, allowing their citizens to easily understand their rights. We should have the same and it is for this reason that the charity Constitution for Scotland has been set up and has produced an interactive website at www.constitutionforscotland.scot that allows everyone the chance to shape a model constitution. Mr Morris mentions Dr Elliot Bulmer, who was involved in its early stages.

HUGH: Nuisance calls drive me madThere are the obvious facets. It was the first holiday that I realised we had a bit of money. Not oodles. But a bit.Pater had moved some years before, resisting the allure of being an electrician in Dalmarnock sewage works to being an early and unrecognised source for Mad Men. This owed something to his undoubted eccentricity, but is mostly attributable to his rising success as an advertising executive.We stayed in Pirnmill for most of the school holidays, with dad travelling down on weekends. With the instinct of a clan unused to money, we knew this cost money.It was also the last time the family spent a holiday together. It seems odd but we were heading off in dferent directions even then. With a spell at seminary and then a career in journalism, I never really lived at home again and never joined the rest on holiday, at least en masse.My reminiscence also recovered something slightly odd but utterly irrefutable. The boy of  was not much dferent from the dodderer of . In Pirnmill of , I was plagued by puberty, racked by doubt, immersed in self-talk, and thrummed to a gentle, constant pulse of anxiety. At , it was largely the same, including the battle with puberty.There was, though, an acceptance of these traits that did not quite exist in the past. HUGH: Kelvingrove memoriesThere was, too, a recognition that what consumed me then, sustains me now.Arran then was constantly sunny, or so it seemed. The MacDonald clan revelled in swimming, walking, cycling and fishing. It was like an Enid Blyton novel without the odd events at Smugglersrsquo Cove and stripped of lashings of ginger beer and English exceptionalism.At its core for me were the transistor radio and the book. The small radio was stashed under a pillow and was a faithful companion late into the night and early into the morning. It crackled, misfired and occasionally caught a radio station across the spectrum. My love of music and radio was kindled in these sessions. It lives on, allowing me to drt through restless nights.It was the arrival of the books, though, that fully stirred communal emotion. The MacDonald family consumed books the way the Kardashians use up spouses.A new supplywas delivered by my father each week. We fell on them with the energy of wolves after a six-week fast. We then passed them around in a sort of literary game of speed dating.It was the way I was introduced to F Scott Fitzgerald. The Great Gatsby, presumably brought for mum, was guided into my hands. It was read then. It is read now.I am not a committed re-reader. I believe there are too many great books still to be read and so shirk from revisiting a past delight.:Rosemary Goring: Its not just the squirrels who are coming out of hibernation, we are tooThere are exceptions. Gatsby is one. It is rewarding and infuriating. It offers constant gts on every visit. It retains its intrigue. Most of all, it reminds me of why I read.Of course, there is the pleasure of being immersed in good prose, there is the delight of a visit to another place, there is the comfort of being lost in another world.I realise now that it also takes me back to the boy. It shows me that many things change in the world but beliefs, passions and pleasures can survive the depredations of time. Of course, they are refined or adapted to present circumstances but what carried me then somehow bears me now.This owes something to the physical aspect of a book but more to its spiritual power. It can remind us of a family that has suffered but routine, natural but grievous loss but carries cascades of love that accompany that bond and need no physical proximity to survive.It is why snatches of prose, snippets of music or even a visit to the wee shop at Pirnmill have such power. They remind us of who we each were but also reveal who we are now. Certainly, there has been change.

On Friday morning, as the full extent of Labourrsquos Hartlepool capitulation became apparent, several of Sir Keirrsquos company men were wheeled out to hang it on his predecessor.Anas SarwarldquoWhat chance did we have, they whined, citing Labourrsquos collapse in , but this was a lame excuse. In these local elections Boris Johnson has surfed the waves of euphoria flowing from the successful vaccination roll-out and the end of lockdown. In , working-class communities, swept up by Brexit and resentful of the Labourrsquos elitesrsquo EU obsession began to rebel. Hartlepool confirmed that Labourrsquos Red Wall is now rubble.In Scotland, the collapse of UK Labour is a watershed moment for the partyrsquos leader, Anas Sarwar. In England, the process of surrendering Labour fortresses to the Tories was begun by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. As they were mesmerised by neo-liberalism and corporatism they came to regard communities like Hartlepool and Bolsover as their politically-incorrect uncle Harry: we canrsquot disown them but do we really have to talk to them.Toryism of the most insidious stamp is now embedded in every corner of England and Labour have made gts of their former territories. The Labour elites who betrayed Corbyn no longer speak the same language as the working-class communities they once purported to represent. Itrsquos a language the Tories have now learned.: Theof Project FearEngland is now entirely under the control of an Etonian kleptocracy who have commandeered patriotism, royalty and gunboats to hoodwink working-class communities that they share their values. These poor people, owing to Labourrsquos neglect of them, will learn the harsh truth when the decade of austerity begins and they find themselves once more on the receiving end.Never has England seemed so distant in its culture, instincts and values. That a dissolute and feckless aristocrat, distrusted by his own party, and for whom poundk-a-year and free accommodation is not enough can triumph in Hartlepool tells its own story.Mr Sarwar now has a choice to make which will define his leadership. Does he continue to pledge allegiance to a polity now under the eternal dominion of this class  If he chooses to maintain his glib sufferance of such a state then he will make Labour an utter irrelevance in Scotland. If he chooses to lend his weight to a second independence referendum he brings his party back into the game with a chance of forming the first government of an independent Scotland.English Labourrsquos failure to heed the messages coming from their former strongholds mirrors the experience of the party in Scotland. They had a sense of entitlement that their fortresses in Glasgow, Dundee, Inverclyde and North Lanarkshire would always come through. As their grandees were seduced by the leather and lace of the Westminster bordello they simply abandoned these communities. Rather than stay and fight for them Jack McConnell, George Foulkes, George Robertson and Alistair Darling chose ermine robes and the Palace of Westminsterrsquos comforting teat.Mr Sarwar doesnrsquot need me to tell him that many of his partyrsquos former supporters voted for the SNP on Thursday against all the instincts and traditions of their families. Nicola Sturgeon has expertly deployed a hard Brexit and the gangsterism of Downing Street to keep them. Her promises of seeking a second referendum are now like confetti and last about as long. Scotlandrsquos First Minister merely has to represent something dferent from the corrupt regime that Mr Sarwarrsquos ill-judged Unionism reinforces she doesnrsquot actually have to make dferent happen.If Mr Sarwar maintains his unflinching support for a state destined to be controlled by the hard right for a generation then Labour is finished up here too. In this hersquoll betray those working-class communities who have been locked out of the Holyrood vanity project and its platinum-card lounges since the beginning of devolution.He talks about a Covid recovery parliament, but Hartlepool means that this concept is already out-dated.

One third of the previous team stood down at the election.Read more from Brian Taylor: Parties united by one thing: a desire for voters to just move onSo Ms Sturgeon will have to govern in future without the sagacious counsel of Aileen Campbell, Roseanna Cunningham, Jeane Freeman and Michael Russell.Ms Sturgeon may also take the opportunity to reshape her Cabinetrsquos structure and responsibilities, while preserving gender balance.That Cabinet exodus is matched in the lower Ministerial ranks and on the back benches. In addition, elections tend to generate involuntary departures.

Ms Sturgeon previously promised that there would be a further liberalisation on May , with Scotland generally ing to Level  constraints. If we all obey the rules.As for international travel, the UK Government has now set out its thinking. The Scottish Government has tended to favour a more cautious approach. Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest. Independence. Boris Johnson is expected to reach out to Scotland with measures designed to promote the Union and stress UK clout. One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref. But not perhaps immediately. Ms Sturgeon herself is in no particular hurry.She knows that anxious voters will expect a laser focus on recovering from coronavirus.More, the FM fully understands that the independence offer in Scotland has always been predicated upon confidence.

Rather than fleeing from a perceived threat.That is why SNP Ministers have been so keen to govern moderately and sensibly, within existing devolved powers, while simultaneously promoting independence.Read more from Brian Taylor: Why Nicola Sturgeon offers her supporters Paradise DeferredBrexit, in particular, may create the conditions for revisiting the independence prospect, not least because Scotland was told that staying in the UK was the only way to retain EU membership.However, add Brexit to the virus and economic worries. That does not equate to a confident public. Quite the contrary. Voters might feel inclined to keep a-hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse. They might, at the very least, prefer to delay the decision.Finally, from the political to the personal. Nicola Sturgeon must be simply exhausted. A bizarre yet enervating election on top of endless endeavours to counter coronavirus and sustain the economy.All that plus Alex Salmond, seemingly at her shoulder for months, leading up to his unwanted offer of Holyrood help in pursuit of independence.For Nicola Sturgeon, then, time for rest and recuperation.

The English results may spell trouble for Scottish Labour and an opportunity for the SNP.The full results may hint at whether the last electionrsquos realignments in England look solid, with the newly interventionist, free-spending Tories winning over non-metropolitan, working-class voters, and Labour confined to London and the graduate middle-class in a couple of other big cities and a few liberal outposts.What look certain are convincing wins for both the Prime Minister and Nicola Sturgeon. That will be advanced by pro-independence voices as evidence of a gulf between Scottish and English aspirations.The weight of expectation means thatthe SNP narrowly fails to gain a majority, the immediate prospect of another referendum may diminish, but calls for one will certainly not. However, the SNP should not make such a vote Holyroodrsquos priority, even in the unlikely event that Westminster accepts it as a mandate and grants the power to introduce it.The consensus, even among most of those unwaveringly committed to a second referendum ndash indeed, the position professed by Ms Sturgeon herself ndash is that building recovery from an unprecedented economic, social and human crisis must take precedence over all .The Conservatives and the SNP may appear to dfer on almost everything, but while both enjoy solid mandates to govern, it is vital that they find a way to work together that builds up the chance of real improvements for ordinary voters. No matter their antipathy on the issue of the Union, other areas of policy that require effective action are broadly similar, and would benefit from productive co-operation.Rather than railing at Westminster, the Scottish Government should acknowledge that there have been shortcomings in a host of areas that have been entirely under its control, such as education, health, drugs policy, public procurement ndash notably over ferries ndash and that they need urgent action. That will involve responsible finances, and working with business to fashion a programme for growth and to safeguard jobs. Similarly, the Westminster government must treat their Scottish counterparts with the respect they deserve.Despite the prevailing view of him in Scotland, growth is what many English voters hope for from Mr Johnson, especially in Northern constituencies: investment in infrastructure, increased health spending, support for companies, a coherent trade policy for the post-Brexit period, serious reforms in housing, restoring trust and ldquoleveling up.Whether that faith is well founded remains to be seen, but the UK Treasury is spending at a staggering rate, especially for a Conservative administration. Here, of course, it will be the First Minister who decides how to direct those funds to bolster recovery. Constructive co-operation, not point-scoring, on both sides will be essential to bring that about.No one expects aspirations or conflicts over constitutional issues to melt away. Advocates and opponents of independence ought to make their respective cases. But even the most ardent adherents of either position should recognise that most voters ndash and the blunt realities of our circumstances ndash demand that practical measures to improve peoplersquos everyday security take priority over ideological stances, however dearly held. There are uncertainties and challenges enough to be going on with, on which lives and livelihoods depend other big questions will not go away, but theyrsquoll keep for a wee

One suspects that some people in the SNP will regard this as a disappointment.ldquoSo, Ms Sturgeon is going to be in a weaker position, vis-a-vis her party, and that will give her less room for manoeuvre in trying to play the timing of the referendum, or the referendum request long rather than short.ldquoSo, Ms Sturgeon, because shersquos in a weaker position, might now want to push for the referendum rather more strongly, but at the same time Boris Johnson may now feel somewhat more emboldened to try and put her off.Arriving at the Glasgow count, the First Minister was asked how confident she was of getting a majority.She said: ldquoLook, a majority has always been a very, very long shot.

So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence.

Before there was a space available for her I was away in college and my mother had to care for my grandmother as dementia caused her to become increasingly dficult to look after.“My mother had very little free time as she had to look after my younger siblings, manage the croft, work five days a week and care for my grandmother. Replacing the old folks’ home with ‘social care flats’ would not be adequate for looking after my grandmother.”Mr MacLeod’s ‘Halt the Hub’ petition on the  degrees website is addressed to the comhairle, Scottish Government, SNP election candidate Alasdair Allan and Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil.It states: “If the comhairle is going to spend £ million on a development on Barra they shouldn’t dismiss opinions expressed by the people living on Barra. The consultation with the local community where most expressed a wish to have separate buildings for dferent local services appears to have been ignored by the decision makers in the comhairle and the Scottish Government.”One petitioner, known as Jeanne C, stated on the  degrees website: “Nothing about this ugly hub is right and there has been insufficient representation from Barra. All facilities will be smaller – with Covid distancing  We will have no care home and Eoligarry [Primary] School will be closed.“The comhairle is spending millions on decanting pupils instead of building the new school just near the old one. The comhairle and the health board can do exactly what they like with our island in the face of our expressed concerns. Lewis, by the way, is to have a new care home.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3787297.jpg--.jpg?1620288585000\n","title":"seth raises 1340 for great cause","story":"A Ballymena teenager has raised more than pound for Macmillan Cancer Support after completing a half marathon at the weekend.

When you think of Portrush, you think of Barry’s.“It would be sadwe lost it, and there’s no doubt that everyone is saying the same thing.“It would be a massive loss to the area. People would still come to Portrush, of course, but the place wouldn’t be the same without Barry’s.”Independent councillor Angela Mulholland, who lives in nearby Portstewart, also said she would like any new buyer to keep the site as it is.“There are already enough apartments and holiday homes in the coastal area without a developer coming along and building more,” she said.“It’s a big draw in terms of tourism to the area and is also a local attraction for local people, so there’s a good combination in terms of those who avail of the attraction.“I hope whoever buys it does so with a view to keeping it as a going concern.”People expressed their dismay on our Facebook site at the thought of losing the age-old fun park.Janine Swindell said: “I thinkit is made into homes or a hotel, it would ruin Portrush’s tourism. Everyone has happy memories from Barry’s. It is such a great attraction.“I really hope someone buys it as a going concern. Would be devastated to see Barry’s go.”Wayne Bright added: “Hope someone takes over this and keeps it going. Wouldn’t be Portrush without Barry’s. Tourism would just go downhill.”David Armstrong said: “Barry#s is what makes Portrush. If there is no Barry#s, there might as well be no Portrush.”But David Kirkland wrote: “Everything has its time, and Barry’s is overdue”.A petition to save the venue from permanent closure previously attracted thousands of signatures.But the Trufelli family said it was their intention to “re-market the business for sale”, adding that the sales process had been hindered by the pandemic and resulting economic conditions.“Whilst our hope is that we will be able to sell the business as a going concern, we recognise that it may not be possible to find a suitable purchaser,” they said.“As a result, we have appointed Savills and Philip Tweedie  Company to market the site as both a going concern and a development opportunity.“Barry’s continues to remain closed in line with Covid restrictions and will not reopen until the sale process has concluded.”Barry’s, which sits on the Castle Erin Road seafront, opened in Portrush in  after members of two circus families, Evelyn Chipperfield and Francesco Trufelli, met in Ireland and later married.They continued to tour the country together before, in , they were invited by the Railway Company to set up a permanent site in Portrush.It is believed to be Ireland#s longest-running amusement park and stayed open every summer throughout the Troubles.It has been closed since the summer of .In February last year, Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council voted not to issue a Building Preservation Notice on the site.Neal Morrison, director of Savills Ireland, said: We expect demand to be strong due to the potential that this site offers.Philip Tweedie, of Philip Tweedie  Company, added: This is in essence the last true seafront site available in Portrush town.

Credit: Kevin Scott   Belfast Ralph HewittTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFormer UTV presenter Lynda Bryans has said she left the Presbyterian Church after its “cruel” decision to deny anyone in a same-sex relationship full membership.In  the Presbyterian Church in Irelandadopted the new policy.The move meant the children of gay couples could not be baptised by the Church.It came after the Church cut ceremonial ties with the Church of Scotland due to its more liberal attitude to same-sex relationships.The Presbyterian Church made it clear at the time the policy did not prevent people in a same-sex relationship from attending services.Speaking to Alf McCreary in this weekend’s Belfast , Ms Bryans, who co-hosted UTV’s evening news programme with her former husband Mike Nesbitt in the s and s, was askedshe was ever ashamed of her own Church or denomination.The -year-old replied: “I was a member of the Presbyterian Church until a few years ago. I couldn#t stay after the vote the PCI took about same-sex relationships, particularly the refusal to baptise children of gay couples.It’s so sad that they felt it necessary it was cruel, not reflective of Jesus’ love.”Ms Bryans, who is now a journalism lecturer at Belfast politan College, was also asked why so many people were turning their backs on organised religion.She felt too many Churches “made it about religion and ritual and not about a relationship with God”.The Presbyterian Church was asked for a response to Ms Bryans’ remarks but declined to comment.The policy stopping anyone in a same-sex relationship becoming a full member of the Church was contained in a report by its doctrine committee.In  the Presbyterian Church said its general assembly members were not discussing whether to prevent anyone from attending worship, coming into church, receiving communion, or having access to pastoral care, as the Church is open to all.“What was before the general assembly was the acceptance of a paper that posed a theological question of what represents a ‘credible profession of faith’ in our Church and the outworking of that in a person’s le — something that applies to all who want to be a member of our Church, regardless of background, orientation or anything ,” it said.“On many issues the Church provides guidance to our ministers and elders in Kirk Sessions and we wanted to consider what a credible profession of faith means for same-sex couples who want to become communicant members of the Church.The same principle also applies to everyone, regardless of background or circumstance and those who want to baptise their children.”Belfast Most ReadSketrick Island house offers stunning views of Co Down coastTotal funds at controversial Green Pastures Church rise to £mSchool locked down after students taken to hospital in spice vaping emergencyEx-Irish soldier Lisa Smith who moved to Syria and married jihadist wins legal battle over NI banPeter Robinson warns Union at risknew DUP leader appeals to ‘extremes’Top VideosPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!Latest Northern Ireland hunger strikes: #Republican prisoners chose to die... my daddy didn#t choose#Twitter’s ban over Kinahan story by papers questioned, hospital appointments missed in NI inside three yearsUlster University appoints new Pro-vice ChancellorReport from Poots’ department tells of NI Protocol ‘advantages’ for fishermenLatestAnthony HarwoodOpinionPhil Mickelson should be squirming in his seat over Rory McIlroy’s comments on breakaway Super Golf LeagueMan arrested in connection with murder of PCSO Julia JamesMarc Albrighton promises no repeat of Leicester collapseTravel firms hail ‘best day’ of holiday sales in months as green list announcedEU agrees potential . billion-dose purchase of Pfizer vaccine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Stock imageEimear McGovernTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailUnder-s in Northern Ireland are set to be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine over the AstraZeneca  alternative, the Department of Health said on Friday.It’s believed the move will lead to a delay of a few weeks due to limited supply.Why has this change been recommended The recommendation was made by the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationafter new research on blood clots in those who had received the AZ vaccine was published last week.The risk from Covid- is falling, which in turn alters the risk benefit calculations for younger age groups, leading the JCVI to move the age threshold after new slightly increased figures on blood clots were reported.Who does this affect Under-s will be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech jab.Why will the rollout be slower The vaccine rollout programme will be delayed for a few weeks as Pfizer supplies “remain steady but limited”.The head of the vaccine programme here, Patricia Donnelly, said the move has pushed back the rollout by several weeks.“From time to time, as people booked on, they would find they would have to wait a few days or a few weeks to get the appointments they want,” she said, speaking to the BBC’s Evening Extra programme.“That’s going to be a feature over the next few weeks and potentially the next six, eight weeks because we will have steady amounts of vaccine but not enough to do all those people who want it when they want it.“It will be there eventually but it just means they wait a bit longer.”The move may affect the UK’s target of offering a first vaccine dose to every adult by the end of July, but it’s understood Northern Ireland officials are addressing the supply issue with the hope further supplies will arrive next month.How many under-s have been vaccinated Almost % of those aged - and almost % of those aged between - have already been vaccinated.Nearly one million people here have received their first jab.How does this affect meI’ve already had my first dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca People who have already received their first jab of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will get their second jab with the same vaccine.What has been said about clotting There have been  clotting cases from . million doses of the vaccine, according to the UK’s medicines safety regulator but the risk is slightly higher in younger age groups.Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said: “The potential risk associated with the AZ first dose is extremely rare and the threat from Covid- is much higher for the majority of adults. “Getting vaccinated against this virus gives us hope - it protects us and helps us to start reclaim normality.”He said he was looking forward to getting his second dose of the AstraZeneca jab and encouraged everyone to “come forward without delay for their first and second jabs when it’s their turn”.What are the logistical changes From Monday people over the age of  can book AstraZeneca first-dose appointments at Belfast’s SSE Arena vaccination centre and community pharmacies.Those aged - can book their Pfizer first dose appointments at the other regional trust vaccination centres or can receive the AstraZeneca vaccine from participating community pharmaciesthey would rather not wait to receive an alternative.Anyone under  already booked for their first vaccine at one of the trust centres, including the SSE Arena, will have this appointment honoured and will receive the Pfizer vaccine.Will AstraZeneca still play a role in the vaccination programme The Department of Health said the AstraZeneca vaccine is still “essential” in the rollout of the vaccination programme.“Thanks to this programme, close to a million people here have already received their first vaccine dose, helping society to emerge carefully from lockdown,” said a spokesperson.Belfast Most ReadTotal funds at controversial Green Pastures Church rise to £mSketrick Island house offers stunning views of Co Down coastSchool locked down after students taken to hospital in spice vaping emergencyEx-Irish soldier Lisa Smith who moved to Syria and married jihadist wins legal battle over NI banPeter Robinson warns Union at risknew DUP leader appeals to ‘extremes’Top VideosPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!Latest Northern Ireland hunger strikes: #Republican prisoners chose to die... my daddy didn#t choose#Twitter’s ban over Kinahan story by papers questioned, hospital appointments missed in NI inside three yearsUlster University appoints new Pro-vice ChancellorReport from Poots’ department tells of NI Protocol ‘advantages’ for fishermenLatestAnthony HarwoodOpinionPhil Mickelson should be squirming in his seat over Rory McIlroy’s comments on breakaway Super Golf LeagueMarc Albrighton promises no repeat of Leicester collapseTravel firms hail ‘best day’ of holiday sales in months as green list announcedEU agrees potential . billion-dose purchase of Pfizer vaccineMinister admits he is ‘not expecting good news’ in list vote,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That is why we need meaningful, fit for purpose Online Harms legislation as soon as possible, and I continue to press the Government for such an outcome.”Chair of the Assembly’s All Party Group on Press Freedom and Media Sustainability, Matthew O’Toole said the incident raised a number of concerns.“It is very worrying that any journalist or media organisation would have their account locked for reporting a legitimate public interest story, especially one concerning organised crime,” the SDLP South Belfast MLA said.“I am glad that Twitter have apologised and reversed their decision. But it is a chilling reminder of the power of Big Tech in  and the willingness of powerful people to silence reporting they do not like.“In an age when social media s have failed to take action on anonymous smears and allowed misinformation to fly around the globe, it is unacceptable that they would bow to apparent pressure and silence media in this way.“Powerful people, whether politicians or crime bosses, should not get to decide what journalists report.”Editor-in-chief of the Belfastand the Sunday Le, Eoin Brannigan said the issue “has clear implications for the freedom of the press”.“This is matter of great concern to us, as was the outrageous advice that to unlock the account we had to remove the tweets in question, one of which referred to a factual story about a man who has been identied in the High Court in Dublin as a senior figure in organised crime on a global scale. Nothing in the article constitutes ‘private information’,” Mr Brannigan said.“Twitter instructed us to censor ourselveswe wanted to continue to use the accounts in question.“We put a series of questions to Twitter but received no answers. It’s very coincidental that the two tweets in question refer to Daniel Kinahan, yet Twitter won’t explain how enforcement action was taken in error. Given the volume of nasty abuse Twitter allows to circulate every hour, how come these two tweets were deemed worthy of the locking of accounts yet millions more go unchecked ”A Twitter spokesperson apologised and said the enforcement action was taken in error.“We took enforcement action on the accounts you referenced in error. This has been reversed, and access to the accounts has been reinstated,” they said.Belfast Most ReadSketrick Island house offers stunning views of Co Down coastTotal funds at controversial Green Pastures Church rise to £mSchool locked down after students taken to hospital in spice vaping emergencyEx-Irish soldier Lisa Smith who moved to Syria and married jihadist wins legal battle over NI banPeter Robinson warns Union at risknew DUP leader appeals to ‘extremes’Top VideosPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!Latest Northern Ireland hunger strikes: #Republican prisoners chose to die... my daddy didn#t choose#, hospital appointments missed in NI inside three yearsUlster University appoints new Pro-vice ChancellorReport from Poots’ department tells of NI Protocol ‘advantages’ for fishermenSuzanne BreenOpinionPaula Bradley may be a shrewd move by the Poots campLatestAnthony HarwoodOpinionPhil Mickelson should be squirming in his seat over Rory McIlroy’s comments on breakaway Super Golf LeagueMan arrested in connection with murder of PCSO Julia JamesMarc Albrighton promises no repeat of Leicester collapseTravel firms hail ‘best day’ of holiday sales in months as green list announcedEU agrees potential . billion-dose purchase of Pfizer vaccine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A media briefing was held on Tuesday where the Trust revealed that over  per cent of care home residents have been inoculated. According to Dr Bob Brown, Executive Director of Nursing Primary Care and Older Peoples services, there has also been a ‘very good response’ amongst care home staff. The Trust previously stated that  per cent of care home staff had accepted the vaccine. There are currently no Covid outbreaks in local care homes. The Trust provides care for over , service users in their own homes every day. There has been  per cent vaccine uptake amongst home care staff. googletag.cmd.push Information on vaccine uptake amongst hospital staff and Trust-wide numbers are not available, the meeting heard. Dr Brown explained: “I would say that’s not information that we would be providing on the basis that we cannot ask iniduals, have you or have you not had a vaccine.” “Therefore, we’re working on the basis of exit information. We know we’ve had an increasingly positive uptake but, he said, it’s dficult to provide evidence of specic numbers in each area.” Askedstaff on high-risk hospital wards would be encouraged to take the vaccine, such as those who treat cancer patients, he said: “We’ll certainly use every opportunity we can through our leadership walks to encourage uptake of the vaccine, that’s something as a corporate management team that we have taken as a priority in recent weeks, to absolutely do that.” googletag.cmd.push Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen added: “We continue to have very stringent infection control measures at ward level, continue to have the use of PPE and social distancing as far as possible. “So those measures remain in force and are continually monitored and encouraged by ourselves. “The vaccine is another line of defence but we always will adhere to the very high levels of PPE and infection control at clinical patient contact level.” The prospect of another wave of infections was raised at the media briefing. Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals, said there is some data which assures the Trust ‘no high surge’ is anticipated over the summer but a ‘small spike’ could take place at the end of Autumn and beginning of Winter.     She continued: “That would be normal winter pressures and respiratory disease so we’re not surethere would be any additional spike there due to Covid. “That’s the basic information we have at this time.” Dr Kilgallen encouraged the public to take the vaccine and adhere to restrictions to allow the Trust and wider NHS to treat other important health issues. “Take the vaccine when it’s offered but also be aware that restrictions that remain are in our best interests and we should do our best to comply at all times,” she said. ‘VOLUNTARY’ A debate has been ongoing in other parts of the UK about whether the vaccine should be mandatory for care home staff or those working in high-risk areas. The Derry News lodged Freedom of Information requests with the Western Trust, Health and Social Care Board and Department of Health- which oversees the running of the programme - to get a detailed breakdown of vaccine uptake amongst staff. In response, each organisation said it did not hold the information. The DoH explained that thevaccinationprogramme remains voluntary but where uptake is lower than average staff will be ‘encouraged’ to accept the vaccine. A spokesperson said: “As cohorts become eligible, iniduals make their own decisions about stepping forward forvaccination. “The Department does not routinely record reasons why people choose not to bevaccinated. “As the programme proceeds and more information becomes available on uptake rates within particular parts of the HSC workforce, action will be taken to try and encourage uptake in any areas where the uptake levels remains lower than average.” The DoH believes that overall, there has been a ‘good uptake’ of thevaccineamongst health and social care staff. More detailed data will be available in the coming weeks, a spokesperson said. She concluded: “This will enable the Department and Trusts to drill down and obtain more granular data regarding the ious parts of the health service andnecessary focus on those areas with lower uptake rates.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its time to get balls whizzing around coaching sessions, in house games on tap and a multitude of fixtures.Supporters will be absent. As will the use of dressing rooms. But thats okay. In time thatll . For now players need action. Thats the priority, though it would be a nice touchsome of the older fans, who have already been vaccinated, could get out to see a game.This column has also been pushing for the importance of young people getting out and active. The buzz from the endorphins flying around the body is one aspect, but the social interaction they have missed has been colossal.Underage coaches dont realise how much of an influence they have on the players under their watch. From interviewing players from ious teams for nostalgic features, they will often recall their early days playing sport.Just last week, former Ballinderry player Martina Devlin described Rita Moran, a coach at St Marys Magherafelt, as a fantastic person and mentor, a role model and the most influential person on her camogie career. It was more than just sport.As teams go back to training, it makes me think how clubs have a second chance to make a first impression on our youth. Just as a teacher can shape the career path of a student, a coach and sporting memories will determine how far a player will develop. You cant make a horse drink, but it still has to be brought to the water first.Seamus Downey still talks about Laveys one ball each philosophy at underage that helped hone a group of youngsters at a club languishing in the realms of B football into one of the top sides in Ulster. Their indoor facility was a help, but working on the basic skills all year round has worked wonders.The same can be said for Glen, who got their house in order before totally dominating underage football with a group that has their seniors jostling for a place at the top table. People will point to the size of their catchment area, but it wasnt until they organised themselves properly that things started to change.Underage coaching in clubs should be about bringing everyone up a level.Not only will it give everyone an enjoyable experience, which is the number one priority, But, in the long term, it will be a much healthier club.I always remember chatting to Crossmaglen player Cathal Short and looking on with envy at their success. What made them stand out  Yes, they had county players like himself, Oisin McConville, the McEntees and Francie Bellew. But, in club football, , on a given day, the county players from each team were to cancel each other out, Cross other players were of a higher standard. This made the dference.His uncle Aidan, a coach at the club and former teacher in St Patricks Maghera, spoke at an underage coaching camp I attended one weekend in St Marys Magherafelt. He revealed something that has always stuck out.Other clubs in Armagh judged themselves on being able to beat Crossmaglen at underage level. A victory over the Rangers constituted a successful year.In Cross, their benchmark was for the minor team to produce at least four players, every year, to push into the senior  the following season.They didnt concentrate on just the elite. Some years they would churn out more, but four was always the target. Underage medals were a welcome addition and driving the standards of coaching would iniably have them at the cutting edge of competitions.Their underage teams seeing All-Ireland titles being paraded into the hall helped with the motivation, but it still doesnt kick the ball over the bar for you.The biggest challenge in the GAA is giving everyone a chance to play on a regular basis. The Go Games format at the younger ages has been brilliant in terms of smaller sided games. Not only does it give more touches, but a  of  can be split into three teams of seven. There will be no subs and everyone has the chance to test their coaching in a game.The problem started at U level, with full dug-outs. A bigger club, of which there are a few, can add in a few extra Us to take the total to  and enter two U teams. Its not ideal,there is a case of playing across two codes – football and hurling or camogie.The case mentioned above is common, with three teams of seven becoming a team of , with  subs. This is where underage coaches need to ask themselves questions How can I finish the season with  players still coming to coaching sessions  We have all heard stories of the top three or four players not going as far as senior level. Emigration, injury, a loss of interest or their sheer size at underage no longer allowing them to dominate a game at minor level and above.In the long term, its bringing everyone up the ranks so that come senior level, there are enough numbers to field senior and reserve teams with regularity. Thats a healthy club.Bringing more players up through the underage grades is more important than success. Winning the odd trophy is great andyou are able to win U, U, U and minor titles while bringing everyone along, then thats the ultimate.Underage players will stick with youthey are getting games. In a squad of , like above, starting the same team every week is criminal. Ten minutes at the end of a game every week isnt development. It is tokenism.The greatest prize you can give anyoneis a starting jersey. Based on attendance at training, everyone should be given a chance to play a full game as often as possible. If someone is seen as a key player, use games to rotate them into dferent positions. Challenge them to use their weaker side, to develop a dummy. Give them the best possible chance to better themselves. By senior level, they will thank you for it.If you have big numbers at training, ide them up and play seven a side games. Two teams on, the other working on skills with another coach before swapping places. Introduce a competition every so often. Count the blocks, count the assists, count the dummies. Stick a photo of the winning player up on the club social media. Anything to keep things fresh.It is up to coaches at nursery level to give players the skill base. By U, they should be playing as many games as possible. And the more they get at training, the better placed they are to shine in a league game.When the final bell tolls for the season,a coaching group can still boast the same amount of players, they have delivered in spades for them.Thats the sort of impression a coach will leave on a child. After that, their development will take care of itself and a greater sense of self-esteem will see them blossom away from the pitch.What does  hold for the teams in your club  googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidelines, spread over two documents, offer bespoke advice depending on the category of care setting involved. “I fully recognise the importance of visiting for those who are receiving care. I hope this guidance will be widely welcomed, said Mr Swann. “It is also important to remember that the threat from COVID- remains very real. Everyone has a vital role to play when it comes to safe visiting. That includes social distancing, hand hygiene and not visitingyou are feeling unwell yourself.      Visiting was only ever restricted because it was absolutely necessary to do so to protect patients and residents from the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV- virus and subsequent development of COVID- infection. Given the progress that has been made against the virus, the time is now right to take steps to carefully re-introduce visiting. I welcome the work completed to draw up these updated guidance documents and hope that by implementing them we will take another step along the road to recovery.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Akintunde’s deflected shot squeezed past goalkeeper Michael Kelly to frustrate Longford, who thought they had all three points tanks to Rob Manley’s goal. City had not looked like scoring for most of the game after a positive start. Eoin Toal came close on  minutes when another Patching delivery tempted Kelly off his line, but the Longford goalkeeper missed the ball completely and Toal headed towards the open net, only for Dean Zambra to head the ball clear off the line. googletag.cmd.push Longford held out for the first half hour before they troubled the goal at the other end, and it was a decent chance as Shane Elworthy’s cross eluded Toal and landed on the head of Aaron Robinson, but the defender’s header was straight at Nathan Gartside. City were out of the blocks quickly in the second half in response to Ruaidhri Higgins asking for more, and Patching went direct this time, driving a shot at goal which Kelly couldn’t hold, but David Parkhouse couldn’t tur the rebound in under pressure from McDonnell. Derry came close again on  minutes as they began to create in the final third, and Kelly had to e fullto push away a Parkhouse header after Ciaran Coll’s cross. googletag.cmd.push Longford took the lead with just  minutes to go. A hopeful ball into the City area was not dealt with by the home defence and Rob Manley reacted quickest to the loose ball to hook it past Gartside from close range. Kelly kept out Patrick Ferry’s volley as Longford hung on desperately, but their resolve was eventually broken when the ball broke to Akintunde in the area and his shot on the turn somehow squeezed into the net much to Derry City’s relief.

Thats always been Cormac ODoherty. From the U playing in goals for Slaughtneils Feacuteile team, with a stick almost as big as him, to playing in the field at home with his older brothers and sisters, he has always had to learn fast. He sits relaxed in Owenbegs canteen. Wearing a customary red baseball hat and the same ice cool look as standing over frees on pitches across Ulster and beyond. Now , he has eight seasons of senior championship hurling under his belt with Slaughtneil and going into a fth at county level, having been called up by Collie McGurk in Derrys Nicky Rackard winning season. A veteran now. googletag.cmd.push “Maybe,” comes the reply, with a smirk and the same affable nature in which it was offered. “Its starting to feel that way, there are a lot of young boys involved so I am getting to the older half of the group now.” Last season, Slaughtneil hurling boss Michael McShane handed him the captains role and last Tuesday night he was appointed as Derry captain. “This is another big step, it is a challenge and something to look forward to...something that hopefully will be a successful one,” he points out. The new role doesnt bring pressure. The new skipper points to the leaders in the squad that still includes Sean Cassidy, captain under John McEvoy. googletag.cmd.push “We have a lot of players who have played big games, a lot of leaders and it is up to everyone to step up to the mark,” he adds. Personally, its about performing as well as he can. And hopefully the results will fall into place. Looking ahead, Sundays Mayo game is as far as he ventures. And looking back, the two promotion finals stick in the throat, but they are yesterdays news. “Thats done and dusted now, its a dferent year, its a dferent management, a few dferent players and a few dferent teams, so it is a new challenge,” he said.     In the last two seasons, Derrys scoring average was - versus - against. The margins are small. Goalkeeper Sean Kelly saved their bacon on many occasions, but at the other end they didnt lt the green flag often enough to trouble teams, when it matters. ODoherty is often the man picking open defences for club and county. He feels they need to be more clinical in the final third. “Its in the tight games, with a point or two each way. Its maybe that we can create them , but we didnt take them. It is costly in tight games.” It will be the third county management he has played under and he is enthused about having Cormac Hippy Donnelly in the frame, who coached Slaughtneil to two Ulster senior titles. “It is hard to put your finger on it,” said ODoherty of the input of Donnelly, who was a popular addition with the Derry players. “Mickeyhad been there and he came in with new ideas to the group and a fresh voice that gave us a bit of renewed energy. A new coach always brings new ideas. “Then you have Woodyssuccess with thecamogs, thats two experienced men. “They were good players and Cormac is new into management, we saw in Slaughtneil what he brings to the setup. “Then you back that up with Conorand Kevin , two players who gave a lot to Derry hurling and have that Derry experience, so hopefully that will stand to them.” Murray won back to back Ulster medals with Derry in and . “It is somethingthat we dont have the opportunity to do any more,” ODoherty adds. “He is somebody who had success with Derry senior hurlers and won major honours, it is great to see that and he brings something dferent to the party as well.” Of the  new players in this years , his brother Oisin makes a , with Gerald Bradley, Conor McAllister, Niall Ferris and Brian Cassidy. “It is a strong  of players,” Cormac states. “Ferryhas committed and it is something we have worked on over the past number of years, getting the best players out. We have managed that and it is a good opportunity to take advantage of it.” It has been something that has been a theme since Collie McGurk took over in , of getting the best players hurling for the county. “Collie was a big believer in getting the best players on the pitch and well see what happens after that. “Dominic and Cormac have put a very strong  together, it is up to the players to make use of it.” Getting off to a winning start in Mayo on Sunday is crucial. Despite the Kildare game poised in the distance as a potential top of the table clash in the group, ODoherty is keeping his thoughts in the short term. Any mention of the Christy Ring Cup is casually brushed off. If you start looking too far down the line youll get caught,” he said. “Our focus is on the Mayo game,you lose that then you are chasing for the rest of the league, so it is important to get a good start.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thats always been Cormac ODoherty. From the U playing in goals for Slaughtneils Feacuteile team, with a stick almost as big as him, to playing in the field at home with his older brothers and sisters, he has always had to learn fast. He sits relaxed in Owenbegs canteen. Wearing a customary red baseball hat and the same ice cool look as standing over frees on pitches across Ulster and beyond. Now , he has eight seasons of senior championship hurling under his belt with Slaughtneil and going into a fth at county level, having been called up by Collie McGurk in Derrys Nicky Rackard winning season. A veteran now. googletag.cmd.push “Maybe,” comes the reply, with a smirk and the same affable nature in which it was offered. “Its starting to feel that way, there are a lot of young boys involved so I am getting to the older half of the group now.” Last season, Slaughtneil hurling boss Michael McShane handed him the captains role and last Tuesday night he was appointed as Derry captain. “This is another big step, it is a challenge and something to look forward to...something that hopefully will be a successful one,” he points out. The new role doesnt bring pressure. The new skipper points to the leaders in the squad that still includes Sean Cassidy, captain under John McEvoy. googletag.cmd.push “We have a lot of players who have played big games, a lot of leaders and it is up to everyone to step up to the mark,” he adds. Personally, its about performing as well as he can. And hopefully the results will fall into place. Looking ahead, Sundays Mayo game is as far as he ventures. And looking back, the two promotion finals stick in the throat, but they are yesterdays news. “Thats done and dusted now, its a dferent year, its a dferent management, a few dferent players and a few dferent teams, so it is a new challenge,” he said.     In the last two seasons, Derrys scoring average was - versus - against. The margins are small. Goalkeeper Sean Kelly saved their bacon on many occasions, but at the other end they didnt lt the green flag often enough to trouble teams, when it matters. ODoherty is often the man picking open defences for club and county. He feels they need to be more clinical in the final third. “Its in the tight games, with a point or two each way. Its maybe that we can create them , but we didnt take them. It is costly in tight games.” It will be the third county management he has played under and he is enthused about having Cormac Hippy Donnelly in the frame, who coached Slaughtneil to two Ulster senior titles. “It is hard to put your finger on it,” said ODoherty of the input of Donnelly, who was a popular addition with the Derry players. “Mickeyhad been there and he came in with new ideas to the group and a fresh voice that gave us a bit of renewed energy. A new coach always brings new ideas. “Then you have Woodyssuccess with thecamogs, thats two experienced men. “They were good players and Cormac is new into management, we saw in Slaughtneil what he brings to the setup. “Then you back that up with Conorand Kevin , two players who gave a lot to Derry hurling and have that Derry experience, so hopefully that will stand to them.” Murray won back to back Ulster medals with Derry in and . “It is somethingthat we dont have the opportunity to do any more,” ODoherty adds. “He is somebody who had success with Derry senior hurlers and won major honours, it is great to see that and he brings something dferent to the party as well.” Of the  new players in this years , his brother Oisin makes a , with Gerald Bradley, Conor McAllister, Niall Ferris and Brian Cassidy. “It is a strong  of players,” Cormac states. “Ferryhas committed and it is something we have worked on over the past number of years, getting the best players out. We have managed that and it is a good opportunity to take advantage of it.” It has been something that has been a theme since Collie McGurk took over in , of getting the best players hurling for the county. “Collie was a big believer in getting the best players on the pitch and well see what happens after that. “Dominic and Cormac have put a very strong  together, it is up to the players to make use of it.” Getting off to a winning start in Mayo on Sunday is crucial. Despite the Kildare game poised in the distance as a potential top of the table clash in the group, ODoherty is keeping his thoughts in the short term. Any mention of the Christy Ring Cup is casually brushed off. If you start looking too far down the line youll get caught,” he said. “Our focus is on the Mayo game,you lose that then you are chasing for the rest of the league, so it is important to get a good start.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Collie McGurk took them from the Nicky Rackard Cup to the cusp of a Christy Ring Cup Final. An inspired goalkeeping performance from Kildare goalkeeper Paddy McKenna thwarted theirto Croke Park. Two years ago, John McEvoy came in as boss and an impressive season took them back to the league decider, where Derry lost to Wicklow in a low scoring afternoon at a blustery Inniskeen. A day when Brian Oacuteg McGilligan hobbled off after  minutes and the appearance of Brendan Rogers wasnt able to spark the goal they needed to take them over the line. googletag.cmd.push Last year, after ticking along nicely, Covid kicked in and when the league final was played, Derry werent at the races. It wasnt even a contest. Dominic Woody McKinley came in as joint manager this season, alongside Cormac Donnelly. McKinley, who managed both Derry senior hurlers and camogs in the past, knows what he wants from this season. “My personal opinion is that the National League is more important than the championship to us,” McKinley outlined. He has been around the block. An All-Ireland winner with Loughgiel in , an All-Ireland Final appearance with Antrim in , he coached Antrim at all levels and was a major cog in Slaughtneils rise to the pinnacle of camogie. googletag.cmd.push Sitting at Derry hurlers press evening last week, there is enthusiasm as he talks hurling. The words flow with a passion. The facial expressions dont tell any lies. Its about getting Derry up a level. There is a hurt that hurlers below the elite, top level counties dont get the recognition. Counties like Derry. Seven or eight of their squad are capable of playing at any level. When the Champion  - the All-Star team from the Christy Ring, Nicky Rackard and Lory Meagher Cups – was announced, Derry werent represented. “I suppose you have to earn that,” Woody admits. “The only way is to keep your head down, work hard and then people will recognise you as a group.     “I want Derry to get up a league, you get more of a profile for the players and get to play against better teams. “If you are playing at a higher standard, it is more attractive for the media and hurling people. If I had a choice, Id love to get moved up a league.” As our conversation continues, Liaison Officer Terry Gray issues a list of the Derry squad. Of the  names, Alan Grant is in rehab from a knee injury last year. The  is open, but McKinley is happy with the squad. Brian Cassidy, Niall Ferris and Gerald Bradley are back on board to give them extra attacking options. There is afor Slaughtneil goalkeeper Oisin ODoherty, who last donned the Derry goalkeeper jersey in  having played outfield the previous year. “That was the first thing we looked at before we got the job, could me and Cormac draw all these players all back in again,” he points out. Dual players arent on the table. Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers have played under the last two management teams. But it was a balancing act. The fixture calendar doesnt permit it. Mark Craig is managing his long-term back injury. Brian Cassidy and Conor McAllister are doubts for the Mayo game, but everyone should be available for selection. Challenge games arent on the menu. It frustrates McKinley, so an in-house game last weekend will have to do as they sharpen the focus for the season ahead. “A lot of wee niggly injuries are there now that club training has started as well,” adds McKinley, as frustration creeps into his voice, from the increased workload on the players. “We want to manage it so they are there for the full season for club and county.” There is a plea to clubs, who wont have their serious business until the heel of the year. “These matches are very important for Derry hurling as well,” he adds, while hailing the support of Chairman Stephen Barker. “He is very fair,” Woody states. “He is wanting progress. It is a serious business and we need to be serious about getting themup a level and thats what the players want.” The closest Derry came to promotion was their  decider, a day when Wicklows goal was the dference. Its Derrys failure to find the net that has left them on the wrong side of tight games. During the off-season, selector Conor Murray has been looking into the scoring statistics and Derrys know where the gains are to be made. “He came back to us and it is interesting reading,” McKinley said. “If you were looking at it from another teams point of view, you could think theyll capitalise on our team by blocking a couple of players off in our forward line and wed be in serious bother. “So we are looking for a greater spread of scores,you look at the players we have, there is no doubt we can.” McKinley questions Derrys team play, shot selection...all the pieces of the puzzle of their scoring conundrum. “Thats what weve been going over this last few weeks and hopefully we can get more out of it,” he continues. “We are even recording what we are scoring in our training games, what we do in each sector, to seeour scoring averages are up.” Now the challenge is taking it to Castlebar on Sunday.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Collie McGurk took them from the Nicky Rackard Cup to the cusp of a Christy Ring Cup Final. An inspired goalkeeping performance from Kildare goalkeeper Paddy McKenna thwarted theirto Croke Park. Two years ago, John McEvoy came in as boss and an impressive season took them back to the league decider, where Derry lost to Wicklow in a low scoring afternoon at a blustery Inniskeen. A day when Brian Oacuteg McGilligan hobbled off after  minutes and the appearance of Brendan Rogers wasnt able to spark the goal they needed to take them over the line. googletag.cmd.push Last year, after ticking along nicely, Covid kicked in and when the league final was played, Derry werent at the races. It wasnt even a contest. Dominic Woody McKinley came in as joint manager this season, alongside Cormac Donnelly. McKinley, who managed both Derry senior hurlers and camogs in the past, knows what he wants from this season. “My personal opinion is that the National League is more important than the championship to us,” McKinley outlined. He has been around the block. An All-Ireland winner with Loughgiel in , an All-Ireland Final appearance with Antrim in , he coached Antrim at all levels and was a major cog in Slaughtneils rise to the pinnacle of camogie. googletag.cmd.push Sitting at Derry hurlers press evening last week, there is enthusiasm as he talks hurling. The words flow with a passion. The facial expressions dont tell any lies. Its about getting Derry up a level. There is a hurt that hurlers below the elite, top level counties dont get the recognition. Counties like Derry. Seven or eight of their squad are capable of playing at any level. When the Champion  - the All-Star team from the Christy Ring, Nicky Rackard and Lory Meagher Cups – was announced, Derry werent represented. “I suppose you have to earn that,” Woody admits. “The only way is to keep your head down, work hard and then people will recognise you as a group.     “I want Derry to get up a league, you get more of a profile for the players and get to play against better teams. “If you are playing at a higher standard, it is more attractive for the media and hurling people. If I had a choice, Id love to get moved up a league.” As our conversation continues, Liaison Officer Terry Gray issues a list of the Derry squad. Of the  names, Alan Grant is in rehab from a knee injury last year. The  is open, but McKinley is happy with the squad. Brian Cassidy, Niall Ferris and Gerald Bradley are back on board to give them extra attacking options. There is afor Slaughtneil goalkeeper Oisin ODoherty, who last donned the Derry goalkeeper jersey in  having played outfield the previous year. “That was the first thing we looked at before we got the job, could me and Cormac draw all these players all back in again,” he points out. Dual players arent on the table. Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers have played under the last two management teams. But it was a balancing act. The fixture calendar doesnt permit it. Mark Craig is managing his long-term back injury. Brian Cassidy and Conor McAllister are doubts for the Mayo game, but everyone should be available for selection. Challenge games arent on the menu. It frustrates McKinley, so an in-house game last weekend will have to do as they sharpen the focus for the season ahead. “A lot of wee niggly injuries are there now that club training has started as well,” adds McKinley, as frustration creeps into his voice, from the increased workload on the players. “We want to manage it so they are there for the full season for club and county.” There is a plea to clubs, who wont have their serious business until the heel of the year. “These matches are very important for Derry hurling as well,” he adds, while hailing the support of Chairman Stephen Barker. “He is very fair,” Woody states. “He is wanting progress. It is a serious business and we need to be serious about getting themup a level and thats what the players want.” The closest Derry came to promotion was their  decider, a day when Wicklows goal was the dference. Its Derrys failure to find the net that has left them on the wrong side of tight games. During the off-season, selector Conor Murray has been looking into the scoring statistics and Derrys know where the gains are to be made. “He came back to us and it is interesting reading,” McKinley said. “If you were looking at it from another teams point of view, you could think theyll capitalise on our team by blocking a couple of players off in our forward line and wed be in serious bother. “So we are looking for a greater spread of scores,you look at the players we have, there is no doubt we can.” McKinley questions Derrys team play, shot selection...all the pieces of the puzzle of their scoring conundrum. “Thats what weve been going over this last few weeks and hopefully we can get more out of it,” he continues. “We are even recording what we are scoring in our training games, what we do in each sector, to seeour scoring averages are up.” Now the challenge is taking it to Castlebar on Sunday.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Grade A listed building also known as ‘The People’s Hall,’ was the venue of choice for some of the world’s most iconic performers and notaries after it was built in . But how many people nowadays know that its remarkable guests included both Emmeline Pankhurst and Eleanor Marx   Emmeline Pankhurstwas the leader of the radical suffragette movement that played a key role in helping to win British women the right to vote. googletag.cmd.push She was founder of the Women’s Social and Political Union and gave a rousing speech in St Columb’s Hall on th October . Eleanor Marx, the daughter of German socialist revolutionary Karl Marx, organised a trade union recruitment drive for Derry’s mainly female factory workers in St Columb’s Hall on th November , just five years after the distinctive venue was built at Orchard Street within the Walled City. Friends of the Factories  “in solidarity with” Derry Trades Union Council, organised the placement of two plaques side by side to coincide with events to mark May Day weekend, the annual celebration of workers and union rights across the world. googletag.cmd.push The plaque erected in memory of Emmeline Pankhurst was a tribute shared with Margaret Cousins, the Irish and Indian suffragettewho attended Victoria High School in Derry. Co-founder of the Irish Women’s Franchise League, Dublin in , she was credited with organising and inviting Pankhurst to speak at St Columb’s Hall in . The plaque dedicated to Eleanor Marx who visited the Hall almost  years before Pankhurst, reads: “Eleanor Marx, Fighter for socialism and women’s rights . In this hall, th November , Eleanor launched a recruitment drive for women and general workers previously excluded from most union activity.     The organisation of Derry shirt factory workers was a key moment in the development of trades unionism in Britain and Ireland.” Yvonne Norris, local campaigner with Friends of the Factories , said: “Friends of the Factories came together at the most dficult of times, united in doing something positive by contributing to the legacy of the factory workers and their contribution to the City. I have been honoured to be part of an initiative made up of so many formidable women, driven by women and achieved by women. We thank the Derry Trades Union Council for their unwavering support of our project, it has got us to the point we have reached today. As well as the ceremony in honour of the two female revolutionary thinkers who addressed rallies in St Columb’s Hall, plaques to honour the legacy of the workers were also unveiled at a number of former shirt factory sites including Welch Margeston, Sinclair, Ebrington, Rosemount, Hogg  Mitchell and the City Factory. Anne-Marie Gallagher, Project Director of St Columb’s Hall, said she was delighted that the roles of three illustrious women historically associated with the venue, had finally been etched into the fabric of the building more than a century later. She said: “These beautul plaques are very much in keeping with the character of the Hall and add to the already vibrant story of Derry’s built heritage and history. The fact that these remarkable women left such a lasting legacy is very poignant, especially to think that they were standing in here over  years ago. “We are thankful to Friends of the Factories and Derry Trades Union Council for their foresight and determination in shining the spotlight on the somewhat lesser-known connections with this building’s rich history to the wider world.” St Columb’s Hall is located on the East Wall of the city’s historic Walls and was originally built in  by the St Columb’s Hall Total Abstinence Society as part of the Temperance movement. Now used as a noted conference and events venue, the building is currently in the midst of a major regeneration project.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At a Western Trust media briefing, Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals at the Trust, said numbers had risen because children are back outside playing again and more vehicles are on the roads.

Radius Housing is building  new homes in the Creggan area. The project will also bring major improvements to the facilities at Sean Dolan’s GAA club and the construction of a new multi-use community facility on the site. The project will transform the lands to the west of the current Sean Dolan GAC grounds at Bligh’s Lane and represents an investment in excess of poundmillion in the Creggan area. Planning permission was secured in January, and Radius has appointed P  K McKaigue as the contractor for the project, who will be on site in the coming weeks. googletag.cmd.push Radius is working with Sean Dolans GAC, Ulster GAA, Derry City and Strabane District Council, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the Department for Communities on the project. Alongside the signicant investment in  new social homes in an area of acute housing need, this project will support both Sean Dolan’s ambition to develop as a club and also the wider strategic plans of the GAA in growing the prominence of Gaelic games across the city. A range of other opportunities, activities and events, which will have a positive impact on the wider Creggan community, will also be facilitated as a result of the project. googletag.cmd.push Radius Housing is a leading housing developer, constructing more than  new social and affordable homes each year. Radius also manages more than , social homes, and provides care and support for many more across Northern Ireland. This project is the latest Radius development in Derry, with construction currently underway on the former site of Ebrington Primary School in the Waterside. Anita Conway, Director of Development at Radius Housing, said: “We are delighted that the construction of this major project is beginning, and we are excited by the ambition and benefits this will bring to the whole community. “We have been working with Sean Dolan’s GAC and the other partner organisations for over three years, and we see this as an innovative way to deliver high quality homes, in an area where social homes are needed, and support essential community development.     “As a developer we know the dficulties faced in acquiring suitable development land, and working with Sean Dolan’s we have both been able to develop an innovative partnership approach which addresses a wide range of needs in the local area. “Working with community based clubs like Sean Dolan’s allows Radius to help them realise their untapped potential, and bring much needed homes to the local area and maximise all available amenities within these areas for the benefit of the local communities. “This is so much more than a housing project and a sports hub. This will be a vital economic and social driver for the Creggan area and City wide.” Stephen McGeehan, Head of Operations for Ulster GAA, said: “Every GAA club is keen to develop the best facilities for their members, which allow their teams across all ages to develop their skills and increase fitness and wellbeing. “But there are always limitations on how this can be done, and we are delighted that Sean Dolan’s have been able to partner with Radius Housing on this amazing and far reaching project. “This will bring an incredible level of community benefit, not just to the club, but to the wider city area, and we hope it is a new partnership model which can be replicated in other GAA and sports clubs.” Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has welcomed commencement ofthework on the new much needed social homes in the city. “I’m delighted to see this work started. My priority is to deliver housing in areas where it is needed,and Derry City needs more housing. “This pound million investment is part of my new build programme, a programme I was able to secure poundmillion to be invested this year. “I commendthe work of Radius Housing and Sean Dolan’s GAC for working together on this ground breaking scheme. “This is co-operative working at its very best and I look forward to seeing the finished scheme in due course. “I look forward to seeing other developments in the near future as we continue to deliver the biggest shake up of our housing system in over  years. “Housing, and having a place to call home, is a fundamental right. I am committed to delivering a housing system that delivers rights to everyone across society.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council are coming together to set up and manage the Creative Encounters project. The aim of the project is to create a one-stop online directory for people and families planning a day out in either or both counties. The councils have now issued a tender seeking companies who could create such a directory. In a joint statement included in the tender documents, the two councils state that they had commissioned an audience survey across the north west in a bid to better understand the barriers to cultural engagement faced by our citizens. googletag.cmd.push “This research was used to inform a subsequent Audience Development Plan which identied older people and families as two key audience target segments. “Older people were identied as a segment that was the least engaged with cultureand the partner councils were keen to ensure that this imbalance was addressed. “Families were identied as a market opportunity, an audience segment upon which the sector could focus the rebuilding of audiences and participatory engagement as we emerge from the worst of the Covid crisis. “The NW Audience Survey research findings and the NW Audience Development Plan The plan incorporates a range of actions designed to encourage better engagement of the target segments.” googletag.cmd.push As part of the process, the councils have looked at websites such as familyexplorers, dayoutwiththekids and fantasticforfamilies. They now want to create a similar website focused on the Derry and Donegal regions. “In essence the project is designed to make it simpler for families to plan days out by providing all the practical information in one place,” the council statement concluded.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a statement today, the Trufelli family said that as thingsto a more favourable economic environment, it is their intention to re-market the business for sale. “Whilst our hope is that we will be able to sell the business as a going concern, we recognise that it may not be possible to find a suitable purchaser,” the statement said. googletag.cmd.push “As a result, we have appointed Savills and Philip Tweedie  Company to market the site as both a going concern and a development opportunity. “Barry’s continues to remain closed in line with Covid restrictions and will not re-open until the sale process has concluded.” The Barrys site has been placed on the market with a guide price of pound.m. The high-profile seafront site is situated in the heart of the town, between the newly renovated Portrush Train Station and The West Bay Beach. The sale is being handled by joint agents, Savills and Philip Tweedie  Company, on behalf of Barry’s Amusements and is being marketed as a development opportunity but equally would not disregard the potential purchase as a going concern. googletag.cmd.push A feasibility study undertaken by Savills has revealed that the site could be developed for several uses, including a -bed hotel,  residential dwellings or a combination of both, in addition to leisure and recreational facilities.

Longfords win clinched promotion, as the first placed team. Elsewhere, Wexfords one-point win at home to mid-table Carlow saw them finish second, with Derry in third place.     Jamsie Martin hit - from play in the first half, as the home side shot into a - to - interval lead, but they had to thank goalkeeper Gavin Tonra for his two point blank saves to deny Paddy Bradley. When Paul Barden floated over Longfords final point of the game, they were well in control, despite Derry hitting the last three points.

Trevor Smullen netted for Longford as Derry led - to - at the break. The game was still in its first minute when Bradley took advantage of a defensive mistake to fire the ball into the net. In injury-time Bradley netted from the penalty spot after he was fouled. The gap increased to three early in the second half before Longford hit four points without reply. David Barden wasted an excellent goal chance for Longford and Derry took advantage as Joe Diver pointed.

Qualiers RLongford - Derry -Longford earned a dramatic win in a chaotic finish at Pearse Park. There was controversy too. Derrys Barry McGoldrick, who had marauded forward from corner-back to grab two goals, picked up a second yellow card after a melee in the Longford goalmouth in the th minute of injury time. Minutes later, Derry sub Joe Diver scored a goal reminiscent of Joe Sheridans against Louth two previously - this time referee Michael Duffy awarded a free out and Longford were safe. Longford had led by three at the break, - to -, thanks largely to the accuracy from frees of Sean McCormack. Paddy Bradley showed all his class too in the opening phase of the game and was at the heart of anything productive from Derry. McGoldricks first goal levelled the match, finishing coolly, after being set up by Paddy Bradley. His second goal put Derry in the driving seat, despite not playing well. Again McCormack got Longford level and then the home side went in front and on their way to victory.

They led by - to - after a lacklustre first half, the best moments being two James Kielt scores. The gap was narrower still by almost the midway point of the second half, when Glenn Ryans side pulled themselves back to within two at - to -. But with their counter-attacking game taking its toll on the Longford legs, Derry started to find space up front and ran out easy winners.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it. All I can do is pray for them.During lockdown Mr Ahern shared how he went to mass regularly from his kitchen in Drumcondra, sharing masses online from Clonard monastery in Belfast, as well as Derry, Cork and Dublin.He said lockdown had given people time to reflect and enjoy walking, something he really enjoys.He told the podcasters mdash former Sisters of Adoration who are now pilgrim guides on Saint Patrickrsquos Way Downpatrick mdash that ldquohe would love to come and walk the Irish Camino with them.He revealed he had spent nine months of the lockdown reading The Annals of the Four Masters, chronicles of medieval Irish history.Mr Ahern described it as a ldquotough read, admitting he could only manage  pages a day.Asked what he would like to banish from Ireland, in the Spirit of St Patrick, he said ldquoinjustice and violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Breast.jpg","title":"Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing  ","story":"WHEN Joanne Masseyrsquos second child, Edward, was born six months ago, she knew she wanted to breastfeed him, but also,possible, donate to the milk bank.Weighing in at just over lbs, Edward fed for  minutes soon after he was born and it seemed like establishing feeding would be no problem.However, a few months before Edward was born, Joannersquos family found out her father, Jim Watson, had cancer.She explained: ldquoEventually we would learn it was terminal. So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey. So often there isnrsquot enough support available for mums especially with breastfeeding, and Covid made it more dficult as the usual support groups had all closed. Thatrsquos why peer support is so valuable as it provides one to one support for mums at the most important time.Aine highlighted the need for support for breastfeeding mums. ldquoWe need to be offering all mums support from the very first chance which is the case for a lot, but sometimes mums donrsquot know about us until itrsquos too late. ldquoI am thankful to Joanne for sharing this experience with me and I know we will still be in touch for a long time.ldquoAnd even though Irsquom sure she will downplay what she has achieved, I can honestly say I am so proud of her and all her hard work.Mothers can be referred to the Trustrsquos breastfeeding support worker through midwery and health visiting services..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Carlisle.jpg","title":"Carlisle’s staff in charity hike in memory of much loved Pat  ","story":"ONE hundred staff and friends at Carlislersquos in Ballynahinch are each walking five miles this week on a sponsored walk in honour of a much-loved colleague who died last month.Pat Greene, who was from Saintfield, died on April , much to the shock and sorrow of everyone at the business.The  year-old had worked for Carlislersquos for  years, starting off as a coal boy, going on to work in all areas of the business and finishing as a work supervisor.Donna Carlisle explained that Pat loved The Proclaimers song Irsquom Gonna Beand it inspired the charity effort from staff members, past and present, and their partners.ldquoIt was Patrsquos favourite song and it had to be on the playlist at all our party nights when we raised money for ious cancer charities. Raising money for these charities was always important to Patrick as his mother sadly passed away from the disease when he was young, she said.ldquoHe never missed any of the parties and when The Proclaimers came on I always remember Pat taking centre stage and all of us had to follow him and his actions and it was always very important we did it right.ldquoThis is one memory of Pat we will never forget. We think it is very fitting that between us all we will walk those  miles for our friend and colleague whilst raising much needed funds for Cancer Focus NI in his name.The walkers aim to complete the  miles by Sunday, having started last Sunday.Mrs Carlisle praised her late colleague as a person who was ldquouniversally liked.ldquoI honestly never heard one bad word said about Pat. He was just one of those members of staff you just loved to have around you, she said. ldquoHe was brilliant, did anything and always tried to keep everyone right. He was always there and became part of the furniture, as they say.ldquoHe really became a friend over the years and he will be sorely missed by us all.Money will be raised through staff sponsorship and JustGiving donation on Carlislersquos Facebook page. Contributions can also be left into the Belfast Road shop in Ballynahinch.Carlislersquos Fuels have donated  litres of oil while Carlislersquos Food SuperValu is donating pound worth shopping vouchers for a prize draw for everyone who donates.The draw will take place on Monday, May , and winners will be contacted by Facebook page or telephone.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

It didnrsquot sink in until I was driving away from the ceremony and it was a great feeling.The jump jockey star first began his interest in horses after watching the races at Downpatrick Racecourse with his family when he was just eight years old. Since then, he carried on visiting the local racetrack with friends and soon caught the racing bug.ldquoI went to a few point-to-pointers with the McCartan family who we know well. It wasnrsquot long after that I got on the saddle for the first time and I got going from there, said Danny.The golden boy started off with Downpatrick trainer Brian Hamilton before working with group one winning flat trainer Ger Lyons in Kildare.On the advice of former Grand National winner Tony Dobbin, Danny then made his big move across the water to Penrith in Cumbria to work under the highly respected trainer Nicky Richards at his famous Greystoke stables.ldquoI was only  when I turned professional and made the move to England. I was very nervous, but Nicky made me feel really welcomed and I settled in quickly, he recalled.ldquoIt was tough at the beginning to be fair but Nicky is very easy to get on with and he knew it was going to be dficult for me.

We have competed a lot together and Irsquove developed my skills with him a lot, we have picked up six or seven wins this season together he said.ldquoThat horse has helped me get to the grade one stage of racing, especially after our massive grade two win.That grade two success was when Danny and Nuts Well secured first place in the valuable Old Roan at Aintree. Nuts Well was picked for an outsider in the race at  , but the talented rider once again showed he was worth his salt as he galloped to glory.This gave Northumberland trainer Ann Hamilton her biggest success to date as they claimed the pound, prize pot.Despite his interest and success in racing, Danny was the first in his family to become heavily involved in the sport.ldquoI come from a sporting background in my family, my two brothers played Gaelic football and soccer growingup, but I was the one who took it upon myself to get into the horses, he said.ldquoOf course my family supported me and helped me achieve were I am today, but I do not come from a racing background.Dannyrsquos parents, Brenda and Denis, were delighted as their son received recognition for an outstanding season and hope that this is just the beginning for the promising young talent.ldquoWe are so proud of him, he has done all of this off his own back, said Brenda.ldquoHe has worked extremely hard to get to this point and I am so glad he is living his dream.ldquoEven though I canrsquot watch his big hurdle races until the final straight as I always have a motherrsquos worry, she added.Danny spent a brief time back with family in Downpatrick but is getting back to business as usual in England.ldquoI just plan on keeping my head down and hope to bring the momentum from this season into the next one, he said.ldquoEverything wouldnrsquot be possible without the help from all of the team at the stables and my familyrsquos support.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost.

Joanne Carson is credited with coming up with a pleasing route for her buddies, Helen Vint, Mags Flynn and Cathy Burke.These girls are to be seen most weekends, rain, hail or shine, chalking up miles in and around Downpatrick. Their dedication is most commendable. In their opinion, a half marathon is long enough to challenge the legs but not as draining as a full marathon so you could almost say that it is an enjoyable task.Joanne got them off to a familiar start. They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

Disposable barbecues are bad for the environment in terms of use and disposal, said the resident.ldquoThese barbecues are made using unsustainable materials from tropical forests in South Africa and South America.ldquoThey canrsquot be recycled, burn grass and typically result in scattered litter. Just like Chinese sky lanterns which the local council previously took action on and which were also once acceptable, the time has come to ban disposable barbecues.The resident said disposable barbecues represent a ldquohuge fire risk, burn the ground underneath them, are often left as litter and contain sharp pieces that can harm animalstrodden on.She added: ldquoThey are used in beauty spots, wildle reserves and on beaches and are just left smouldering. They make it far too easy for people to be irresponsible by putting them directly on the ground and then leaving them there afterwards.ldquoLiving in an area of natural beauty we have many areas were people see fit to light a barbecue. The recent events have shown us we cannot take the risk. The earth is too fragile and the danger to humans and wildle is too great.

Please try again later.Submitting...I remember this well because it was one of the first major in-depth news reports that I covered as a then relatively novice reporter.The investigation related to Paragraph  of those talks.The web version of this article will include the full wording of that paragraph, which said that the Irish and British governments “recognise that there is an issue to be addressed, with the completion of the early release scheme, about supporters of organisations now on cease-fire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before  April ”It went on to say that such people would,convicted, benefit from early release under the Belfast Agreement and “would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued”• See below for full wording of paragraph This was not said to be a general amnesty but rather to relate to people who have been charged but not convicted of an offence, such as those who have jumped bail before or during trial. However, there was concern that the paragraph had been vaguely worded to placate Sinn Fein and would provide a future basis for an amnesty for all terror offences committed pre .It raised the notion that for the first time the UK was conceding that suspects would not necessarily have to answer terrorist charges against them. “We are in the realms of legal revolution,” Austen Morgan, an expert in constitutional law, told me. “We would normally leave these matters to the DPP.”Stephen Farry, then the Alliance Party’s justice spokesman, said: “Until now, it has always been the policy of the governments to regard terrorist activities as criminal offences, albeit politically-motivated ones. This proposal risks giving the impression that actions of republican and loyalist paramilitaries were legitimate.” Dr Farry expressed surprise that other political parties had been relatively quiet over the proposals, believing that the implications of the clause had been underestimated. “In every prosecution you are making a general point as well as particular point,You are saying these things are wrong.”In the end the paragraph never came to pass, due to delays in paramilitary decommissioning.Stormont would in fact fall over such disagreements the next year, and the amnesty proposal of  would also come to nothing.We now know that Tony Blair went on to instigate a secret scheme for On The Runs including Letters of Comfort and even Royal Pardons.You could say that the UK has been determined to end prosecutions for exactly  years.But in fact there has been an informal amnesty since . After all, how feasible was it that Martin McGuinness would be made deputy first minister — a position which, Sinn Fein love to point out, is in effect joint first minister — and then arrested and made to face a criminal trial followed by a jail term His funeral was attended by a host of dignitaries from President Bill Clinton to the first minister Arlene Foster to the chief prosecutor to the head of the PSNI and others.In  the ex RUC assistant chief constable Alan McQuillan wrote on these pages that future legacy crime investigators might face “political pressure, not least from the two governments, not to pursue those whose arrest might ‘destabilise the peace process’”.Yet while no IRA leader has ever faced charges commensurate with their decades of pre meditated murder and mayhem, several soldiers face homicide trials for single shootings.I see real problems with this reported UK plan on prosecutions. But I do not blame them for seeking radical solutions to the scandal of how legacy is panning out.• Paragraph  of the Weston House talks document: “Both Governments also recognise that there is an issue to be addressed, with the completion of the early release scheme, about supporters of organisations now on cease-fire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before  April . Such people would,convicted, stand to benefit from the early release scheme. The Governments accept that it would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued and will as soon as possible, and in any event before the end of the year, take such steps as are necessary in their jurisdictions to resolve this dficulty so that those concerned are no longer pursued.”• Ben Lowry is News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Let us hope that the brilliant Eoghan Harris keeps on writing——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Who remembers the itinerant dispensary of Avon products, queen of s suburbia  JOANNE SAVAGE reminds us she hasn’t gone away you knowBy Joanne SavageSaturday, th May , : am  \"       \"  The Avon Lady, cosmetic heroine of s suburbiaEveryone of a certain vintage will remember the ‘Avon lady’ calling, usually a kind of overdone suburban Stepford we clone with immaculate hair, pillbox hat, and powdered visage, coming up the garden path with her glossy catalogue of lipsticks, nail nishes, skincare products and the like, maybe an array of samples of a cheap perfume, lavender scented face lotion or miracle shampoo on offer for you to sample.‘Ding, dong, it’s the Avon lady!” they would chirrup, these cosmetic godmothers of s suburbia, sort of like a door-to-door agony aunt as well as an itinerant dispensary of magical bargain solutions to lacklustre cheeks, lips that looked unkissable, skin the colour of dirty underwear that needed the apposite Avon unguent to appear peachy, pearly and bedazzled once more. Who remembers the haloed vision of Dianne Weist as Pegg Boggs, the Avon lady in Edward Scissorhands, with the aforementioned pillarbox hat, pale violet dress suit, and kindly demeanour, assured that one of the cosmetic line’s weird potions may even remedy humanoid Edward’s deathly pallor     \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Today there are .m representatives world wide, with the company making an estimated annual revenue of £.bn.“The mission of the company is to empower women,” says the CEO of Avon, Andrea Jung. “The business may have been started by a man, but in the s it was an unpopular thing to give women the opportunity to earn outside the home. It’s about giving women earning opportunities.” Avon spokeswoman, Hollywood actress Reese Witherspoon, is just one of the celebritieswho has helped combat the brand’s occasionally mumsy, bargain basement image, and fundraised for their female-focused causes – such as breast cancer and domestic violence.Avon looks set to be calling at many more UK homes, after the cosmetics company revealed in July that the number of people signing up to be sales representatives had more than doubled under lockdown.The company said it had seen a % “surge” in the number of new representatives joining its UK business since lockdown began.So despite the qauint image of the preened Avon lady of old, it looks like the company has new cachet, an ever growing number of willing women armed with their catalogues and lipsticks, ready to take on the world.Every woman knows that beauty is a weapon, le is a battle and the right lippie can make you feel set to make men fall at your feet en route to world domination.The Avon lady is like a feminist warrior, bonding with women over cosmetics, generating debate and empowering women to look, feel and live better.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularVeteran DUP man: I’m happy with loyalist protests – even illegal onesSam McBride: Don’t assume Edwin Poots is more hardline than Sir Jeffrey Donaldson – the truth is more nuancedNI man dies after falling into riverIRA tributes from US and Corbynite figures ‘romantic nonsense’Sam McBride: From his s, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was seen as a future unionist leader – now might be his final chanceMost PopularNorthern Ireland Centenary rose proves a thorn in the side for Sinn FeinSam McBride: Is stolen Northern Bank cash in politics  Alarmingly, no one seems botheredPeter Robinson: Unionists have an interest in DUP leadership contest so the candidates should address this wider audienceMuslim convert who travelled to Syria during conflict cleared to enter NICouncillor: I took part in illegal UVF UDA-linked parade – and I don’t care                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommendedPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Nisha said the -year-old, who had worked in travel and tourism and lived in Bahrain, recently retired and moved back home to live in Bangalore in southern India.Sadly, he contracted coronavirus in March and was hospitalised. Dr Satyavir SinghalSpeaking from her home in south Belfast, Nisha said: “The care in the ICU wasn’t the care which one would have expected.- even in the private hospitals.”She said her sister had paid a “phenomenal amount of money” for his treatment, but added, “nothing could save him.”“It was a terrible situation. The poor girlhad to go through hell. “Even to get the death certicate and to get the paperwork sorted out has been a nightmare for her. “The funeral she had to do all by herself - there was nobody there.”Nisha Tandon is the founder and director of award-winning ethnic arts organisation, ArtsEkta and the creative force behind the Belfast Mela: an international showcase of music, dance, art, and food from more than  nations around the globe, held every summer in Belfast’s Botanic Gardens. She was also the driving force behind the development of the Indian Community Centre in Belfast and in  was awarded an OBE for services to the minority sector. Originally from New Delhi, she came to Northern Ireland in  as a young bride in an arranged marriage to Vijay, whose family first settled here in the s.Nisha said watching the television coverage of the pandemic sweep her native home is “just heartbreaking.”“Being so far away you cannot really do anything. The only support you can give is moral support by a phone call or by emails or video calls.“My entire family is in India. I am the only one who is here from my maternal side. From my father’s side I have cousins who are living in Birmingham.“It is very scary. We keep in touch with every single member of the family the older generation, we need to really worry about. There are so many cousins who are isolating and my aunties and uncles are isolating. “It is a dire situation and the aftermath is going to be even worse than it is now. There are going to be a lot of children who will be left with no parents and a lot of fathers will be left with no sons and a lot of sons will be left with no fathers. Especially in the very remote villages where it has reached and obviously in cities you can see what is happening they are showing it on every single news.“People are helpless - we saw it here and our hearts broke, while our systems here are much more robust. When you see the systems over thereyour heart breaks.”Nisha added there have been a lot of deaths in the Indian community in Northern Ireland due to Covid, but these have not been widely reported on. ArtsEkta has teamed up with the Isha Foundation to help raise funds for the devastating impact of Covid  in India. “It is a really, really bad situation in India and we have started to do a little bit of fundraising. “Whatever anyone can give, every little will help. It will go to the people who need support.

Isha-Europe-Corona-ReliefSusan Gillenlives in Jordanstown and tries to avoid watching television coverage of the pandemic in India.“It is so distressing, it’s like a horror film,” she said. Susan’s anguish is compounded by the fact her -year-old father, Dr John Mathai, is currently “trapped” in Kerala. “My father was a consultant geriatrician in Northern Ireland for many years and when he retired in  he went to live in London. “The whole year of isolation in London made him decide he would go to India for the winter. He left in November and he was due to come back on St Patrick’s Day, but because of his age he didn’t feel he would survive the quarantine when he ed to London, so he decided to stay on in India. “Obviously he wants to come back, but who knows when that is going to happen now with India on the red list for travel. We can’t get out to visit there, which is frustrating and upsetting. What can you do from so far away ”Susan FaceTimes her father quite often and said he is “quite calm and collected” about the situation.“He’s also quite circumspect about not travelling around or meeting too many people - he’s sensible. He’s not in a high state of fright or distress, but he’s very upset watching the other states, like the Punjab, which are in a really terrible way.”The Mathai family have many relatives in the state of Kerala, but Susan said thankfully none of them has died or become very unwell from Covid. “There are a lot of cases in Kerala at the moment, but they seem to have enough oxygen supplies and were better prepared than a lot of other states.”But, she believes the crisis across India has been “terribly mismanaged”.“Indian weddings, religious festivals involving huge gatherings and raucous election rallies involving crowds were all permitted to take place just before the second wave There doesn’t seem to have been measures put in place in the event of a second wave - the feeling was that they had survived the first one, so it didn’t seem to have been a big priority for the governments,”She added:“India was producing vaccines for the whole world and now it’s an embarrassing situation where they are having to rely on foreign aid to pull them out of this hole which they didn’t really have to be inthey had been prepared.”Dr Satyavir Singhal BEM, a consultant anaesthetist with the Belfast Trust, moved from Delhi to Northern Ireland  years ago. Now living in Newtownabbey, he has been watching the coverage of the horric devastation Covid- is causing in his homeland and, naturally, worries about his relatives there. “Sitting here you feel absolutely heartbroken and helpless. There is not a single member of the family who has been spared. Two who were caught in the pandemic, one from my we’s side, her brother’s we - they couldn’t get a hospital bed, but we could buy an oxygen concentrator for her and medication, so she survived and she is out of the woods now.”Dr Singhal said the oxygen concentrator he bought for his sister-in-law would normally cost about £-, but he paid £,, because of a shortage. “My sister’s husband is still in the hospital and my classmate lost both his parents a day apart.”Dr Singhal said he and colleagues in Northern Ireland are liaising with the medical fraternity in India. “They are still learning and hopefully we can guide them in terms of our experience of treatments or in terms of finding a hospital bed.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
