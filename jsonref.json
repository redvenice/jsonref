Bright-yellow stripes are being applied to the pavement at now-familiar two-metre intervals outside the school’s three sets of gates, and over the next few days, these markers will appear in classrooms, too. In between, dedicated routes will be laid out to take children safely from the school gates to their classroom doors.These plans, orchestrated by Bonneville’s headteacher, Andrea Parker, were being rolled out as the school prepared to reopen its doors to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils in line with the latest government guidelines. Schools, colleges and nurseries across England welcomed more children and students from 1 June onwards – and headteachers like Parker are busy preparing to embrace a new way of learning.“For every headteacher, keeping children safe is going to be at the top of their priorities”, says Parker, who is also the lead headteacher for Jessop primary and Stockwell primary schools. “We began our preparations by sending out a survey to check the pulse of how teachers and parents were feeling about returning to school. From there, we were able to start modelling what we need to do to support our families, and help them to feel more confident in sending their children back.”Since lockdown, the school has continued to take in around 25 of its 420 pupils each day, split into smaller groups for safety – the children of key workers, those from vulnerable families, or with education, health and care plans in place. “We’ve been open every day during lockdown,” says Parker. “Staff members even volunteered to work through the holidays, which has been fantastic.”Meanwhile, those teachers who have remained at home have been working on providing the online resources parents need for home schooling. “Overnight, we’ve all had to completely change how we work on a day-to-day basis with no training and no transition period, and teachers have been working incredibly hard to achieve that,” she says.At the same time, Parker believes temporary home schooling can’t replace the benefits of schools-based education, especially when it comes to the transitions experienced by those children who will begin returning to school from 1 June.“Reception, year 1 and year 6 are all key milestones,” she says. “Younger children are in the early stages of their education, and we want to be there for them as they develop their reading and friendship groups, and simply learn how to learn.“At the other end of the spectrum, year 6 are about to go to secondary school. It’s a time when they celebrate their SATs and everything they’ve achieved and worked hard for.”The Bonneville school building, which dates back to 1905, is large and welcoming. When I visit, days before reopening, crafted cardboard models of sea animals hang from the ceilings, and children’s work covers every inch of spare space on the walls.With only a fraction of the school’s 420 pupils in attendance – including Parker’s own six-year-old daughter, who is in school as the child of a key worker – the sound of children’s laughter, which usually fills these hallways, can only faintly be heard drifting in from the playground.“Our teachers are very excited and as desperate to see the children as I am,” she says. “They’re anxious, too, but going through our risk assessments with them has helped a lot.“With fewer children coming back to start with, we don’t need everybody to be here, which means those who are very anxious can be asked to come back later on. Hopefully they’ll see how things are working and their confidence will build – some people just need that, much like the parents who need to have a choice.”Home schooling for those children who remain at home will continue to be supported by teachers, but to reassure those who do send their children in, a raft of safety measures has been put in place.At the school gates, parents are required to socially distance from each other (guided by those painted stripes) during staggered drop-offs. “Bubbles” of up to 15 children will be dropped off together, with an allocated “bubble lead” – the class teacher – taking students into the building in shifts.Before entering their classroom, they sanitise their hands before being allocated a desk each for taking lessons, watching pre-recorded assemblies, and eating lunch, which will be delivered at the door. Outside space will be utilised for lessons as much as possible, while playtime and PE will be enjoyed within the children’s inidual groups.“Although younger children will be in smaller groups, it’s not just about the size of each bubble – it’s about dynamics as well,” says Parker. “Children are people with their own personalities and their own way of being, so we have to make sure each one is a manageable group and dynamic.”Extra hygiene measures include specific play and sports equipment allocated to each bubble, regular handwashing, staggered bathroom breaks followed by janitor cleaning, and early closing on Friday afternoons for deep-cleaning sessions. The early Friday closure will also be used to facilitate statutory planning and preparation time for teachers. The school has also drawn up sets of principles that parents, teachers and children will be asked to adhere to.For staff, these include having an awareness of each other – for example, no more than two teachers in the staffroom at a time. For children, the principles include reinforcing the NHS’s Catch it, Bin it, Kill it messaging. For parents, coming to collect children as quickly as possible if they fall ill.Bonneville has also worked to tailor specific solutions to the erse community the school serves. “In terms of the country Lambeth is hugely erse”, says Parker, citing the borough’s significant Caribbean, African and Asian communities, as well as pupils from Spanish-, French- and Portuguese-speaking backgrounds.“We know that the BAME community have surfaced as being prone to having a higher rate of infection”, says Parker, explaining that the school’s risk assessment process is being developed with the heightened vulnerability of BAME students, staff and their wider community in mind.Communicating to children why their schools have changed is a crucial part of helping them adapt to their new regimes, so Parker plans to share a virtual tour of the new school layout with pupils, and plug lessons about the roles of key workers into the curriculum.Parker’s plans have focused on building confidence among children, staff and parents, and communicating with them every step of the way. “It’s about trying to adapt, even though we don’t know how long we’re going to be adapting for,” she says.Check with your Local Authority for the latest news on schools opening in your area.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Clothing and beauty sales improved slightly on April, as people left their homes to meet outside with friends and family.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb1c8ea333cfa2fa559335df17215d027eb25dc6/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=d6e3c2302bbea7d954dba3060d67d0e9","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of union","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘union’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘union’.Share your photos of what union means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 10 June at 10am.

Our curriculum should not be reinforcing the message that a sizeable part of the British population are not valued.”Campaigners want black history to be included in the national curriculum from key stage 1 in primary through to key stage 4 when students take their GCSEs, and across subjects including history, citizenship, English and PSHE (personal, social, health and economic education).Lavinya Stennett, who founded the Black Curriculum, said: “There’s an appetite for change. People want to see the events of the past weeks lead to lasting change. It’s something we’ve known is important for a long time. Finally people are listening.”Black history, including topics such as migration, belonging and empire, can be taught as part of the history and English curriculum in secondary schools, but\u0026nbspwhether pupils\u0026nbspget to study it depends on\u0026nbspthe exam board and modules chosen by schools.Another challenge is that academies, which are not controlled by local authorities, have greater freedoms and are not required to follow the national curriculum, meaning many children may miss out on opportunities to study black history.Labour has promised that pupils will be taught about injustice and the role of the British empire as part of the national curriculum if it wins power.Black history is also studied and celebrated in Black History Month every October.Rosamund McNeil, the assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Government needs to be more proactive. It’s time to show leadership on making the curriculum\u0026nbspmore erse and more representative. It’s really helpful we have Black History Month in October, but it’s not enough to just do it in one month. We have to ask ourselves why we are not eliminating racism quickly enough.”Catherine West, the Labour MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, has also written to Williamson calling for a review on the issue. She said she had been contacted by hundreds of her constituents complaining about the “complete lack of BAME history” in the curriculum and the ineffectiveness of the education system in tackling systemic racism.“Whilst changing our education system will not necessarily bring an end to racism in the UK, I firmly believe this is an important step in beginning the process of ensuring racial equity in the UK and will go some way to tackling the issues which have been so widely discussed in the past few days,” West said.Pran Patel, an education consultant who runs a campaign to decolonise the school curriculum, said that in the last few days views of his website had risen from 500 a day to 6,000.He said: “Through no fault of their own, our curriculum leaves one group of children feeling inferior and another group with a sense of superiority. Black children don’t see themselves reflected back, and end up feeling they can’t be the person they see in the inspiring story.”Shaminder Takhar, an associate professor of sociology at London South Bank University, said: “Decolonising the curriculum gives voice to those who have previously been marginalised. Viewed in the context of anti-racist struggles such as BLM in the time of Covid-19, it highlights hierarchy and inequality. It is a move towards a more inclusive society.”It comes as a new art education project, backed by Turner-prize nominated artist Yinka Shonibare, is aiming to transform how Britain understands its role in the transatlantic slave trade by placing sculptures that explore its legacy in UK cities.The World Reimagined project will see 100 globe-shaped sculptures erected in cities across the UK in the summer of 2022, which will be accessible to local schools, and created by well-known and community-based artists.Founding board member, singer and former EastEnders star, Michelle Gayle, told the  she wanted to create a project that would start conversations about Britain and slavery, and provide an educational element for school and community groups. “It’s a cog in the wheel of what we need to learn about the truth of British history. Everyone can get involved, meaningfully,” she said.Gayle said the removal of the statue of the Bristolian slave trader Edward Colston on Sunday made her realise now was the right time to launch the project. “A lot of people were telling us that Britons are not ready to have this conversation,” she said.“Then the statue went down yesterday, and we heard people saying they were not taught enough about slavery. To see hear people talk about it like that made us realise that the difficult conversations are being had now.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Racism in all its forms is abhorrent and has no place in our society. Schools already play a significant role in teaching children about the importance of having respect and tolerance for all cultures.“Black history is an important topic which schools can teach to children of all ages as part of the history curriculum.\u0026nbspSchools can utilise resources from a range of organisations and sources to support teaching black history, including the Black Curriculum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e8ff2c9649a74d83026a4fcd85a101291f9228d/0_128_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcab8fb12527cec2733368fd763bed3e","title":"lockdown graduates students on finishing their degrees at home","story":"The Covid-19 pandemic has altered graduation plans, with ceremonies postponed or replaced by virtual eventsAt this time of year, it’s the custom for final year students at the University of Birmingham to have their picture taken holding their dissertation in front of Old Joe, the red brick clock tower in the centre of campus. But Nathan Clarke, who recently finished his history degree, missed the photo opportunity when the coronavirus lockdown began. “Campus was shut before I was able to hand in,” he says. “I had to hand in my thesis online and was robbed of an Instagram post.”Like many of the class of 2020, Clarke’s graduation ceremony has been cancelled and replaced by a virtual event. “The end of university has been anticlimactic,” he says. “Not being able to celebrate is a great shame – particularly for my mum, who had already picked out her dress.”As term draws to a close, graduation ceremonies across the UK have been cancelled or postponed to the disappointment of students’ families. “I was the first person in my family to attend university and it was a big deal for my grandma, in particular, to see me in my gown,” says Kelly Williamson, who studies at Edinburgh Napier University.“We’d already paid for a hotel, so that added stress to the situation. My family members have some long-term health conditions so I don’t know if they will be well enough to attend the next ceremonies that go ahead.”Ruth, who studies Chinese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, regrets losing the chance to say goodbye to her friends. “My ceremony has been postponed, but there will be a virtual ceremony this year. The gown hire company offered to post a cap and gown to my address to ‘celebrate your achievement at home’ –\u0026nbspbut my mum wants to attend an actual ceremony, so I’ll wait. I wouldn’t have minded missing it because it’s expensive, but it would be amazing to see all my classmates one last time – especially the international students who had to fly home.”Some students are still isolating on campus. Ruby Forrester, an English literature and religious studies student at Cardiff University, has stayed in the city with her housemates because she suffers from asthma and her parents work for the NHS. “Two of my housemates also stayed in Cardiff with me, which was a saving grace. We celebrated my housemate’s 21st by turning our bedrooms into fake bars and going on a bar crawl through the house,” she says.The lockdown has also disrupted assessments, with students forced to write dissertations away from libraries and to sit exams online. Bill Bowkett, who studies politics at the University of Kent, says his exams have been rearranged into 48-hour open-book essays to ensure students graduate on time.But Bowkett says the system is flawed. “I see why they have done them, but when exams are open-book, they are no longer exams. The level playing field has been lost. I am never guaranteed a quiet space at home, with seven people in total. My siblings are out of school and my parents are working from home. Not everyone has access to a reliable internet connection or technology that will enable them to access online resources. It will be those who are the most economically disadvantaged who will suffer the most.”For students like Ashling Sugrue, whose film and television degree at the London College of Communication includes practical work, the transition has been more complicated. “The crowning achievement of our course’s graduates is a short film. The lockdown hit on the exact week we were supposed to fly out to Spain for the shoot. Now nobody in the year has that calling card that the short film was supposed to be, so we’re all anxious about how we’re going to find work once the lockdown has ended. I’ve pictured my graduation so often and strove to get the best grades so I could really relish the feeling. Now I guess I’m getting my diploma in the mail instead.”Among the biggest concerns for this year’s cohort are their future job prospects the Bank of England’s chief economist has warned of a significant increase in unemployment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. Conor O’Brien, a history and American studies student at the University of Manchester, is worried by the impact of the pandemic on his ability to find work after graduating. “I feel the inequalities of the job market will only be exacerbated,” O’Brien says. “The pandemic has shown the cracks within British society and only a radical overhaul will prevent millions of young people like me from becoming victims of a different type.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c2607799e982bf8f97996089410d3670eca1304/0_98_2598_1559/master/2598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=833d79fda94ab733eac143891be5a43e","title":"plans to reopen english primary schools before summer in disarray","story":"Government sources acknowledge practicalities too difficult for all children to returnPlans to push ahead with reopening schools in England are in disarray, after the government admitted that not all primary school pupils will be able to return to the classroom before the end of summer.Boris Johnson last month said his aim was “to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages,” as he announced the opening of primary schools to pupils in reception, year one and year six from 1 June.But government sources now acknowledge that – with little more than six weeks remaining before schools close for summer – the practicalities are too difficult for all children to return.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is to give an update on the progress of schools reopening on Tuesday, and is expected to concede publicly that many primary pupils will not return to their classrooms until the new school year in autumn.The acknowledgement was welcomed by school leaders, with Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, saying: “If confirmed, we’re pleased to see the government will not force the impossible. Schools will continue to use their flexibility, intelligently, to deliver the very best for all the pupils in their school.”Attendance statistics collected by the Department for Education to be published on Tuesday are likely to confirm that only half of pupils in the three eligible year groups returned to school last week.The attendance figures represent a setback for Johnson’s efforts to use schools as a lever to revive the economy. Johnson’s “roadmap” for exiting the lockdown, published last month, stated: “The government’s ambition is for all primary school children to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible, though this will be kept under review.”But Johnson’s announcement of a 1 June return was greeted with scepticism by parents and opposition from school unions and local authorities, wary of the health and safety difficulties for both staff and pupils in England’s ageing and cramped classrooms.Whiteman, who represents leaders in the majority of England’s primary schools, said: “Throughout lockdown, school leaders and their teams have worked hard to meet the needs of all their pupils. This term, they must be given flexibility they need to balance the needs of the pupils coming back and the children continuing to learn at home.“Returning all pupils before the end of this term will present unsolvable practical barriers if the hierarchies of control are to be maintained. Year groups have had to be split into groups of 15, using up other classrooms and occupying teachers from other years.”In a further confirmation of the difficulties that teachers face, Matt Hancock hinted at Monday’s Downing Street press briefing that even a full return in September may be difficult.Hancock said that for secondary schools, September was the “current working plan” but it would require “ingenuity”. Johnson has said he would like to see the 2-metre distancing rule altered, although Department for Education guidance already states that young children need not socially distance within the small groups, or “bubbles”, in which they are taught.Scotland and Northern Ireland have already said that their schools will not reopen more widely until after the summer holidays, with Scotland saying that schools will use a flexible mix of in-person and remote learning for the foreseeable future. Schools in Wales are to partially reopen later this month for a brief period.Schools in all parts of the UK have remained open for the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils, with many operating throughout the Easter and half-term holidays."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f1903cdd3af320ac27daa8557dbaa8f21c99119/0_197_7848_4709/master/7848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cbe0518779d026073c5c1bcfe41252a","title":"more masks than jellyfish coronavirus waste ends up in ocean","story":"A glut of discarded single-use masks and gloves is washing up on shorelines and littering the seabedConservationists have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could spark a surge in ocean pollution – adding to a glut of plastic waste that already threatens marine life – after finding disposable masks floating like jellyfish and waterlogged latex gloves scattered across seabeds.The French non-profit Opération Mer Propre, whose activities include regularly picking up litter along the Côte d’Azur, began sounding the alarm late last month.Divers had found what Joffrey Peltier of the organisation described as “Covid waste” – dozens of gloves, masks and bottles of hand sanitiser beneath the waves of the Mediterranean, mixed in with the usual litter of disposable cups and aluminium cans.\u0026nbspThe quantities of masks and gloves found were far from enormous, said Peltier. But he worried that the discovery hinted at a new kind of pollution, one set to become ubiquitous after millions around the world turned to single-use plastics to combat the coronavirus. “It’s the promise of pollution to come if nothing is done,” said Peltier.The group hopes the images will prompt people to embrace reusable masks and swap latex gloves for more frequent handwashing. “With all the alternatives, plastic isn’t the solution to protect us from Covid. That’s the message,” said Peltier.In the years leading up to the pandemic, environmentalists had warned of the threat posed to oceans and marine life by skyrocketing plastic pollution. As much as 13 million tonnes of plastic goes into oceans each year, according to a 2018 estimate by UN Environment. The Mediterranean sees 570,000 tonnes of plastic flow into it annually – an amount the WWF has described as equal to dumping 33,800 plastic bottles every minute into the sea.These figures risk growing substantially as countries around the world confront the coronavirus pandemic. Masks often contain plastics such as polypropylene, said Éric Pauget, a French politician whose region includes the Côte d’Azur.“With a life of 450 years, these masks are an ecological timebomb given their lasting environmental consequences for our planet,” he wrote last month in a letter to Emmanuel Macron, calling on the French president to do more to address the environmental consequences of disposable masks.Earlier this year the Hong Kong-based OceansAsia began voicing similar concerns, after a survey of marine debris in the city’s uninhabited Soko Islands turned up dozens of disposable masks.“On a beach about 100 metres long, we found about 70,” said Gary Stokes of OceansAsia. One week later, another 30 masks had washed up. “And that’s on an uninhabited island in the middle of nowhere.”Curious to see how far the masks had travelled, he began checking other nearby beaches. “We’re finding them everywhere,” he said. “Ever since society started wearing masks, the cause and effects are being seen on the beaches.”While some of the debris could be attributed to carelessness, he speculated that the lightweight masks were at times also being carried from land, boats and landfills by the wind.“It’s just another item of marine debris,” he said, likening the masks to plastic bags or straws that often wash up on the city’s more remote shorelines. “It’s no better, no worse, just another item we’re leaving as a legacy to the next generation.”\u0026nbspStill, given the likelihood that porpoises and dolphins in the region could mistake a mask for food, he was bracing himself for a grim find. “We’re constantly getting them washing up dead and we’re just waiting for a necropsy when we find a mask inside,” he said. “I think it’s inevitable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48e3b180db2b474f55305d6d1768fa825f7bb595/0_324_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e19de03cf95b7d84eedd1029635dcb82","title":"fashion shows weeks catwalk runways digital","story":"As catwalks go digital for who-knows-how-long, our fashion critic looks back on two decades of attending fashion weeks Fashion people love to exaggerate, but I have been to a lot of fashion shows – about 3,000, by according to my back-of-envelope maths. Mostly in London, Paris, Milan and New York, but also Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro, Berlin and Edinburgh, Marrakech and Reykjavik. Twenty years of pret-a-porter and haute-couture collections – two of each every year, give or take two maternity leave gaps, a bout of appendicitis and the time I messed up my US visa – adds up to a lot of catwalk time.But now, suddenly, the fashion show is over. No more impossibly beautiful people in ridiculously gorgeous (or just ridiculous) clothes. No more seating squabbles, no more front-row gossip, no more writing copy in the back of a minicab between shows. There are no real-life catwalks this season, with the first all-digital London fashion week kicking off on Friday, and online-only events scheduled for Paris and Milan next month. Most probably no physical shows for the rest of the year, with September’s fashion weeks looking unlikely. And after that, who knows? Will social distancing and recession kill the catwalk for ever?The squash and squeeze of fashion week makes watching football from my seat in the west stand at the Emirates look like a Glyndebourne picnic, and is at odds with new protocols about how we navigate each other. But long before the pandemic it was clear that fashion shows were out of control. Fashion weeks in cities throughout the world, brands presenting six or eight collections a year rather than two, with lavish production and international travel added up to an indefensibly large carbon footprint. If the combined impact of social distancing, travel restrictions and recession is that the fashion week is reinvented as a virtual moment, there will be much to celebrate in that.But I will really, really miss fashion shows. They have brought me so much joy. My entry to fashion week coincided with the moment the catwalk was evolving from its second half of the 20th-century form – a chic but rule-bound, elite, inward-focused parade that served a clique of editors and buyers – into a stadium-sized pop cultural carnival.The first fashion week I attended, as this paper’s new deputy fashion editor, was New York in September 1999. My trusty pre-Google paperback Dictionary of Fashion and Fashion Designers in no way prepared me to report on what I found. I remember Donatella Versace’s Versus show, where Madonna sat next to Rupert Everett on the front row – both in cowboy hats, I think – applauding Kate Moss as she strutted past us in white hot pants and gold boots. At Calvin Klein, Trish Goff wore a pencil skirt and plain fine-knit sweater with the sleeves pushed up and I had the feeling (one I have had many times since) of finally knowing exactly how I wanted to dress thereafter. Watching Naomi Campbell at Marc Jacobs, and that season’s new face – Gisele Bündchen – in a zebra-print bikini at Michael Kors, I was knocked out by the visceral power of the supermodel, goddess-made-flesh. And then there was a hurricane, and shows started getting cancelled. But the Alexander McQueen event went ahead, even though it took place on a pier in the Hudson.Around the time of the millennium, McQueen was at the forefront of reinventing fashion as theatre. His rival for fashion’s attention was John Galliano, who had begun turning Christian Dior Paris catwalks into psychedelic costume parades. McQueen and Galliano had very different aesthetics – Galliano vibrant and supersized, McQueen dark and lean – but both loved to shock their audiences.That night in New York, the models walked through a catwalk submerged in water. (Nothing to do with the hurricane, that was just the way that McQueen, with his uncanny instinct for the zeitgeist and apparently the weather, had planned the show.) After the model finale, a field of iron spikes rose up from the ground, their points skywards, and a troupe of dancers in burqa-like coverings pirouetted above them, suspended by silk ropes – an allusion to western fear of Islam that was made all the more unsettling when McQueen took his bow and dropped his baggy jeans on the catwalk to display stars-and-stripes boxer shorts. It was my first taste of the appetite-jolting salty-sweet lick of beauty and bombshell that a fashion week can be, and I was blown away. I suspect my reports were hopelessly breathless. I remember being halfway through reading one down the phone to the office in London, when the copytaker interrupted me, not unkindly, to ask: “Is there much more, love?” before sighing and audibly lighting another cigarette.Fashion shows are as much about drama as they are about clothes. I have admired hundreds of perfect bouclé\u0026nbsptweed suits, but the Chanel shows I will never forget are those staged in a giant supermarket where Rihanna pushed Cara Delevingne down the soft-drink aisle in a shopping trolley, the one where a space rocket launched during the finale – and the one where a voice informed us just before the show that M Lagerfeld was indisposed, and would not be attending that morning. He was 85, and had never missed one of his own shows before that a month later, he was dead.There is a special thrill in the expectant wait for a debut show to begin – Raf Simons at Dior, where the atelier was wallpapered with thousands of fresh blooms Nicolas Ghesquière at Louis Vuitton, where an earnest note from the designer was on every seat Lindsay Lohan at Emanuel Ungaro – of which, well, the less said the better. There is the camp, Strictly-final emotion of a farewell show. (After two decades of these I can tell you that nobody blinks back tears as prettily, in immaculate black tie and with a poignant half smile, as Tom Ford.)On stage at Sadler’s Wells in 2000, Hussein Chalayan transformed chairs into dresses and a coffee table into a hooped skirt. When Marc Jacobs was at Louis Vuitton, a courtyard of the Louvre was decked out as a belle époque railway station, and we sat on benches waiting for the show to begin. Then a real train trundled down the tracks and the models got out of it. That was eight years ago, and I still wonder how they did it.In 2007, Prince got up out of his front row seat at Matthew Williamson and did a set on the catwalk. In 2018, the actual Queen turned up at London fashion week. And yet for all the hoopla, some of the most perfect fashion moments have been those shows that are pure, old-school chic. Christian Lacroix’s catwalk shows in Paris, when a red rose was left on every seat and his seamstresses cheered from the back rows. Yves Saint Laurent’s final shows before his retirement, the audience squished on to tiny benches but thrilled to be there, the elegance austere and intoxicating as cold vodka. In recent seasons, The Row have conjured that same chic mood at their sublime New York fashion shows.There are cultural issues with fashion shows that run deeper than the logistics of social distancing and are as problematic, in their own way, as the events’ carbon footprint. Whether you look on the catwalk or the front row, or at the Instagram influencers, the world view of fashion weeks skews sharply towards skinny white women. There is still a huge amount of work to be done on ersity, not just on model casting but in ensuring that people of colour are represented within brands’ creative teams, and in audiences. There are still too few women at decision-making level within the fashion business. However, it is not true that fashion shows have nothing interesting to say. Jean Paul Gaultier was challenging gender stereotypes on the haute-couture catwalk back in 2002. Raf Simons used his debut at Calvin Klein in February 2017 to challenge Trump culture with a homage to an alternative vision of Americana. Maria Grazia Chiuri’s Christian Dior shows have consistently placed feminism at the forefront of fashion-week conversation. Vivienne Westwood has made London fashion week a platform for climate activism. At New York fashion week, Pyer Moss designer Kerby Jean-Raymond has shown the power of being both an activist and a designer. In 2016, his collection was accompanied by the screening of a powerful film about police brutality against people of colour.Just as even a top-flight sports match is not the same when played without fans, fashion week will be very different without a live audience. The synchronised intake of breath that would sweep around the Tennis Club in Paris during a Phoebe Philo Celine show on first view of a particularly delicious polo neck. The camaraderie and hysteria that builds over the course of a month on the road. The time Anna Wintour jumped up and led a standing ovation for McQueen’s They Shoot Horses Don’t They? The backstage scrum to get close to a designer for a quote, which is usually mumbled or Delphic or both. (One season, I thought Miuccia Prada said her collection was about moccasins and another broadsheet fashion editor thought she had said it was about democracy either was equally believable.) I will even miss people unfathomably bursting into tears at Comme des Garçons. All of this has been, frankly, a blast.But fashion must move with the times, Otherwise it’s not fashion. The catwalk has reinvented itself a hundred times over, swapping ballgowns for streetwear, ditching stuffy salon shows in favour of popcorny clickbait. Digital is how we live now – so that’s where the fashion show needs to live, too. The catwalk has a fabulous history, but fashion is about the future. So I’ll be binge-watching the next season of fashion from here, at home on my laptop. And I can’t wait."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3342bd8ccf2c08c84b6057826b6fe5b11018316/198_0_1616_970/master/1616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a55bc3e3366e6bcec80fe7eb580edb39","title":"my streaming gem why you should watch creep","story":"The latest in our series of writers highlighting under-appreciated films is a recommendation for an atmospheric found footage horror Is there anything creepier than someone who’s just a little too friendly? Think about the stranger who tries to chit-chat on the Tube, the colleague who stands too close, or the friend’s unblinking new partner who tells you about the risen Christ over a carbonara. That frightening line between sociable and sociopath is one that Creep plays with to thrilling effect throughout every second of its 80-minute runtime. It’s short but not sweet.Duplass, who also co-wrote the movie with Brice, has the comfortingly familiar face of a man you shared a house with at university but haven’t seen in 10 years and uses it to continually lull you into a false sense of security that you can’t even be sure is false. It’s a charismatic study in unpredictability. One minute he’s funny and charming, the next he’s making you film him in the bath, and the next he’s taking a practical joke too far. If there was ever a personality trait that’s an indicator of potential psychopathy, it’s an overzealous practical joker. They don’t want you to laugh, they want you to cry.\u0026nbspAaron never cries but we do share his growing unease as the drip, drip of cumulative dread gradually pools at the base of his mind, insistent but just about ignorable. It’s easy to scoff at Aaron’s apparent naivety for driving into the woods to meet a total stranger and for ignoring what seem like red flags, but when you actually think about it, you start to see how plausible his predicament really is. In real life, if you saw an axe in a tree stump outside a house in the woods, as Aaron does at the beginning, you wouldn’t immediately think a murderer lives inside. When you see a shadow you don’t assume it’s a ghost. And once you’ve met the person and established rapport, it then becomes virtually impossible, even if you have suspicions, to confront them or run away. You might be wrong and the fear of social embarrassment is sometimes a more powerful force than the urge for self-preservation. No one ever really thinks that the weirdo is actually going to kill them. And the chances are, they won’t. There’s one moment, after several more fairly major warning signs, where Josef, silhouette in the darkness, stands ominously at the top of the steep steps leading to his house and tries to persuade Aaron to come inside for “one drink”. You’re screaming at him to say no but no is a hard word to say unless you’re absolutely certain being rude is the only option.\u0026nbspMade by Blumhouse – the company that also produced Paranormal Activity – Creep has their distinctive low-budget minimalist feel that works so well for horror. A lot of genre film-makers lazily assume that violence and gore will scare people the most but it never seems to work that way. Atmosphere, dread and the power of suggestion are much more disturbing and this underseen movie deftly uses all three to palm-sweating effect. It feels grounded in reality by refusing to go over the top. Like in many of Duplass’s movies, the dialogue is in large part improvised and the authenticity this gives it really does make it uncommonly believable. One or two all too easy wrong turns and Aaron could be you. The troubling question that lingers long after the film is: how would I react? Would you really heed the supposed warning signs or would you in fact be polite and go inside for that “one drink”? After all, kindness costs nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b84b1de28e3c673341e07658a02391743ff91f73/422_164_2346_1408/master/2346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc83feeae9c55b09fe3350907914223","title":"hands off 10 deliciously selfish cupcake recipes","story":"A lavish sugar hit that you don’t have to share? No wonder cupcakes are having a moment. These easy bakes will see you through from breakfast to dessertNo, you’re not reading an article from the year 2000.

Confectionery can do that, unlike other unsavoury sensations from 20 years ago such as Von Dutch truck driver\u0026nbsphats, alcopops and R Kelly. You can argue about good taste, but you can’t argue with what tastes good.The cupcake’s return makes absolute sense during the pandemic: not only are we baking more, but after nearly 11 weeks in lockdown, we’re also ready for the heady decadence of a cake that we don’t have to share, is full of heretofore elusive ingredients and offers sugar hits in spades.From\u0026nbsptraybakes\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspstorecupboard staples\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspmissing-ingredient bakes, we have been doing some pretty worthy cooking recently.

Before their bigger, snazzier US counterparts invaded British shores, fairy cakes decorated children’s party tables across the land alongside iced gems and crisps. Felicity Cloake’s perfect fairy cakes capture their understated charm: a light vanilla sponge with a basic icing-sugar-and-water glaze and a smattering of hundreds and thousands.\u0026nbspThe aforementioned American invasion was the result of Sex and the City’s third series, in which\u0026nbspCarrie and Miranda discussed the former’s most recent crush over\u0026nbsppink-iced vanilla cupcakes\u0026nbspfrom the Magnolia bakery. The Bleecker St eatery became an institution, featuring in NYC’s SATC tour, and inspired the opening of equivalent bakeries across the world, such as the Hummingbird in London. And the cupcake took off.Nigella is rarely one to miss a trend, although she somehow always dodges the bandwagon.\u0026nbspShe embraced cupcake fever in 1998 when her second book, the baking bible How to Be a Domestic Goddess came out, with these chocolate cherry cupcakes\u0026nbspon the cover. They’re rich and indulgent, as a cupcake should be, elevated beyond sickly sweetness with tart cherry jam and refined still more with a ganache icing.\u0026nbspYou will never have to inidually bake for a multitude of dietary requirements again with this one-size-fits-all cake. After 17 attempts at nailing a\u0026nbspcupcake that excluded gluten, dairy and egg, the writer Susannah Booth came up with this chocolate number. And vegan cake – or any cake to accommodate intolerances – isn’t just for those who abstain from some ingredients. Meera Sodha’s zingy\u0026nbspblood orange and polenta cakes\u0026nbsp(one for winter, but you could substitute the blood orange for almost any available citrus) and\u0026nbspLily Vanilli’s ultimate vegan cake\u0026nbspare both testament.Suddenly, summer fruit is upon us.

Especially when you have preoccupations tugging at your attention. In fact, maybe “tugging” is a better word to describe the mussel task tugging the wispy beard that pokes out of the shell – like a coat stuck in a car door – the bundle of threads created by mussels in order to attach to a solid surface, a rock, a quayside, pier-leg.As a child, I remember being terrified by the clusters of mussels clinging like wild necklaces to the legs of the pier in Brittany. I would choose to swim 100m back through ink and shadows, alone, rather than climbing up and over the black-blue shells with the others. I also remember eating mussels on that holiday, opening the hinged shells to find an orange ear, being unsettled and delighted by the texture and pool of liquor, by the woman on the next table who got “a bad one” and was sick into her bag, neatly, which I thought was impressive. Even more impressive was how she left, came back to the table, dismissed any concern, and had a glass of champagne.Memories follow you, as does advice, such as that given to me by a young man collecting mussels from rocks in Puglia: “Unless you are getting them from me, play safe and get your mussels from a fishmonger – but do get them, and eat them with rice.” While they may not have the alluring flavour of wild ones, farmed mussels are still plump parcels of flavour. They are also safe, abundant and not expensive: a fish we should be eating.Like the mussel collector straddling two rocks, today’s recipe comes from the heel of Italy, Puglia, and is in the spirit of the classic tiella di riso, patate e cozze, but a simpler stovetop version of just rice and mussels. The glory of mussels is twofold: as well as the flesh, they provide briny liquor – an incomparable seasoning.The original recipe, in Le Ricette Regionali Italiane, suggests stirring a spoonful of grated pecorino into the rice and mussels before serving, which, like the Roman habit of mixing pasta, mussels and pecorino, flies in the face of the idea that cheese and fish don’t make good partners – they do, the cheese acting as a rounded seasoning and also culinary adhesion, bringing the dish together. All that said, it is best to give people a choice. Pass round grated pecorino separately also red chilli flakes, a few of which tug the dish together.1kg musselsOlive oil100ml white wine1 garlic clove300g ripe tomatoes, peeled or tinned tomatoes, without juice260g risotto rice (arborio or carnaroli)1 heaped tbsp chopped parsleyBlack pepperPecorino, gratedRed chilli flakes, to serveFirst, soak the mussels in cold water for 30 minutes, then scrub them under running water, scraping away barnacles and pulling away the hairy beards. Discard any with broken shells.Put the mussels in a large, deep frying pan or saucepan over a medium-high flame with one tablespoon of olive oil and 100ml white wine, cover and cook for a few minutes, shaking the pan every so often. Once the shells start to open, remove the lid and use a slotted spoon to lift them out and into a bowl. Strain the liquor into another bowl and add enough hot, lightly salted water to make it up to 800ml. Pick three-quarters of the mussels from their shells, but leave the rest in for show.Wipe the pan clean, put it back on the heat with four tablespoons of olive oil and a clove of garlic, and, after a minute, add the tomatoes and a pinch of salt, and cook for 10 minutes, mashing them with a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon.Add the rice and stir, then add the mussel liquor and cook, stirring often, for 17 minutes, or until the rice is tender: add more water if it is looking dry - the consistency should be rippling, but not stiff. In the last few minutes of cooking, add the mussels (both on and off shell), parsley, a few grinds of black pepper and stir again. Serve, passing round grated pecorino or red chilli flakes for those who want them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cc36d7659be67131a159f997375bf48ff337924/0_3961_5683_3410/master/5683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=363cc193e0a5f51425dcc2a2855a11f2","title":"thomasina miers recipe for baked spiced rice","story":"A Mediterranean one-pot summer treat for easy cooking and even easier clearing upThe one downside of cooking at home more is the washing up – piles of it.

James Milner’s incredible goalline clearance at Anfield feels a lifetime ago but there were some green shoots despite a dispiriting defeat to Liverpool that in many ways was symptomatic of Bournemouth’s season to date. Unsettled from the moment Steve Cook was forced off through injury, within 15 minutes Liverpool had turned the tables after seizing on sloppy mistakes. But Eddie Howe was understandably encouraged by the manner in which his side threatened, finding joy on the counterattack and they would have equalised through Ryan Fraser but for Milner’s intervention.A week earlier, they had Chelsea on the ropes but failed to eke out victory. Bournemouth\u0026nbsphave never been so ensconced in a Premier League relegation battle with nine games to go and, as Howe knows, there is little margin for error when they return.What about now? Finally, Bournemouth can unleash David Brooks after an injury-plagued 12 months for the winger who has twice undergone surgery because of an ankle complaint. Meanwhile Lloyd Kelly, an exciting £13m arrival from Bristol City last summer, is primed for his first taste of Premier League action after being bogged down by ankle and thigh injuries. The treatment room is sparse compared to March, with Charlie Daniels, who is yet to return to training following knee surgery, set to be the only notable absentee when Crystal Palace visit next weekend. Howe feels this is the strongest squad he has assembled but, until now, there has inevitably been frustration at not being able to fully utilise it. The run-in is tricky, with trips to Wolves, Manchester City and Manchester United but Bournemouth should return with more oomph.What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? Getting a significant tune out of Ryan Fraser would be a major boon given he confessed to being sidetracked by transfer speculation for the first few months of the campaign.\u0026nbsp“I wasn’t myself, I didn’t play for the team. I’m honest enough to admit that,” he told the BBC in January.\u0026nbspNo Bournemouth player has made more top-flight appearances than the winger this season but his influence has undoubtedly waned. Fraser is set to depart on a free transfer this summer, seven years on from joining as a teenager from Aberdeen for £400,000, and one last hurrah would likely ensure a happy ending for all parties. Bournemouth yielded seven points from the last available nine at home and extending that form behind closed doors would be handy.Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? There has been one blemish – Jordon Ibe’s foolish decision to breach lockdown guidelines by inviting celebrity barber Nikky Okyere to cut his hair and then publicising his flouting of the rules on Instagram. He posted a since-deleted image of him wearing a mask and a gown that carried the stylist’s rather apt slogan: “Breaking The Rules \u0026amp Changing The Game”. Bournemouth launched an investigation and Ibe released a grovelling apology.\u0026nbspThe 24-year-old, who arrived at Bournemouth from Liverpool in 2016 for a then club-record £15m, has been training with the under-21s since December.Any unsungcommunity heroes? Howe became the first Premier League manager to take a voluntary pay cut amid the coronavirus crisis, while the squad donated a six-figure sum to Bournemouth Churches Housing Association, which supports victims of domestic abuse. Several players and staff contacted vulnerable and isolated supporters. Adam Smith, who was born in east London, donated 10 iPads to Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow to enable Covid-19 patients to communicate with their families via FaceTime. The club is also considering bearing a message to key workers on their shirts for the remainder of the season after ending its sponsorship deal with betting company M88.Key player in the run-in? Jefferson Lerma – the lungs of the team. The combative midfielder is walking a disciplinary tightrope given he is a yellow card away from a two-match suspension, but Bournemouth need him to make his presence felt. His reputation as the team’s bouncer sometimes precedes him but there is more to Lerma than firefighting and putting his head in where it hurts.End-of-season-prediction Things do not get any easier for Bournemouth but they have a useful tendency of raising their game when it really matters: 17th."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fce002109bb1186d172e2f6de4d655dc6f625e32/0_63_2300_1379/master/2300.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7475489c7d6b63e54ccddff415c03c44","title":"how we met i told him id always been taught to keep my pants on","story":"Rachel Hirst, 46, and Andrew Knapper, 55, met on the top of Ben Lomond in Scotland in 2005. They live in Glasgow with their two boysAndrew Knapper moved to the UK from Canada in January 2005 for a temporary contract, but never expected to stay. “I was based in Stirling in Scotland for a nine-month role in management consultancy,” he says. One Sunday that summer, he and a friend decided to go for a hike up Ben Lomond. He didn’t know it at the time, but Rachel Hirst wasn’t far behind. “It was one of those rare sunny days in Scotland, so I thought I’d go for a walk before getting on with some work,” she says. When she got to the top, she found herself sitting near Andrew.\u0026nbsp“I was wearing my rain trousers that day as it had been cloudy in the morning,” he says.\u0026nbsp“But, as a Canadian, I have always called them pants. I was talking to my friend about whether I would need to wear them on the way down.” Rachel found it hilarious. “I overheard him ask his friend if he should take his pants off and I burst out laughing. I told him, as a good English girl, I’d always been taught to keep my pants on.”They soon got chatting and Rachel joined Andrew and his friend on a different route back down the mountain. “It’s funny, because up until that point I had been very happy being single. But walking down that hill, I knew there was something there,” she says. “I asked if I could stand him a pint when we got to the bottom and he found that really funny.” After drinks at the pub, they exchanged numbers. “She texted me afterwards to say how much she’d enjoyed herself. She never did make it to the office that afternoon.”\u0026nbspThe following summer, Andrew began work in Belgium, returning to see Rachel in Glasgow every weekend. “Sometimes I would go and meet him in Amsterdam or Paris or Prague. We had lots of little adventures.” They moved in together in July 2007 and got married the following month in the Yorkshire Dales, where her family lived. Their first son was born in 2008. “He was a honeymoon baby, but he came early. I spent a lot of time reminding people he was early,” says Rachel, laughing. “Our second son was born in 2010.”\u0026nbspRachel works as an ecologist and Andrew has continued his work in consulting, across the UK and abroad. He went to Australia for a project in 2016, which she says was “really hard”. One of the nice things about lockdown is that they are able to spend more time together.\u0026nbspAndrew says that, while Rachel is beautiful and intelligent, they also have shared values. “She has a strong sense of what it means to be a family, which I have always appreciated, especially when I am far away from my home,” he says. For Rachel, it is her partner’s relaxed nature that makes their relationship work so well. “He’s never fazed by anything and he’s always prepared. When I am busy flapping, he keeps me in check.”When lockdown is over, the couple plan to spend more time travelling and exploring with their boys. “We’ve taken them to see Ben Lomond before, to see where we met,” says Rachel. “They call it our mountain. I love being able to tell them our story.”Want to share your story?

At the beginning of lockdown, we were told Shakespeare wrote King Lear while sheltering from a plague we were told we would eat, and eat again and we were told – many times – that life indoors would give us time to reflect.While isolation has not been positive or pleasant for many, it has led to some new discoveries, and rediscoveries. Here, writers share the lockdown habits they intend to keep.A few weeks into lockdown, when I was craving social interaction and desiring the kind of light, fun discussions about pop culture I’d normally have with friends at a pub, I threw out an idea on Instagram.I’d always wanted to initiate an “album club”. Just\u0026nbsplike a book club, but instead of reading something, the idea was we’d all listen to an album and talk about our favourite and least favourite tracks, the cringiest lines, the themes, and share gossip about the artist.Our first session on Zoom had more than a dozen participants from all over the world. Some members were old friends, and some I’d never met before. We spent nearly two hours talking about Dua Lipa’s Future Nostalgia, but also getting to know each other by swapping lockdown stories from our various cities and countries.It was an experiment, but it worked and everyone loved it. We made them weekly, talking Madonna, FKA Twigs and Billie Eilish.\u0026nbspWhen society started opening up again and people were no longer forced to video conference for human interaction, I felt a twinge of sadness that the album club might not have a place in a semi-normal world.But we’re going to try and make it last. I recommend everyone who loves music give it a try. It’s a fun excuse to hang out with your mates and talk about some bangers.Since lockdown started, my daily walks have become opportunities to feed my plant-lady lifestyle, by taking “fair game” cuttings from around my suburb. Plants overgrowing in parks or spilling over fences on to the footpath. I’ve begun filling a grubby tote with whatever I know will survive the chop.My most ambitious addition thus far has been a gutter rescue frangipani branch. Beginning with a few succulents, my magpie brain has lead me to fill every windowsill with old pesto jars, fostering the new cuttings before they’re ready to be planted. Found cuttings make great gifts and have brightened up my apartment in an affordable way. As long as you don’t damage the original plant, I think it’s a wonderful way to interact with, and benefit from your neighbourhood commons. Now I’ve transformed into a snipper – scouting Google Map’s “green zones” for my next addition – I don’t see myself stopping.Before lockdown, it was rare for my housemates and me to all be at home at the same time. We’d rarely hang out, despite being childhood friends and literally living within metres of each other.\u0026nbspNow our home offices have started to take shape, we’ve made a habit out of sharing meals and cooking for each other. We’ve introduced each other to new food and new recipes, and found ourselves coming together for house dinners every week or so sharing a few bottles of wine and showing our love through a home-cooked meal.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNot only have we been able to reconnect with each other and get to know everyone’s partners, we’ve also been reminded that the friendships worth nurturing are often the ones closest to home. As our lives return to normal, we’re planning on keeping house dinners in the diary.Doing the laundry used to be, at best, a grim and smelly hygienic necessity. However, under lockdown, it became an oasis in the otherwise drably-identical days as time lost all meaning and March gently turned into Flebuvember.\u0026nbspAfter decades of apartments and sharehouses I now have access to a back yard and an unshared washing line where I don’t have to fight for space. Somehow, the ritual of putting out washing became my little Covid-zen moment.\u0026nbspAs things start to loosen up, it’s still the highlight of my working-from-home day. I treasure the screenless minutes standing among green things, lorikeets and corellas screeching from fruit trees, reflecting with gratitude on how I’m not forced to work around the pungent, rain-soaked doona some other resident left on the line a week earlier.\u0026nbspLockdown has been the perfect opportunity to take the plunge, and let my hair grow out – and it’s been so liberating. It turns out the most grey my follicles have produced so far is a distinct tuft at the front, reminiscent of Lily from The Munsters, along with a few extras peppered here and there.I’m not alone. I’ve discovered thousands of women, of all ages, flocking to a “Growing Grey Gracefully” Facebook page for inspiration and courage. Behind the curtains of the pandemic, they’re sharing hair at various stages of skunk-like regrowth, many after years of colouring.\u0026nbspThen there’s the #greyhair Instagram craze.\u0026nbspNo one seems to have any regrets. It means no more regular trips to the hairdresser to hide the dreaded regrowth, no more chemicals and no more exorbitant fees. Freedom!\u0026nbspDenise CullenAs a forensic psychologist, I need to engage in continuing professional development to maintain registration. Mirroring the transition to remote client consultations through telehealth, the Australian Psychological Society brought lots of its training online. One night I might be participating in a webinar about differentiating child sexual abusers another night countering violent extremism the next conducting evaluations remotely.But to balance that up, I’ve also been doing some purely for fun stuff – Lauren Bath’s online photography course and Ivy Newport’s Flight and Feather encaustic art class.I love the flexibility of online learning – being able to sign in whenever it suits. It’s also more affordable than attending in-person training. A lot of the APS training was available at no cost while other online providers offered discounted classes. The informal networking opportunities aren’t the same online, but from a flexibility and cost point of view, it definitely trumps face to face.When the pandemic took hold, my gym closed and I started working from home, I worried about not being able to exercise and lethargy setting in. So I started a combination of walking, jogging and running around my suburb, so I didn’t feel like I’d just been sitting at my laptop all day.Now it’s something I can’t do without. I’m up to between 6-8km a day. I get through so many podcasts and I’ve discovered so much more of my local area. Parks, shops and restaurants that I never knew were there before.Gyms are reopening later this month, but I am hopeful I can keep this daily habit mixed in with regular workouts. The difficulty will be once the commute to the office returns – the laziness will set in again. Not to mention Melbourne’s winter.Seven days into lockdown it was clear I needed to take a Marie Kondo wand to social media. The content of my Instagram seemed especially off-kilter – 2,697 pages of blue French lace corsets or Costa Rican sunsets. Then it came to me – to start a fresh with a new page and only follow accounts that would help inspire and comfort. I decided 19 was as good a number as any.Music, comedy, self-care, art, creative minds, Covid-19 commentators, recipes and photojournalism were genres I needed. I did include one fashion page (a vintage dealer), but I was pretty disciplined. And it seems something has changed on Instagram too pre-pandemic the lasting sentiment after an Instagram deep e was FOMO or consumerism. Now my feed feels erse, but unifying. May this Instagram linger a while longer.If crises reveal – not change – us, what the coronavirus lockdown has done in our household is reveal the extent to which menu planning is awesome. I had always dabbled in weekly menu planning, getting a large shop and then mapping out the week’s dinners to allow for variety and limiting waste, but frequently, in the pre-times, this would be thrown off by life or the ability to pick up food at a whim.During coronavirus lockdown with our need to limit visits to the shops or deliveries, our badly-kept-to habit took on a new necessity. Taking 10 minutes out at the arrival of a grocery haul sounds tedious, but it meant our meals were more interesting, our food waste fell to zero and we spent about a quarter less on groceries than usual. This one, she’s a keeper.A boring thing to talk about is how you have finally discovered balance in lockdown. It is much cooler to talk about how you have used this time to learn how to balance on one foot, like a literal child.Two years ago, a physio told me to stand in front of her on one leg and then the other, and narrowed her eyes at me as I fell over immediately, twice. Mortifying.Now, with the freedom of working from home, I suddenly have time for the exercises I lied about doing for six months’ worth of paid consultations – and two months later, I can balance. Sometimes for a full minute, even 90 seconds sometimes holding on to my big toe and stretching my lifted leg out in front of me sometimes kicking it out straight behind me in a yoga pose that is meant to look graceful but in fact looks bad.The epic concentration required has the added bonus of completely shutting my mind down in a way I never quite managed with yoga. I pine for the days that I can loudly challenge my colleagues to a balance-off in the shared office kitchen. Until then I will settle for bragging about my dumb skill on a global news site.I know it’s something of a cardinal sin for a writer-by-trade to not really be a reader, but for the past few years, I’ve never really been able to find the time (or drive) to read books. Since I started writing and editing, my day-to-day has been a constant jumble of thinkpieces and corrections, news aggregation and email sending. By the time I clock off, there’s little I want to do less than read.Now, one of my lockdown joys is reading books again I re-read Melissa Broder’s The Pisces two weeks ago, and will probably finish Natasha Stagg’s Sleeveless tonight. I’ve got another two books lined up to read after that, and, even though restrictions are slowly lifting, I don’t think I’ll kick this habit too quickly. It seems obvious, but I’m finding that reading challenges me to sit with silence and helps build an attention  that’s been getting shorter and shorter.Most of all, reading provides a kind of true escapism, free of notifications and news updates. And nowadays that, above all, is what I crave most.\u0026nbspSometime in late February, well before lockdown, we were taught a simple way to stop the spread: don’t touch your face. As this super-cut of people touching their faces immediately after telling us not to makes clear, it’s an impossible directive.\u0026nbspBut the other “stop the spread” suggestion – regular hand washing – is incredibly achievable. And I wasn’t doing it. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve always washed my hands after using the bathroom or before I cook (I’m not an animal), but that was it. I didn’t wash my hands after handling money. I didn’t wash my hands after grocery shopping. I didn’t wash my hands after being on public transport. And then, because it’s impossible not to, I touched my face.\u0026nbspNow I wash my hands routinely and diligently, just like WHO tells us to. It costs nothing, takes little time, and I’ve come to find the ritual quite pleasant. I’m a relatively frequent cold-catcher, but even as the temperatures have dipped, I’ve not gotten sick.It shouldn’t have taken a pandemic to teach me to do this – primary school should have done the trick. I’ll never stop touching my face, but even when a vaccine is found, I’ll be poking at my cheeks using freshly washed hands.Have you developed any habits in lockdown you plan to stick with?

StepChange said 4.6m households had been affected so far.But despite the mounting risk of financial hardship, many people have saved money during the early stages of the pandemic, as lockdown has prevented them from eating and drinking out, visiting most shops and commuting to work.Amid the biggest-ever fall in consumer spending, UK households repaid a record £7.4bn of debt on credit cards and personal loans in April, according to Bank of England figures. Household bank deposits jumped by £16.2bn, more than triple the average monthly rise.The savings boom has, however, been uneven. According to the Resolution Foundation, as many as two in five high-income families have experienced budget gains in the crisis, comparedwith one in eight low-income households.StepChange\u0026nbspsaid that since the beginning of lockdown in late March, as many as\u0026nbsp1.2 million people had fallen behind on utility bill payments, 820,000 people on council tax, and 590,000 on rent.\u0026nbspAround 4.2 million people had borrowed to make ends meet,\u0026nbspmostly by using a credit card, overdraft or a high-cost product such as a payday loan.\u0026nbspAccording to the charity, as many as 2.7 million people have used payment holidays on mortgages and credit products that were brought in after talks between ministers and the banking industry.The government has extended payment holidays on mortgages by three months. The scheme was announced in March to help borrowers in financial difficulty because of the health crisis, and was due to expire at the end of June before it was extended by a further three months. The deadline for applying for an extension was also shifted to 31 October.The Financial Times reported on Monday that talks with banks were in progress about extending the break for those struggling to repay credit card debts. However, StepChange said more flexible terms would still be needed once the holidays ended to prevent a “cliff edge” for people who needed to start paying back their debts.Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange, said: “We were already dealing with a debt crisis, but Covid has so far added another four million people and counting to the number who are going to need help finding their way back to financial health.“This is a problem that isn’t going to solve itself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a8a93c1b1ffae89d8400ca5777bfc36cb6d1cc9/0_66_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8b1278815b9e72cad1c2c57ad6563f1","title":"bristol colston hall name change autumn 2020 bristol music trust","story":"Following the toppling of the Edward Colston statue, Bristol Music Trust to remove the building’s signage until a new name is decidedBristol Music Trust has committed to changing the name of Colston Hall, the city’s flagship concert venue, by the autumn following the removal of the Edward Colston statue in the city centre during last weekend’s Black Lives Matter protest.Until the new name is announced, the trust has said the external signage on the building is being removed “as a demonstration of our commitment”. The trust has clarified that the venue was built in 1867, 146 years after Colston died, and not founded using his money.In 2017, the trust announced plans to change the building’s name by spring 2020. Chief executive Louise Mitchell described the Colston name as “a toxic brand”. A consultation process involving 4,000 people from communities across the city was delayed owing to the coronavirus outbreak.The venue, which stands on Colston Street, is currently closed for a multimillion-pound redevelopment “The current name does not reflect our values as a progressive, forward-thinking and open arts organisation,” the trust said in a statement. “We want it to be representative of the city, a beacon of its values of hope, ersity and inclusion.”Bristol group Massive Attack have refused to perform at the concert hall while it bears the name of the slave trader, whose company transported more than 100,000 slaves from west Africa\u0026nbspto the Caribbean and the Americas between 1672 and 1689, cramming them into ships to maximise profit.The slaves, including women and children, were branded on the chest with the company’s initials, RAC. Unhygienic conditions, dehydration, dysentery and scurvy killed more than 20,000 during the crossings. Their bodies were thrown overboard.The bronze statue of Colston, erected in 1895, was toppled by participants during the city’s Black Lives Matter protest on 7 June and thrown into the harbour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0896836e751358a0ad66bf10af308ec503b1887/0_106_2796_1677/master/2796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ce66eb3493d14868c9cb9ca43871ee0","title":"is british theatre about to go out of business","story":"Every year, 34 million people go to the theatre, double the number that attend Premier League football.

Barely a gym lets a cross-training machine go unaccompanied by hi-NRG dance tunes. There’s a great choice of running playlists on Spotify, some with millions of likes from users who’ve found that the right music can push them farther and faster. Bruce Springsteen has even written a whole album about being born to run. But if you want to use music to help improve your running, it’s important to get to grips with the science, and how it applies to your running style.Given that most runners tend to follow a pace of 150 to 180 steps per minute, you need music that corresponds to that. One option is to pick music that has about 150-180bpm, so that you can match your steps to the beat. “Foo Fighters’ The Pretender, which has about 170bpm, is really, really popular with runners,” says Hallett.However, 150-180bpm is very fast in terms of tempo, so there’s relatively little recorded at those speeds – with the exception of more high-energy rock’n’roll, thrash metal or speed garage. So another option is to aim for music that matches your stride cycle – ie two steps rather than one. This lets you pick music that’s much slower. Something that’s particularly good? Hip-hop.One of the most pleasant ways to run is to do so in what’s known as a “flow state”. It’s a highly enjoyable feeling of being completely immersed in what you’re doing to the point where it’s as though you’re on autopilot, but which is in itself highly enjoyable. It’s also been shown to enhance running endurance.Karageorghis did a study where he ran people to exhaustion during a beep test and found that those who listened to music more easily entered flow state. But in order to enter flow state, it’s important to have the right listening experience. The more continuous the listening experience, the easier it is to enter flow state. So if you’re planning to go on a reasonably lengthy run, it’s best to avoid music with ads, and to ensure you’re not listening in a way that might be interrupted by poor signal. Using Spotify Premium, with ad-free music and offline listening, is one way to keep the flow state flowing, if you will. “Having interrupted music can be a little distracting and disconcerting – it’s not as beneficial as having continuous music,” says Karageorghis. “That’s why I often encourage people to create end-to-end playlists that contour their workout.”One of the most important ways that music can help take your running to the next level is by making you feel less tired when you exercise. When you’re listening to a soundtrack, you’re giving your brain something to process other than your physical activity. The music distracts it from focusing on the effect exercise is having on your body, so the parts of the brain that speak to each other to communicate fatigue are less able to do so – meaning you feel less exhausted than you otherwise would.“It’s as though the music takes up some of your brain’s bandwidth that would normally be used for communication with the working muscles and the organs,” says Karageorghis. “It limits the degree to which fatigue-related signals can enter conscious awareness.”One thing that is unaffected by how fast you’re running is music’s ability to make you feel like you’re enjoying yourself. Even at higher intensities, studies have found that music can make people enjoy exercise more than they otherwise would.Karageorghis has also found that not only does music enhance how pleasurable your run is, but it enhances your memory of your run. It makes you remember your runs more positively, associates them more with being positive experiences and increases your probability of running more frequently. As to the right type of music to ensure that your brain responds positively to running? That depends entirely on you.“It’s often to do with the personal associations that the music has for you,” says Hallett. “I had a participant who listened to music from their university days because it took them back to a time when they had less responsibility. Going on a run felt like a bit of escapism for them. Others were motivated by music that reminded them of people they knew. It depends what has meaning to you.”Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

You can dig a trench and get little insights, but it’s very difficult to see how they work as a whole. What remote sensing does is enable us to look at very large, complete sites, and to see in detail the structure of those cities without digging a hole.”A walled city that was first occupied in 241BC, Falerii Novi survived until around AD700, but very few ruins remain visible above ground today.\u0026nbspUnusually, the 30 hectare site – around half the size of Pompeii – has not been built over, allowing it to be scanned quickly by a series of antennae towed behind a quad bike. The architectural detail revealed by such a technique, such as at the city’s temple sites, is “amazing”, Millett said.\u0026nbspOne notable discovery, he said, was the location of the city’s water system. Rather than running along the network of streets, the GPR showed it was laid out underneath the buildings before they were built, suggesting the city was highly planned “in a way that’s familiar today, but not expected, I think, in the third century BC”.The team were also surprised to find a peripheral route circling the city lined with sacred buildings. One of these is a “big and spectacular” public monument, lined with colonnades and 60 metres in length, containing two smaller buildings with niches for statues or fountains – “and no one I’ve yet shown it to yet knows what it is”.While the meaning and function of the building remains a mystery for now, Millett said it may be derived from the religious and cultural practices of the Faliscan people, who occupied this part of Italy before it was conquered by Rome.\u0026nbsp“One of the big areas of discussion about the Roman empire is the way inidual local communities worked, and how that interacted with the overall structures of Roman imperial power. What you’re seeing at Falerii, with this religious element to the landscape around the edge of the city, is probably the product of the local Faliscan identity. We’re seeing elements of their religious practice, we imagine, recreated within the Roman sphere.”\u0026nbspMillett and his team have already used GPR scanning on a number of smaller ancient sites, including at Aldborough in North Yorkshire, but now hope to use it at the ruins of larger cities. “As I wander around the Roman empire, I look at all kinds of places and think, ‘Wow, what we could do there’,” he said.\u0026nbsp“It is exciting and now realistic to imagine GPR being used to survey a major city such as Miletus in Turkey, Nicopolis in Greece or Cyrene in Libya.\u0026nbsp“We still have so much to learn about Roman urban life and this technology should open up unprecedented opportunities for decades to come.”The team’s research is published in Antiquity.

As such, it has been nothing short of a tragedy that we haven’t been able to watch the show in the UK while under lockdown, since it fell off the streaming services some time after season two aired.However, miracle of miracles, this error has now been rectified. As of today, both seasons of Succession – our Fleabag and Chernobyl-beating best show of last year, remember – are available to view again. If you haven’t seen it, you should close this page now and steam through every episode as a matter of urgency as there are spoilers ahead. But if you have, let me whet your appetite for a rewatch with a list of Succession’s best moments.The first season of Succession had to accomplish a lot. Not only did it have to introduce you to some of the worst, least sympathetic characters ever seen on television, but it also had to make you care about them. When the season finale managed to do this, it was like watching a magic trick. Kendall Roy – the closest thing the series has to a lead – involves himself in a fatal Chappaquiddick-style car crash. In the immediate aftermath, he finds himself being sucked back into his father’s toxic orbit, and his total helplessness in the moment is enough to smash your heart into dust.How unlikable are the Roy family? Glad you asked. We get a good idea of their complete awfulness in the first episode, when the family take a spontaneous trip to play a game of softball an operation that involves fleets of helicopters and luxury cars. But when they find themselves a player short, Kieran Culkin’s smarmy Roman approaches the young son of some onlookers and promises him a million dollars if he hits a home run. The boy fails, Roman rips up the cheque in front of him and you have a brand new worst enemy.In season two, though, Succession hardened its gaze. It wasn’t just the Roy family in its sights any more it was the entire online-content industry. One subplot involved the acquisition of Vaulter, a vaguely ViceyBuzzfeedyGawkery website that was kept afloat on an empty wave of pure clickbait. The headlines that ran on vast screens in the background were perfectly judged – “Wait, Is Every Taylor Swift Lyric Secretly Marxist?”, “This Tinder for Pedophiles App Sounds Like a Really Bad Idea”, “5 Reasons Why Drinking Milk on the Toilet Is Kind of a Game-Changer” – even if they did hit a little close to home for a man currently employed to write a listicle of TV show moments for the internet.People often call Succession Shakespearian, and nowhere was this more evident than with Boar on the Floor, a game instigated by patriarch Logan Roy in season two. The rules of the game are simple: you pick your emotionally weakest dinner guests, and force them to them crawl around on the ground making pig noises while you throw sausages at them and chant: “Boar on the floor”. It’s both a power move and a Guantanamo-level act of total humiliation. When lockdown lifts, try it with your friends.A genius move on the part of Succession was to fold in elements of Brian Cox’s life into his character. For instance, in the second season it became apparent that Logan Roy, like Cox, was Scottish. An entire episode was set in his hometown of Dundee. In most shows, this might be an attempt to humanise a monster, but not here. In one scene, Roman reveals that he has bought the Scottish football club Hearts as an ostentateous show of love and loyalty Logan responds by telling him that he actually supported Hibs, and the wedge between generations becomes even bleaker.\u0026nbspThe characters on Succession are all so broken that even romance ends up rotten and curdled. In the episode Safe Room, Roman rings his father’s counsel, Gerri, to complain about nothing in particular, and they quickly fall into a bout of excruciating phone sex. “You disgusting little pig,” she tells him as he masturbates on his bed. “You are a revolting little worm.” Just to compound the awkwardness of the scene, Roman later proposes to Gerri.This is why you hire Brian Cox. At the end of the second season’s sixth episode, Logan learns that a skin-saving multi-billion-dollar deal he has long been angling for with his rival Nan Pierce has fallen through. For most of the series, Logan is the gruff puppet master. But as the rug is pulled from beneath him and he realises that he cannot talk his way out of it, he loses control and erupts in an orgy of genuinely frightening anger. “We haven’t finished! We haven’t fucking finished!” he screams at Nan’s car as it leaves, with such intensity you assume it will end in a heart attack. The man deserves all the awards going.“Bitches be catty But the king’s my daddy  Rock all the haters while we go roll a fatty  Squiggle on the decks  Kenny on the rhymes  And Logan big ballin’ on Hamptons time  L to the OG  Dude be the OG  A-N he playin’  Playin’ like a pro”. In years to come, this will be the moment that Succession is remembered for. In the meantime, it just appeared on Spotify.Tom might be the best character on Succession, an outsider who married into the family and simply cannot keep up with all their craven behaviour. In the season two finale, set aboard a comically extravagant yacht, he finally regains a scrap of control. Scared for his job and publicly humiliated, with his marriage in tatters, Tom (played by Matthew Macfadyen) sits down next to Logan and – without saying a word – grabs a handful of his food and rams it into his mouth. “It’s so batty and odd and so\u0026nbspSuccession, that moment,” Macfadyen said after the episode. “Tom’s really at a low ebb. He thinks,\u0026nbspFuck it, you know?”Finally, here’s the moment that will vault Succession into the future. The season two finale ended with Kendall decisively breaking away from the clutches of his father, by holding a press conference where he finally told the world the truth about all of Logan’s wrongdoings. On its own, the moment was utterly explosive. But then we cut back to Logan, watching the conference from the yacht. His unknowable smile – maybe pride, maybe contempt, maybe excitement at finally having a worthy foe – could send Succession in any direction whenever it returns.• Succession is available on Sky and the streaming service Now TV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8852caedc85628a2618cef4e99dc1ef19883da1a/0_166_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21293ab612ca6845e72834b2daa27b4e","title":"labour left uneasy with leaders view on tearing down colston statue","story":"Keir Starmer condemns ‘criminal damage’ but says we can’t have ‘a slaver on a statue’The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, sparked unease among some on the left of his party on Monday, as he condemned as “completely wrong” the tearing down of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol at the weekend.Starmer and the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said they shared the sense of injustice that had brought more than 100,000 people out on to the streets of the UK to join Black Lives Matter protests in recent days.He added: “Stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. We can’t, in 21st century Britain, have a slaver on a statue. A statue is there to honour people.“That statue should have been brought down properly, with consent, and put, I would say, in a museum.”Some leftwing Labour MPs privately expressed concern at what they felt was an unfortunate departure from Corbyn’s approach.Speaking in the House of Commons later in the day, Thomas-Symonds used a similar phrase to Starmer, saying, “I do not condone an act of criminal damage to remove it, but I will not miss a public statue of a slave trader.”Thomas-Symonds was responding to the home secretary, Priti Patel, who insisted: “Black Lives Matter, but police brutality in the US is no excuse for the violence against our brave police officers at home. So to the quiet, law-abiding majority, who are appalled by this violence, and have continued to act within the rules, I hear you.”The shadow home secretary made a series of demands of the government, including calling for Patel to act on the recommendations of the Wendy Williams review into the Windrush scandal, and the 2017 David Lammy review into the experience of BAME people in the justice system.But his measured tone contrasted with passionate interventions from prominent leftwing Labour MPs, including Lloyd Russell-Moyle, Nadia Whittome and Zarah Sultana.Whittome had earlier tweeted, “I celebrate these acts of resistance. We need a movement that will tear down systemic racism and the slave owner statues that symbolise it. And we need to win a government that will always be on the side of this movement.”Thomas-Symonds’ predecessor, Diane Abbott, also sounded a note of caution about Labour’s approach. “Nobody supports criminal damage. But we need to be careful not to sound as if we care more about the vandalism than the horrors of the Atlantic slave trade,” she said.“The truth is that the community in Bristol tried for years to even get a plaque on the statue that mentioned slavery. They were blocked. The statue should have been taken down years ago. There is an excellent museum of slavery in Liverpool. That would be the right place for this statue, if it is eventually fished out of the water.”One Tory, representing a former “red wall” Labour seat said Starmer had a significant amount of work to do to eradicate the perception that Labour was soft on law and order. They said: “If there’s one thing my voters can’t stand, it’s rioting. To them, it’s an anathema to the democratic process.” They said their inbox was full of messages, including from ex-Labour voters, on the protests over the weekend. “People don’t want soft-touch policing.”A group of seven “blue collar” Tory MPs also posed for pictures as they offered help to clean up the statue in Parliament Square of Winston Churchill, which had “is a racist” spray painted on it during the protest.One Labour MP in a red wall seat said: “These are the sorts of things that do test the fragility of the voter coalition that used to be very successful for us. Where we see isions on issues like Brexit, law and order, immigration and so on – these do become our test points. I thought Keir navigated that very well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d528d3ba499ce77d0c3af9e117c69325761ba243/0_43_2547_1528/master/2547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99b8736f3367251d711fd9f779cf78ff","title":"isolation and contemplation nadav kanders visual response to coronavirus","story":"In the first part of our series commissioned in conjunction with the Prix Pictet, a global award in photography and sustainability, photographers who have won or been shortlisted for the award over the last decade have been asked to make a personal response to the Covid-19 crisis. The ability to move us beyond cliche is a characteristic photographers shortlisted for the Prix Pictet share, and it is important as we grapple with the reality of the world as we emerge from the Covid-19 crisis.The global lockdown has birthed new cliches wildlife cautiously exploring the unpeopled streets, or iconic monuments devoid of tourists, ignored save the occasional solitary inidual escaping their confinement.This commission asked photographers to move beyond the obvious, and present a series of images that respond to the new issues confronting us, and begin to plot a route to a new future and new ways of thinking about the world.Some occasions or occurrences in my life present themselves in a way that, if not ignored, inform me as to how I tick, what is fundamental to me. What it is I constantly strive to grasp and express. It has the effect of bringing understanding to that that is intuitive.At the point this lockdown began, I was no stranger to solitude and the effect it has on me and my practice as an artist. When we separated ourselves, I was very aware of the feelings that arose in me from the forced distancing and shocked at how quickly my surroundings, which were until that moment a safe place, became quickly alienating and unsafe to me. Another human being becoming a threat, an enemy, a carrier of a deadly disease. I began thinking about the importance of touch to non-verbal communication and how the lack of it would produce a yearning for connection. My knee-jerk reaction was to go to my studio and riff off these feelings, which I tried but then resisted knowing the knee jerk in my case always results in work of little value.\u0026nbspWeeks later I began again.\u0026nbspThis is work with the guts of solitude, melancholy and longing which bring up feelings of both beauty and terror.I think of a quote by Rilke: “Love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you.”\u0026nbspSo many feelings are at play and I was aware that in this quiet time there was a much bigger picture playing out, and it will continue to play out in our future.As a child growing up in Johannesburg, South Africa, we had no TV. I had an electric train set that was made in Germany where my father was born. It was set out on a spare dining room table. No hills or tunnels, just a figure of eight with a station.\u0026nbspThere were small human figures dotted about, who with my imagination performed many duties depending on how I saw my mini world that day.In my studio I have many items on shelves that, out of context, are odd, causing to arise a mildly uncomfortable feeling in a viewer. Animal skulls, dolls, wigs, porcelain flowers, crucifixes and small humans, some from my train driving days.These folks performed once again for me and mirrored back at me the feelings of Solitude – Quietude – Contemplation that I felt most strongly in the first days of lockdown.\u0026nbspThe feeling of the unknown.\u0026nbspIt seemed not by chance that the Royal Academy show of Leon Spilliaert was opened just before the lockdown. The painter wandering alone at night near the water’s edge in Ostend and bringing his memory into the studio to paint the feeling as much as the scene he had just experienced.This series of work I hope brings up feelings of isolation, distance and contemplation in a viewer as well as a realisation that this time in history is bigger than just this virus. That it holds potential in its invitation to consider that this event is willing us human beings collectively to move towards balancing our indiscriminate use of nature’s resources.\u0026nbspThis is not a warped reality, it is just reality, and it comes out of man being out of balance with nature.\u0026nbsp• Prix Pictet was founded in 2008\u0026nbspby the Geneva-based Pictet Group, with the mandate to use photography to move beyond cliche and deliver powerful messages about sustainability to a global audience.

The piece was shared widely and viewed nearly 1m times. Readers got in touch to say they too were suffering from lingering and often strange Covid-19 symptoms.There is evidence that the official NHS description of the virus’s symptoms – cough, fever, loss of tastesmell – is too narrow. Those who do not need acute hospital treatment and who are isolating at home report a far broader range of problems. Often these go on for longer than 14 days. An online survey of 151 medical professionals who fell ill in March found 68 are still unable to work. A further 26 went back, only to stop again when symptoms returned.It appears coronavirus may be a chronic condition. How long it persists for is unknown. The symptoms can be serious and wide-ranging, affecting the lungs, heart, brain, kidneys, stomach and nervous system. Headaches, shortness of breath, sore throat and feeling exhausted are common. So is recovery followed by frequent relapses. Here are the stories of four women who are struggling to return to normal life.Iulia Hammond, 39, junior doctor in Manchester“I went down with Covid on 19 March. I had a fever, chills and a very mild dry cough. I took to bed, feeling like I couldn’t do much of anything. After three or four days I had really severe respiratory symptoms. It felt as if there were shards of glass in my lungs. It was the most horrendous thing I have ever experienced. I was absolutely terrified.“For the past 10 weeks I have been sleeping sitting upright in bed. It’s the only way I’m able to breathe. I developed pharyngitis and at one point I thought they were going to have to intubate me. I made two trips to A\u0026ampE and had tests. I chatted to my GP who says patients look OK and yet feel the worse they have ever felt. It’s such a horrible virus. It seems quite different in each person. There’s not a standard progression.“I’ve had a slew of symptoms. I got the worst headache I have ever had, like an electric cord over my temples and the back of my head. I get an odd crawling sensation on the left side of the face, including when I brush my hair. I’ve had abdominal issues and stomach pain and sensory things like pins and needles in my arms and legs. The illness comes around in two-week cycles. This has happened four times.“Every day I am still short of breath. In week six I got a left-sided stabbing chest pain. I now have an abnormal heart rate. This is something you can get with viruses and I’m hoping it will go. You wonder why is this happening? As a physician I have been reading articles. We are learning about coronavirus in real time. The virus is completely novel, akin to HIVAids in the 1980s.“I’m now on day 74 and not at work. Essentially I go bed, kitchen, sofa. There are weeks when I feel I have ridden the wave, and others where I’m back in the wave. I would like to get back to normal life sooner rather than later. It feels very endless.”Dr Tracy Briggs, 42, clinical academic and geneticist at the University of Manchester“I got symptoms on 13 March. We had been in London on holiday for half-term and rode the tube and went to museums. I felt short of breath. My chest was tight and my heart was racing. I have very mild asthma and I thought maybe it was an attack. It was strange. The inhaler didn’t work and after a few hours I went to A\u0026ampE. I was told to go home and isolate.“I wasn’t able to get out of bed or eat. I felt absolutely rough, sweaty, with a horrible sore throat and struggling to breathe. After 10 days I started to do a little bit more. I went for a walk with the family and pottered around the house. Then I seemed to step back and struggle again. Climbing one flight of stairs would send my heart racing. I would cough and be short of breath.“It has been such a rollercoaster. You start to question yourself and your own sanity. You wonder what tomorrow is going to be. It’s quite tough. My 12-year-old son had no appetite for three weeks, a sore throat and vomiting. My husband had a sore throat for a week and a mild chicken pox-like rash. My stepson had Covid symptoms and was coughing, but not as badly as me.”“My tongue and the back of the throat are red, white and inflamed. I’ve lost quite a lot of weight. I find myself choking on food and short of breath when I eat. I’ve been taking Gaviscon and today started on a course of proton pump inhibitors. I’ve had a feeling of burning in my sternum and my throat.“I felt hot and sweaty but didn’t have a documented high temperature. I think there is a need to recognise that the clinical symptoms are much wider than cough and fever. This isn’t necessarily something which lasts seven or 14 days. Absolutely acute patients are the priority. But we need to be aware that for a number of people, even those who don’t need to go to hospital, it’s going on for a long period. We need support.”Jo Platt, 46, former Labour MP for Leigh“I lost my seat in the December election. I wasn’t going to work or down to London. The only thing I can think of is I picked up the virus while shopping. The first symptoms began on 24 March. It was like flicking a light switch. I was at my computer and felt I was going to faint. I had nausea, dizziness and a burning temperature. Then the fatigue set in. I couldn’t move and went to bed for two days.“I recovered and thought I had something really mild. For two more days I was shaky. The next day I really went down with it. I had shortness of breath, an unproductive cough. It felt like something was in my chest. I had a horrific headache. I could not get out of bed for a full week. By the Easter weekend I thought I was out of it. But that Monday the symptoms returned. I called my GP. They were very nice, but said you haven’t got the usual symptoms and should rest.“The gastro thing is really worrying me. I lost a stone in weight and could not eat. My blood tests were normal apart from a vitamin D deficiency. I couldn’t get a test. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The government says if you haven’t got a cough or temperature or loss of taste it’s not Covid. That’s not true. My GP now says they’ve had numerous cases similar to mine.“This is week 10. I get back pain, like an inflammation. It’s not as severe as it’s been. I have a really strange sensation in my legs, as if I’ve been hill walking. I wake up with sore joints in my fingers. I’ve had gastrointestinal issues and acid reflux. Seeing food on TV makes me feel nauseous. This is manageable. For me the scary thing is the shortness of breath. We still don’t know how long this goes on for and that’s the frightening bit.“It started on 16 March. I had a slight cough and a terrible headache. The next morning my temperature was 38.3C. A week later, I was feeling worse and developed shortness of breath but it passed after a day or so. After another week I felt completely well. I went out for a short jog and felt fine. Normally I run 25km a week, swim and do yoga. But then later that week, after another short run, I was hit by extreme fatigue lasting four days. This happened another three to four times, after much less exertion.“Around week seven there was a big deterioration. It was my son’s birthday and I was busy, making him a cake, and we went on a short family bike ride too. A few days later, it all came back but much worse. I had lots of symptoms, including tingling on the right side of my body, and a sensation of heat on my left foot, as well as shortness of breath, chest pain and fevers. People talk about internal shaking. I had that and a feeling like my stomach was vibrating, deeply unpleasant and as if I was being poisoned.“It was very frightening to feel so unwell. Going into week nine I was exhausted. Staying in bed really helped with fatigue but in week 11, I still have low grade fevers, chills, malaise and odd neurological symptoms. I am resting a lot but my improvements have plateaued.“We don’t know what is causing prolonged Covid. Is it the ongoing initial illness, or is it an inflammatory reaction or is it a post-viral syndrome? We don’t know what the prognosis is or what the long-term consequences are. I wonder how many people are having prolonged illness and what the impact is on the workforce, for example. It’s scary to have an illness for which there isn’t any treatment and that doesn’t seem to be going away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30a4b1410dfe56d14e0f260cd6865f6a82e6c10/0_266_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03d3e6a186eddea6eb4305434f1f30cf","title":"what is coronavirus r number and is it rising in uk","story":"Research suggests the average number of people one person infects may be increasing – but opinions differ as to why With models suggesting that R could have risen above 1 in some parts of the UK, we look at what that means and how concerned we should be:R is a measure of the average number of people one infected person will go on to infect. If R is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but if it is below 1, the outbreak shrinks.The latest official estimates – produced by a group of researchers called Spi-M and based on multiple models – put R at between 0.7 and 0.9 for the whole of the UK, and between 0.7 and 1 for England alone.However, research by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge\u0026nbspUniversity suggests R is on the rise. R is now at around 1 for the south-west and just over 1 for north-west England.Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) also say the overall R may be creeping up, but put R in the south-west at 1and 0.8 in the north-west.There are a number of possibilities. One is that as lockdown measures have been eased, community transmission has risen. But speaking on BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Prof John Edmunds, an LSHTM epidemiologist, suggested another reason.“The large amount of community transmission that was occurring a couple of months ago has not come to a complete stop, but has reduced enormously,” he said. Instead, he argued, the epidemic has been concentrated in settings such as care homes and hospitals, where infections spread efficiently, meaning they are now influencing the average R to a greater degree, and hence R appears to have crept up. While spread of the virus in hospitals and care homes is of deep concern, and could seed infections in the community, Edmunds’ explanation suggests the relaxation of lockdown measures is not the main driver of the upward creep in R, and different measures may be required to tackle the trend. However, Edmunds said the key question that remains is whether transmission in the community is also rising – something he says is unclear, despite the PHECambridge team arguing that the rise in R “is probably due to increasing mobility and mixing between households and in public and workplace settings”.“They actually have that embedded in their model, that assumption,” said Edmunds, noting that the team drew on Google mobility data, which shows people moving around more. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that contact between iniduals has been going up by anywhere near the same amount.“We have been measuring people’s contact behaviour over the last two months or so and that has crept up a … very small amount, but hasn’t returned to anywhere near pre-lockdown levels.”When asked at a press briefing on Friday whether he believed R was above 1 in the community anywhere in the UK, Dr\u0026nbspPaul\u0026nbspBirrell, a co-author of the Cambridge study, said it was hard to say with certainty, “but my strong suspicion is that R is below 1 in the community, but is increasing”.The PHECambridge study reveals that while the median figure for R is 1.01 in the north-west, the full range of possible values is 0.83 to 1.18. Similar ranges are seen for the other regions.That means that it is not certain whether R is truly above or below 1 anywhere. Edmunds noted that other models give different figures: “I would stress that overall, the assessment is that it is still below 1 probably everywhere on average.” Recent lockdown relaxations are expected to be reflected in R figures over the course of the coming week.Also important to consider is the number of infections. When they are widespread across the community, an R above 1 is very concerning as it could mean a rise in cases that spreads to new areas – as happened at the start of the outbreak. Infection rates in the north-west remain high, so it is important to establish whether R in the community there is indeed above 1.However, as the overall number of infections in the community reaches low levels,\u0026nbspa large R may arise from a local outbreak or cluster of infections – a very different scenario. Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: “If R equals 1.1, and you have 10 infected, that is only 11 new cases, which means that ramping up efforts can easily contain it – if 1,000 are infected, that is 1,100 more, which is much harder.”If R is sustained above 1, however, the situation could rapidly deteriorate. Kao noted repeated outbreaks could also raise the risk of the infection spreading to new areas or triggering a new outbreak in a hospital or care home. In addition, experts warn, at low levels of infection, uncertainty in R increases.Dr Sebastian Funk of the LSHTM said the UK government appeared to be happy with R floating around 1, despite infections remaining relatively high. “That will come with the risk of higher number of deaths and morbidity compared to a scenario where you drive the disease to lower numbers before loosening the physical distancing measures,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0406f4b7a7218214f82b9902837e728e541e0d6/0_30_2361_1417/master/2361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17e844bc13d8e37558491d71eb7e8e04","title":"former spanish king juan carlos faces inquiry over 67bn saudi rail deal","story":"Reports suggested Juan Carlos received $100m from King Abdullah three years earlierSpain’s supreme court prosecutor has launched an investigation into the role the country’s former king, Juan Carlos, played in a deal in which a Spanish consortium landed a €6.7bn (£5.9bn) contract to build a high-speed rail line in Saudi Arabia.Reports emerged in March suggesting Juan Carlos received a $100m (€88m) payment from Saudi Arabia’s late King Abdullah in 2008, three years before the contract was awarded.Subsequent revelations about the former king’s financial dealings led his son, King Felipe VI, to strip his father of his annual stipend.On Monday, the supreme court prosecutor said an investigation had been opened to “define or discard the criminal relevance of events that occurred after June 2014”, when Juan Carlos abdicated and ceased to enjoy constitutional immunity from prosecution.According to a statement from the prosecutor, “the investigation pertains to the second phase of the construction of a high-speed rail line to join the cities of Medina and Mecca”.Given the investigation’s “institutional significance” and “undeniable technical complexity”, the statement added, the inquiry would be carried out by one of the supreme court’s chief prosecutors and three assistants.Felipe also renounced his personal inheritance from his father after it was alleged that he was set to receive millions of euros from a secret offshore fund linked to Saudi Arabia.According to the Daily , the alleged offshore account, named as the Lucum Foundation, was set up in July 2008 at an office in Panama City, and was tied to an account with Geneva’s Mirabaud private bank.The account apparently held about €65m in funds that were described as a “donation” from “the king of Saudi Arabia”.Prosecutors in Switzerland are also investigating another offshore fund allegedly linked to Juan Carlos, named the Fondation Zagatka.In a statement in March, King Felipe said he had become aware last year of claims that he was the beneficiary of the Lucum Foundation, and had decided to renounce any benefit from the fund. He also denied any knowledge of being a beneficiary of the Zagatka fund.The allegations have prompted calls for the Spanish parliament to investigate the former monarch’s business dealings.However, the Socialist party, which heads Spain’s minority coalition government, sided with rightwing parties to head off an inquiry, arguing it would be unconstitutional.Juan Carlos, once hailed as one of the world’s most popular royals and lauded for his role in Spain’s return to democracy, stepped down in 2014 after a string of scandals tarnished his reputation.Pictures of the king posing in front of a dead elephant while on safari to Botswana in 2012 did not go down well in a country still reeling from the 2008 economic crisis.Felipe was sworn in as king in June 2014, promising “a renewed monarchy for new times” and vowing to “listen, understand, warn and advise”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9389da9d4c95aefd3eb6b377d8360e26b10e7c7a/125_0_4375_2625/master/4375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e1a0c068d6ef55ce3e9f46be411a04","title":"has time in lockdown made you want to approach life differently","story":"If this experience has given you a chance to take stock and make some resolutions for the future, we want to hear from youLiving in lockdown has put everyone under strain, but it may also have given some of us time to take stock and work out what we really want from life.

The government has since refused to confirm whether the earlier date is under consideration.A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said only that officials were “working at pace to develop safe ways for pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes to reopen at the earliest opportunity it is safe to do so.”Ministers are expected to discuss proposals at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, potentially including a reduction in physical distancing requirements to 1 metre from 2 metres.Greg Mulholland, a former MP who chairs the British Pubs Confederation, said the government’s plans appeared “half-baked”, warning that the lack of clarity could make it impossible for pubs to be ready at short notice.He also voiced fears that pub companies might use the 22 June date as an excuse to charge struggling tenants rent, even if distancing rules made it impossible for them to open.JD Wetherspoon’s founder, Tim Martin, said opening some pubs would at least offer some confidence that the industry is returning to business as usual.“Few pubs will be able to make a profit using outdoor space only but partial reopening will provide a psychological boost to a beleaguered industry,” said Martin. “It will signal the intent of the government to make progress towards normality, which will be welcome.”Almost 700 of Wetherspoons’ 867 pubs have a beer garden, roof terrace or patio, and the company has previously set out plans for a pandemic-era pub involving bar staff wearing goggles and protective screens between tables.Mark Daniels, the landlord of the Brewers Arms in Worcester, said he would be keen to open his beer garden, but doing so inside a fortnight would be difficult.He said: “If things were right I’d jump at it. We’ve lost a lot of business already in what has been great weather with two bank holidays. But there are more issues to look at. If you can’t operate fully would there be rent supplements involved? Also, brewers will need to know as soon as possible to be able to supply the demand.”Some small craft brewers fear that a short-notice timetable would put them at a disadvantage to global brewing corporations.Sam McMeekin, a co-founder of the Gipsy Hill brewery in south-east London, said: “It is unbelievably complex to get fresh beer going again. It takes us about 25 days to get kegged beer ready and it takes a big brewer about four.“If they’ve got 15 days’ notice they can have fresh beer ready and available. They’ve also got the benefit of power over their suppliers, which helps them get the ingredients, even if it’s on credit. For us, people will be demanding payments for our next barley delivery.”McMeekin said small brewers would also be much harder hit if the pubs they sell to go out of business without paying their bills."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43b66515bbb72262c6848eadf629435bb9150cad/0_176_5004_3002/master/5004.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bca1aaf433dd7aac18f91de08b4182e5","title":"a beautiful day new zealand handshakes and hugs its way back to pre covid 19 life","story":"There may be tough economic times, and fresh cases, ahead but for now New Zealanders can enjoy a day free of coronavirus restrictions“I just had a meeting with someone and I thought, ‘Do I shake your hand?’” says Casey Allum, who was among those flocking to eat lunch at Wellington’s sunny, sparkling waterfront on Tuesday. Handshakes had been verboten until midnight on Monday, as people were required to stay a metre apart from colleagues, or two metres from strangers.“Then he came in with the handshake,” Allum says. “And I thought, ‘Oh sweet, that’s easy’.”New Zealanders woke on Tuesday to no restrictions on their daily lives for the first time since 21 March, with all remaining rules lifted after the country’s last known case of Covid-19 recovered from the virus. People in a nation that appears to have vanquished the coronavirus – for the time being – were permitted to hug and kiss strangers, to stand shoulder to shoulder at rock concerts, pray in large groups at mosques and churches, attend rugby games and throw large wedding parties or funerals.Strict border controls remain, with New Zealanders and their families the only people permitted to enter the country. They must remain in government-run quarantine for 14 days.The announcement by prime minister Jacinda Ardern that all other rules would be lifted at midnight – earlier than expected – sparked joy for many. Juliet Gerrad, the prime minister’s chief science advisor said she was enjoying “a cheeky midnight single malt” at the time the restrictions were officially removed. Others posted images of fireworks and wished each other a “happy new year.”\u0026nbspWhile no one was openly hugging in the streets on Tuesday, those walking outdoors were giddy with pleasure at the new status. The daring even pushed pedestrian crosswalk buttons with their hands, rather than the crouched elbow-jab New Zealanders have resorted to during the pandemic.\u0026nbsp“A little cheer” went up in Scott Harris’ office, where he and his central Wellington colleagues had held a “watching party” for Ardern’s news conference. He was most excited about returning to his favourite game.“Me and my mates run a lacrosse club,” he says, adding that it was “quite hard to run a contact sport with one-metre distancing.”Bars and nightclubs are also readying themselves for perhaps the most raucous Tuesday night they might ever have, as rules requiring patrons to remain seated and physically distanced, receiving only table service, were jettisoned.Kieran O’Malley’s staff at the Fork \u0026amp Brewer pub had spent the morning dragging furniture from storage ready to boost their capacity to its pre-pandemic 250 people, instead of the 100 the bar was permitted to accommodate during the later stages of Covid-19 restrictions.\u0026nbsp“It’s a godsend,” he says, adding that turnover had been “down by half” under the physical distancing rules. The government had made the right decision in shutting the country down, O’Malley says, but it had been tough and his business had needed more support.\u0026nbsp“Now we’re back to normal,” he said. “But it’s going to be a while before we build confidence back again.”In the window of one central Wellington gift shop on Tuesday, a quirky shrine to “Saint Ashley” has been erected Ashley Bloomfield, the even-mannered, often cautious health official has become a household name during the crisis, with his face printed on tea towels and turned into heroic memes online.Bloomfield, after reporting that 1,053 Covid-19 tests processed the day before had uncovered no new cases, says with a rare smile that it was “a beautiful day in Wellington”.But he warns that New Zealand has not seen the last of the pandemic.“We know this will happen,” he says, referring to the prospect of fresh diagnoses. “It may be that we detect a case at the border … we may even find cases still here on our community onshore.”Ardern has voiced her anger at learning The Warehouse, a locally owned big box retail chain, was considering more than 1,000 job cuts which the company said had been accelerated by the pandemic.\u0026nbsp“I do think they are a company that has promoted themselves as being in the community and for the community,” Ardern said, adding that many smaller businesses had resisted job losses.Knowing that victory might only be temporary did not take the gloss off for New Zealanders: both the capital’s and Christchurch’s daily newspapers feature a full-page cartoon on their covers, with a kiwi – the flightless bird – standing atop a number one, delineating New Zealand’s lowest alert level number, as spectators look on in awe.\u0026nbspThe weather report reads: “A fine, still day to welcome in level 1 and all the freedoms we used to take for granted.”Betrothed couples turned their attention again to their weddings, with restrictions limiting gatherings to 100 people lifted.“I’ve already had two of the brides who were thinking about it come to me and say, ‘We can set a date and get on with it,’” says Julie Lassen, a Christchurch-based celebrant, adding that even though couples could not invite overseas guests, some had decided to proceed anyway. “It’s made a huge difference because now everyone can relax and hug each other.”The lifting of rules was good news, too, for fans of New Zealand’s most beloved sport, rugby. The domestic competition will be the first professional rugby competition in the world to welcome fans en masse to sports grounds in the Covid-19 era when games kick off in Auckland and Dunedin this weekend. Stadiums are permitted to be filled to capacity.But public health experts still worry about the state of the country’s contact tracing.The country has seen fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases and 22 deaths after Ardern locked down New Zealand at the 200-case mark. Most say that despite the country’s seeming lucky escape from Covid-19, they would return to normal life with slightly cleaner hands than before.“We’re spraying and sanitising lots. It’s great to see every guy in the toilets washing their hands,” says bar manager O’Malley. “People sanitising their hands is great. Why not keep doing it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/badd30027c0e3b461e499e72fe0df00533d086b1/851_296_1320_792/master/1320.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e7263457698f4e0b8fe596a83527e9c3","title":"it is about our survival uaes mars mission prepares for launch","story":"Arab world’s first interplanetary mission will see probe orbit planet for a Martian year to study its climateThe Arab world’s first interplanetary mission, due to launch in 40 days’ time and reach\u0026nbspthe orbit of\u0026nbspMars\u0026nbspin February\u0026nbspnext year, is about the survival and future of the entire Middle East, the\u0026nbspleaders of the United Arab Emirates project\u0026nbsphave declared.\u0026nbspThe mission\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspalso\u0026nbspthe latest sign that the old cartel of space exploration, once confined to the superpowers, is being\u0026nbspbroken up by new\u0026nbspnational entrants\u0026nbspor private sector\u0026nbspfirms.The “Hope\u0026nbspMars\u0026nbspmission”,\u0026nbspdue to be launched on\u0026nbsp15 July, has been\u0026nbspin preparation by the United Arab Emirates\u0026nbspsince 2014,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspaccording to the project manager, Omran Sharaf, is seen as integral to the country’s long-term economic development. “It is about the future of the UAE and our survival,” Sharaf said.The mission’s\u0026nbspobjective is not to land on Mars, but\u0026nbspto\u0026nbsporbit\u0026nbspthe planet to\u0026nbspstudy the dynamics of its atmosphere over an entire\u0026nbspMartian\u0026nbspyear\u0026nbspand form a\u0026nbspmore\u0026nbspcomplete picture of its climate.\u0026nbspOne aim is\u0026nbspto find out\u0026nbspmore about\u0026nbspwhat\u0026nbspled to\u0026nbspthe planet’s atmospheric\u0026nbsploss, including the\u0026nbspdisappearance of hydrogen and oxygen\u0026nbspon the surface.\u0026nbsp“We are studying a planet that looks as if it was very similar to our own, but has undergone some form of change\u0026nbspto the point it can no longer have\u0026nbspwater, one of\u0026nbspthe major building blocks of life,” the deputy project manager and minister for\u0026nbspadvanced sciences, Sarah al-Amiri, said.\u0026nbsp“For instance, if there is a major dust storm on Mars does that increase the\u0026nbsprates of escape\u0026nbspof hydrogen and oxygen?”\u0026nbspData will be distributed to 200 research institutes and\u0026nbspbe complementary\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspthe work of\u0026nbspother missions, including Nasa’s, the UAE insists.All in all it will be a busy summer for Mars space missions.

Keeping it that way is the next big challenge Today, for the\u0026nbspfirst time since 28 February, New Zealand has\u0026nbspno active cases\u0026nbspof Covid-19.It is also the 17th day since the last new case was reported. New Zealand has a total of\u0026nbsp1,154 confirmed cases\u0026nbsp(combined total of confirmed and probable cases is 1,504) and 22 people have died.Today’s news is an important milestone and a time to celebrate. But as we continue to rebuild the economy, there are several challenges ahead if New Zealand wants to retain its Covid-19-free status while the pandemic continues elsewhere.It remains important that good science supports the government’s risk assessment and management. Below, we recommend several ways people can protect themselves. But we also argue New Zealand needs an urgent overhaul of the health system, including the establishment of a new national public health agency for disease prevention and control.Elimination is defined as the absence of a disease at a national or regional level. Eradication refers to its global extinction (as with smallpox).Elimination requires a high-performing surveillance system to provide assurance that, should border control fail, any new cases would be quickly found. Agreed\u0026nbspdefinitions are important\u0026nbspfor public reassurance and as a basis for expanding travel links with other countries that have also achieved elimination.It is important to remind ourselves that active cases are not the ones we need to worry about. By definition, they have all been identified and placed in isolation and are very unlikely to infect others. The real target of elimination is to stop the unseen cases silently spreading in the community. This is why we need mathematical modelling to tell us that elimination is likely.New Zealand’s\u0026nbspdecisive elimination strategy\u0026nbspappears to have succeeded, but it is easy to become complacent. Many other countries pursuing a containment approach have had new outbreaks, notably\u0026nbspSingapore,\u0026nbspSouth Korea\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspAustralia.New Zealand has spent months expanding its capacities to eliminate Covid-19. But maintaining elimination will be challenging. Airports, seaports and quarantine facilities remain potential sites of transmission from overseas, particularly given the\u0026nbsppressure to increase numbers of arrivals.Just as New Zealand prepared for the pandemic, the post-elimination period requires “maximum proactivity”. Here are five key risk management approaches to achieve lasting protection for New Zealand against Covid-19 and other serious public health threats.1. Establish public use of fabric face masks in specific settingsWith the end of physical distancing, we recommend the government seriously considers making mask wearing mandatory on public transport, on aircraft and at border control and quarantine facilities. Other personal hygiene measures (staying home if sick, washing hands, coughing into elbows) are insufficient when transmission is often from people who appear well and can\u0026nbspspread the virus simply by breathing and talking.The evidence base for the effectiveness of even simple fabric face masks is now strong, according to a\u0026nbsprecent systematic review published in the Lancet. The World Health Organization has also\u0026nbspupdated its guidelines\u0026nbspto recommend that everyone wear fabric face masks in public areas where there is a risk of transmission. Establishing a culture of using face masks in specific settings in New Zealand will make it easier to expand their use if required in future outbreaks.2. Improve contact-tracing effectiveness with suitable digital toolsNew Zealand’s\u0026nbspnational system for contact tracing\u0026nbspremains a critical back-stop measure to control outbreaks, should border controls fail. But there is significant potential for new digital tools to\u0026nbspenhance current processes, albeit with appropriate privacy safeguards built in. To be effective, such digital solutions must have\u0026nbsphigh uptake and support very rapid contact tracing. Downloadable apps appear insufficient and both\u0026nbspNew Zealand and\u0026nbspSingapore\u0026nbspare investigating bluetooth-enabled devices which appear to perform better and could be distributed to all residents.3. Apply a science-based approach to border managementA cautious return to higher levels of inbound and outbound travel is important for economic and humanitarian reasons, but we need to assess the risk carefully. This opening up includes two very different processes. One is a broadening of the current categories of people permitted to enter New Zealand beyond residents, their families and a small number of others. This will typically require the continuation of\u0026nbsproutine 14-day quarantine, until improved methods are developed.The other potential expansion is quarantine-free entry, which will be safest from countries that meet similar elimination targets. This process could begin with\u0026nbspPacific Island nations\u0026nbspfree of Covid-19, notably Samoa and Tonga. It should be possible to extend this arrangement to various Australian states and other jurisdictions such as Fiji and Taiwan when they confirm their elimination status.Even before Covid-19 hit New Zealand, it was clear our national public health infrastructure was failing after decades of neglect, fragmentation and erosion. Prominent examples of system failure include the\u0026nbspHavelock North campylobacter outbreak\u0026nbspin 2016 and the\u0026nbspprolonged measles epidemic\u0026nbspin 2019. The comprehensive\u0026nbsphealth and disability system review\u0026nbspreport was delivered to the Minister of Health in March and was widely expected to recommend significant upgrading of public health capacity. This report and its recommendations should now be released.We also recommend an interim evaluation of the public health response to Covid-19 now, rather than after the pandemic. These reviews would inform the needed upgrade of New Zealand’s public health capacity to manage the ongoing pandemic response and to prepare the country for other serious health threats.

But third level is about so much more than academia: it’s about getting involved, joining clubs and societies, having new experiences, making new friends and making mistakes. If the Covid-19 crisis continues well into the next academic year, will students - particularly incoming first years - miss out on that formative college experience?Across colleges and universities, student clubs and societies have been adjusting to an online life. Cian McGrath, deputy editor of UCC’s University Express, says that being involved in the college paper and societies such as NetSoc were the best part of his college experience. “NetSoc has moved a lot of our meetups online, and a lot of societies and clubs have done the same. Hopefully all colleges will have consideration for how important it is for students to meet up and make friends.”Peter Davis of Maynooth University’s sports services, says that student sports clubs and the associated professional bodies are working on ways in which sports or training can go ahead with social distancing. “We’ve been doing Zooms calls where students do speed and agility training together. Everyone needs to get out, get some air, exercise and social contact. We will have to do things differently: it will be a challenge and will have to be thought our carefully, but there will be some sort of offering.”At DCU, Dr Claire Bohan is director of student support and development. “How do we replicate the sense of being a student and the clear ide between school days and college?” she says. “Incoming first years will already have been through a tough few months. We are workshopping scenarios whereby we will be primarily online but with some on-campus learning. The campus will be open. We will do what we can within social distancing guidelines. Clubs and societies are student-led and they have been adapting fast. The big challenge isn’t continuing a social life for returning students it’s for creating a college experience for the first years who don’t know what they don’t know, and we will support them.”How might this lost opportunity impact on student mental health? “We’ve seen students who are struggling with additional stress in both their personal and family lives, while others are reporting significant improvements in their mental health,” says Marianne Dunne, director of students services and mental health at Maynooth University. “We have been able to adapt our supports such as counselling, health, budgeting and chaplaincy, using phone and video consultations, while also introducing new initiatives such as a virtual cafe, online yoga and meditation and an online book club. Overall, the level of student engagement and participation with our services since March 13th has been really positive.”Many students will be disappointed that they’re missing out on the full first year experience, but there are ways to engage now. Getting involved in a new club or society can seem daunting but most are very welcoming. All of those committee members or writers for the student paper were first years once, and because most college courses only last four years, clubs and societies are absolutely dependent on new members to keep going and to bring new ideas to life. It’s also no harm, once students know where they’re going, to look at the clubs and societies that interest them and maybe even to contact them and let them know that, despite whatever social distancing restrictions are in place, they’re keen to get involved.“We’ll be encouraging online meetups, table quizzes - anything that can get people talking and communicating,” says McGrath. “We know how important it is to welcome new students to college.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4268536.1591282842!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus and the new norm at third level","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhen done well, online teaching involves far more than putting your lecture slides on the internet and  substituting your scheduled face-to-face classes with live online ones. Photograph: iStockThe threat posed to public health by the coronavirus pandemic has led to universities across the globe having to address how they can continue teaching while keeping their staff and students safe.While non-essential businesses had to close their doors to the public in the space of just a few weeks in March, almost all teaching activity at Ireland’s universities and colleges had to rapidly migrate online.Course instructors had to adopt technologies that had never before been used on this scale in the experience of Irish education. All of a sudden, the virtual classroom took centre stage. Students would complete their studies online without having to attend classes in-person, while assessments and examinations were quickly reappraised and reconstituted.This migration represented the single biggest structural change in the third-level sector in Ireland in recent years. One academic referred to it as “the great onlining of Irish higher education”.While the rapid response of the sector to the pandemic was a testament to the universities and dedication of the staff involved, it quickly became apparent that this new approach, or at least a more sophisticated variant of it, would become the “new norm” for Irish education in the short to medium term.This, ideally, should mean revisiting the design of course programmes. Hastily shoe-horning course content online in response to a crisis might work as a stop-gap but it is not considered to be best practice when it comes to online education.“When done well, online teaching involves far more than putting your lecture slides on the internet and merely substituting your scheduled face-to-face classes with live online ones using Zoom or MS Teams,” says Prof Mark Brown of the National Institute for Digital Learning at DCU.“Indeed, this type of remote teaching and digital delivery of course content in a crisis is almost the antithesis of good online education,” he adds.“The challenge is to help educators understand that online education requires different learning designs and teaching approaches.”PlanningIn Ireland, colleges are already planning their own blended or hybrid approach to the delivery of education for the next academic year. In many cases, lectures will be delivered remotely while students will attend campus in smaller groups for face-to-face sessions, tutorials and lab work.While the new student experience is likely to be substantially different this year, students and their parents will expect that the integrity of academic programmes will not be compromised by the transition to online.The degree to which academic programmes will be redesigned to place online at the core of curriculum delivery still remains to be seen.Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the State’s watchdog for education standards, has already stated that it is working with partners across the education and training sector “to support and provide leadership for FET and HE providers in their efforts to maintain the integrity, quality and standards of the Irish education and training system, at this time of unprecedented challenge”.Fully transitioning courses online requires fundamental course redesign, a process that is costly and resource-heavy.Instead, most colleges in Ireland are likely to offer a blended approach where some elements will be delivered online and some delivered on-campus.They will spend the remainder of the summer months fine-tuning and re-evaluating their course offerings to make sure they fulfil the needs and expectations of their students, and it will probably be August before it becomes clear what students can expect in the autumn.Of course, any lengthy continuation of campus closures is likely to have significant and unforeseen implications for students and colleges alike. Universities have lost considerable revenues over the summer months from the loss of tourism and conferences, not to mention the losses likely to be incurred by the absence of foreign student revenues.Students are also likely to feel somewhat uncertain of what lies ahead with many questioning whether the costs normally associated with full-time college are justifiable when courses will be delivered online.Campus lifeMany academic, learning and social support services designed with on-campus students in mind will have to be adapted and innovative opportunities will have to be developed to assist students who wish to engage in the wider life of the university, including sports clubs and societies.Of course, huge uncertainties lie ahead and many students will ask whether they should plan for a return to campus this year or should they delay going to college by a year in the hope of a return to some degree of normality by then.In this supplement we look at some of the issues that are likely to arise in the upcoming academic year. We ask if it is possible to improve learning outcomes through online learning and examine what options are available to school-leavers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4270663.1591353131!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"where to begin when it comes to teaching a course online","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“The use of smaller, bite-sized chunks of information for all alternative formats used makes it easier for learners to engage with the content.”The starting point for instructors looking to move their programmes online should be to seek professional help. Most universities will have a Department for Online and Distance Learning and they will have the expertise required to help instructors understand what exactly online delivery will entail. Not every course will lend itself well solely to online delivery while others may enjoy improved outcomes when delivered through a well-designed bespoke online framework.Training is key. Delivering a course originally designed for in-class delivery to an online setting will require an understanding of the new format, the tools available as well as an insight into student expectations and planned course outcomes. The more prepared the teacher or instructor is, the better.Expectations are important too. Be aware of what students expect to get from the course and clearly set out how the course will function throughout the year and how students will be assessed. Prepare a course handbook and make that permanently available to students through the learning platform. “Set expectations as to the level of engagement required and have a clear statement of how the course will be assessed along with an assessment of engagement required,” she adds.Technology should be a concern! There should be an awareness that internet access and availability of digital resources will be an issue for some students. Therefore, certain flexibilities will have to be accounted for in the design of the course to accommodate them and their needs.The nature of the subject area is also important. Think creatively about how you will teach the course. Consider the tools available to you through the virtual learning environment. There are ways you could increase engagement through the use of online quizzes and other dedicated tools.One of the key strengths of online or distance learning is that students can prepare material in advance of a classroom session. Make that material available to them. It can be packaged into course reading packs or short recorded lectures, podcasts or video recordings for them to view in their own time.“The use of smaller, bite-sized chunks of information for all alternative formats used makes it easier for learners to engage with the content in a flexible format and increases the assimilation of information,” says McGuinn.Building prompts or check-ins for students asking them to carry out an exercise or directing them to research the concept further is a way to keep them interested and engaged in the course.Decide how you wish to use your live sessions with students - it is not advised to simply regurgitate the course notes. Instead, consider live settings as a dedicated learning opportunity where you can also encourage student discussion.Make sure to build in opportunities for pastoral support for students and check in to see how they are coping with online learning."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Such plants are 35 times more efficient at capturing and storing carbon than tropical forestsFaster cuts in methane and nitrous oxide from farming needed \u0026ndash Stop Climate ChaosOn-farm measures are key to reducing emissions - environmental watchdog"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteria"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Eliminating Covid-19 through tougher short-term measures represents the “most scientifically sound” strategy for Ireland, according to more than 1,000 leading Irish researchers.In an open letter published on Monday, the scientists say Ireland has “come to a watershed moment . . . the path we choose will determine our future for years to come”.They acknowledge the huge impact already on the economy but suggest measures now be deployed to “crush” the virus on an all-island basis, as many other countries have done. This, they add, is possible over a number of weeks not months.Signatories include public health specialists infectious disease experts, virologists, immunologists, and doctors including respiratory and intensive care consultants working in acute hospitals – many of whom worked on the frontline during the height of the pandemic.“Our current policy is to live with the virus under a long-term mitigation strategy, with the risk of future surges and lockdowns until when, or if, a vaccine becomes available. We have another option: we can do as many other countries have done, choose to suppress and eliminate this virus – ‘crushing the curve’,” they suggest.‘Normal’Because of a timely response the island of Ireland managed to bring the epidemic under control, they point out.“A range of emergency restrictions imposed by the two Governments, following scientific advice, stopped our healthcare systems being overwhelmed and saved many lives. The public support these restrictions, and report that they clearly understood the need for them.”All this had come at a huge cost, they note, with enormous sums of money spent many losing jobs and businesses wondering if they will be able to open again.People will once again feel confident in using public transport, returning to school, going out to eat and to shop, pressure on the healthcare system will be relieved, and trust in our economy will be restored, they accept.“For the economies on our island, this would be enormously valuable. Vulnerable people will be effectively protected.”There was, however, a push to get back to “normal” as fast as possible. “What does ‘normal’ look like if the virus continues to circulate? Right now, public transport is planning for 20 per cent of ‘normal’ capacity, pubs and restaurants 30 per cent, schools, at best only 50 per cent.“The costs of childcare, already high, will be impossible for many. Many workplaces will need expensive re-design. Many people will drop out, or be pushed out of the labour force. All of these are real costs, and will, we believe, far exceed the short-term costs of lockdown.”“For these reasons we strongly encourage the Governments to take resolute actions to suppress this pandemic at once. Eliminating the virus represents the most scientifically sound strategy in terms of public health and economics alike.”“Several countries have already largely halted the virus, including South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Austria, Greece, China and Iceland, by continuing public health measures, including the use of masks, active fast contact tracing and testing, and sensible restrictions on travel.”Such measures were planned for both parts of this island, “but they must be enhanced and coordinated – with the aim of achieving ambitious suppression targets”.This should be on the basis of first achieving suppression and elimination of Covid-19, “and then we must maintain it”.Realistic exit strategyThese countries achieved suppression, and some have demonstrated they can also maintain it in the face of new cases, as seen in South Korea. “Each country has developed its own solutions, to fit its own needs, and we can do the same on our joint island,” the scientists underline.“All our sacrifices over the last two months have driven down the number of cases, and given us a precious window of opportunity that we must not squander. This is a decisive moment in the history of our island.”The goal should be to suppress the number of new cases to zero as soon as possible, and to keep them there. Given political leadership, an agreed and scientifically sound strategy, and cooperation from citizens, “this can be done, and done in weeks, not in months”.“When we reach this goal, new infections have to be closely monitored for the foreseeable future under a robust, rapid, and vigilant testtraceisolate infrastructure.”Alternatively, if the country decides to live with the virus, they believe, “extensive, and expensive, restrictions will continue for the foreseeable future. A vaccine will take at least two years, and there is no established treatment”.Societies that have suppressed and eliminated this pandemic will enjoy considerably greater freedoms and prosperity than those where the virus persists, the signatories predict. Travel, tourism, and trade with other successful countries would be straightforward and beneficial.Given Ireland’s geography, population size and social cohesion, suppression was a realistic exit strategy “a genuine way out of our current economic and social standstill”.Lead signatories are epidemiologist Prof Anthony Staines of DCU infectious diseases ecologist Prof Gerard Killeen of UCC and immunologist Dr Tomás Ryan of TCD.The letter and signatories are available at http:crushthecurve.ieEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Staffing levels and nursing skills \u0026lsquonot commensurate\u0026rsquo with Covid-19 care needsHealth experts warn of increase in suicide and self-harm due to coronavirusBusiness at CAB Motor Company in Cork has been brisk, but work practices have changedFormer taoiseach breaks political silence to help bereavement counselling helplineOireachtas committee told current system needs overhaul to be fit for purposeProspective students have a lot to consider before deciding on third-level choiceCan digital courses match the traditional face-to-face classroom model?Do you know what terms such as \u0027asynchronous learning\u0027 or \u0027blended learning\u0027 mean?Consider live settings as a learning opportunity where you can also encourage discussionA Cork-based programme shows how art can be taught at a time of social distancingSome of the key areas students should be mindful of when learning onlineThe new student experience is likely to be substantially different from previous yearsHow will third level students adjust to the new realities of an online life?The third-level sector is expected to operate within budget and make cuts where necessaryWhat tools do Ireland\u0026rsquos third-level institutions use for online and blended teaching?Such plants are 35 times more efficient at capturing and storing carbon than tropical forestsFurther advice to be sought on singing while collections should be contactlessNo council supervision or cleansing regime planned, says Dublin City Council chiefMeasures now be deployed to \u0026lsquocrush\u0026rsquo the virus on an all-island basis, letter saysStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4273963.1591648977!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 testing could cost state 450m by year end says hse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople walk past reopened shops and businesses on O’Connell Street, Dublin, on Monday as  lockdown measures are eased. Photograph: Paul FaithAFP via Getty ImagesA Covid-19 testing system producing 15,000 results every day could cost the State €450 million by the end of the year, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has said.In correspondence sent to the special Oireachtas committee on the Covid-19 response, which sits again on Tuesday, the HSE said that running 15,000 tests “per day every day” would entail projected costs “in the region of €450 million”.Currently, the HSE has capacity to test about that number on a given day, but demand for testing is significantly lower, with recent data showing fewer than 5,000 community and hospital lab tests being carried out per day.A HSE spokeswoman confirmed the sum would be for producing 15,000 tests a day every day until the end of 2020.According to the document, the HSE believes that level of testing will “clearly will not be a requirement”, but warns that the current testing system needs a significant overhaul to be fit for purpose in the medium term.A spokeswoman said that current “temporary solutions are not sustainable for the longer term”.The HSE has previously announced that it will complete a strategic plan for testing and tracing by the autumn. The briefing document emphasises that the current testing and tracing model “is not sustainable in the long term”, due to its reliance on staff and equipment which have been temporarily reassigned from elsewhere, as well as the use of community centres and sports grounds such as Croke Park as sampling centres, and reliance on short-term laboratory provider contracts. It says a longer-term testing and tracing strategy will include its own financial plan.Testing equipmentSo far, the HSE has spent almost €80 million on testing and tracing, the document shows, including €33 million procuring testing equipment. Some €23 million has been spent on laboratory testing, and €14.5 million has been paid to general practitioners. The document shows that €371,000 has so far been spent on the HSE’s delayed Covid-19 tracing app. The costs of private labs are not yet included as contracts and payments schedules are being finalised.It also emerged that the State’s health watchdog warned the Department of Health in early April that 124 public and private nursing homes – a fifth of the country’s care homes - were “at risk” and could need additional support from the HSE to address outbreaks of Covid-19.Documents released to the Oireachtas committee show the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) told the department on April 9th “the lack of a direct relationship” between the HSE and private nursing homes would make it difficult to project the homes’ specific needs.Risk assessmentHiqa’s chief inspector Mary Dunnion told the department in a risk assessment that in a large number of private homes the “skills mix and competencies” of staff fell short of what was required to deal with the “escalating care needs of residents during a Covid-19 outbreak”.Meanwhile, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) confirmed another four deaths of people with Covid-19 in the State, the lowest daily number to be confirmed since March 11th. This brought the total number of deaths associated with the disease to 1,683. Another nine cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed, bringing the total to 25,207.While the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations has fallen, the average number of close contacts reported by those infected with the disease jumped to more than five.Speaking at the NPHET briefing, the State’s chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, has said Irish people “can do better” when it comes to the wearing of face masks in public as part of an effort to suppress the spread of coronavirus.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4273818.1591635187!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"enda kenny on grief in the age of coronavirus pandemic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer taoiseach Enda Kenny will be unveiled as ‘the voice’ of the Irish Hospice Foundation’s new national bereavement counselling service for those suffering loss. File photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Like most people who have spent a lifetime in politics, former taoiseach and Mayo TD Enda Kenny was no stranger to funerals and graveyards during a 45-year career.Reflecting yesterday, Mr Kenny said there were “literally thousands of occasions over the last 45 years” where he and others in politics had “seen tragedy and grief in all its forms”.Today, Mr Kenny will be unveiled as “the voice” of the Irish Hospice Foundation’s new national bereavement counselling service for those suffering loss.The support line – the first of its kind in the country – was set up by the foundation to provide comfort to those who were bereaved during the coronavirus pandemic, but forced to grieve alone.Irish funerals are public events, with time-honoured traditions and rituals that bring comfort, where friendships are strengthened, acquaintances renewed and communities are unstinting in their support.From Monday, some of the curbs on funerals have been relaxed. The number of mourners has risen from 10 to 25, but there are still no wakes, no house visit, no shaking hands or embraces.Having agreed to voice radio advertisements for the service, Mr Kenny said grief, if not properly dealt with, can prolong agonies and dominate people’s lives.Human tear“Sometimes it is so deep that it takes a long time for people to kind of look at the rest of their lives,” he said, “to get that out of them is what the hospice is doing here”.The foundation “bring out that grief” and that is really important for their mental health and their wellbeing, he told The , ahead of the launch of the campaign.“Ireland does death, bereavement and grief very well,” he explains. “We understand what the lump in the throat is, what the human tear is and what it is to talk and talk it out.”Mr Kenny’s own political life was shaped by grief. His father Harry Kenny died aged 62 in September 1975 and the young Enda Kenny, then just 24, won the seat in a byelection.Henry Kenny had cancer for a short time. “You never think that people will die, but when it came, it came as a shock,” he said. The six weeks between his father’s death and his own byelection win are still a “blur” in his mind.During the years afterwards, he attended countless funerals – part of the duty of respect required and expected of rural deputies, if derided by others remote from such surroundings.Greatest respectSometimes, the greatest respect that could be shown for the departed, and those left behind were on those “hundreds of occasions” where he sat in kitchens learning when to speak, or, as importantly, when not to say nothing at all.In 2011, the year he became taoiseach, he learned of the passing of his mother Eithne, who was 93, as he was onboard the LE Róisín as it rounded Tuskar Rock in a gale.They had just passed the lighthouse when the call came through. Her own father had been a lighthouse keeper. Nearly a decade on, Mr Kenny remembers the moment.It is something to be able to see funeral remotely on the web, he said, but no substitute for the real thing. “You have to go into kitchens, you’ve got to hug them and shake hands with them.“We are all on the same conveyor belt and it can be so difficult for families. Some people are grieving on their own and are absolutely lonely. They need that human contact,” he said.The national freephone service (1800 80 70 77) will be available Monday to Friday from 10am to 1pm.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4273662.1591627307!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"face coverings should be compulsory on public transport says union","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDermot O’Leary, NBRU: ‘Unless the Government comes out with a clear policy underlined by legislation, you are not going to get people wearing those masks.’ Photograph: Nick Bradshaw There is little evidence that commuters are wearing masks on public transport despite Government advice, the leader of the largest transport union has said.National Bus and Rail Union (NBRU) general secretary Dermot O’Leary said the feedback from its members is that few people are heeding the advice and that there will inevitably be conflict on public transport.He suggested that this vindicates his union’s stand that wearing face coverings such as a mask or a scarf on public transport should be mandatory not optional.Under the current phase 2 of the lifting of restrictions, the public are advised to wear face coverings on public transport, but, unlike in Britain and other countries, they are not mandatory.From June 15th it will be illegal in England not to wear face masks on public transport and in Belgium and France fines are already being issued to those who do not wear them.“Unless the Government comes out with a clear policy underlined by legislation, you are not going to get people wearing those masks,” Mr O’Leary said.“I would have thought that the scientific evidence is stacking up on a daily basis that wearing face coverings are a beneficial thing,” he added citing the evidence of some such as Prof Luke O’Neill of Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) special envoy Dr David Nabarro who have come out in favour of wearing them.“We would appeal to the Government to put forward the legislation and make it mandatory like it is in many countries throughout Europe, ” Mr O’Leary stated.Dáil committee submissionThe NBRU has made a submission to the Dáil committee on Covid-19 asking for legislation to be brought forward in relation to the issue.Mr O’Leary said the numbers using public transport had not “spiked significantly” on Monday.His observations were corroborated by the National Transport Authority (NTA) which stated there had been “no significant increase in demand on public transport services so far today with services running smoothly.”The NTA added: “We continue to urge customers to wear face coverings while on public transport. Doing so will increase protection for other customers and for public transport workers.“This is an important part of the effort to rebuild confidence in public transport as we move through the phases of the roadmap, and as restrictions are eased across the country.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4273544.1591620338!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unregistered butcher selling meat not fit for human consumption closed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConsumers are advised not to eat the implicated products.

watchdog.JLM Foods and JLM Family Butchers, located on Main Street, Tyrrellspass, was served a closure and prohibition order by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).Inspectors found the premises had “not been registered or approved by a competent authority” for the purposes of storing and processing meat products.“In the absence of official controls, it is not possible to verify compliance with food law and there is an increased risk that unsafe food may be placed on the market,” the FSAI closure order stated.The inspection found there were no food safety procedure records available on site, and “allergenic ingredients”, such as wheat and celery, were not declared in some products.“The risk of undeclared allergens in food presents a serious risk to the health of consumers with allergies or intolerances to those ingredients,” the closure order stated.The watchdog found microbiological hazards had not been identified as risks in vacuum packed meats, and there was no evidence to confirm use-by dates on meat products were correct.Some raw meat products were not clearly labelled by the business to inform customers of the requirement to thoroughly cook the product prior to consumption.Inspectors found “unlabelled meat in a delivery vehicle which could not be reliably traced back to the establishment of origin.”The premises was the only business shut down by the food safety authority last month, who issued a recall notice for meats sold and distributed by the business.The watchdog also issued a prohibition order to Bruno Cesar Silva Gomes, a retailer in Bailis Manor, Navan, Co Meath, over meat produced at the premises.Inspectors found meat products were not labelled with use-by dates and “therefore it could not be established if these products had exceeded their intended shelf-life.”There was also meat which “had been transported and stored by an unregistered food business operator without refrigeratedtemperature controlled transport facilities.”The prohibition order directed the business to ensure that several items of food deemed not fit for human consumption by inspectors were destroyed.Commenting on the orders, Dr Pamela Byrne, FSAI chief executive, said she was concerned some illegal food business operators could be using the coronavirus pandemic to take advantage of people shopping locally.“The prohibition orders resulted in over 1,500kg of meat and meat products being seized and destroyed,” she said.The enforcement actions taken by the watchdog last month were on foot of “blatant disregard for compliance with food legislation,” she said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Hospitals feel the

regarding the fourth round of Brexit negotiations. Photograph:  Daina Le Lardic PoolGetty ImagesBusinesses in Northern Ireland should be able to use workarounds and exemptions to make checks on goods on the Irish Sea border less onerous, chief European Union negotiator Michel Barnier has said.He was responding to an opinion column in The  in which contributor Newton Emerson expressed concerns that the EU was cynically taking a “maximalist” position on checks in order to use the North as a “bargaining chip”.Mr Barnier emphasised that the special arrangements for the North – under which it will apply EU customs rules so that checks take place in ports and airports there rather than on the land border with the Republic – had been jointly drawn up and agreed with the British government, and that there was room for pragmatism within them.“Regarding Mr Emerson’s concerns ... I would say that we can take into account those concerns within the framework as it’s currently written, because it’s written in a very precise way,” Mr Barnier told reporters after the latest round of EU-UK talks concluded.Imported“Simplified declarations can be used for large economic operators, supermarkets being one of them,” he said.For goods that are imported into the North from Britain or elsewhere outside the EU, exemptions on tariffs are possible if it can be proved that the produce will not enter the single market.“This is something we are discussing with the United Kingdom as we speak,” Mr Barnier said. “We’re ready to work with the UK further on all aspects of what the EU customs code can offer in order to facilitate trade and do everything we can do that end. But for that we need genuine commitment also from the UK side also on a number of technical issues which I have to say isn’t always forthcoming.”Special arrangementsA joint EU-UK committee is currently overseeing the implementation of the special arrangements for the North agreed as part of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.\u0026nbspOfficials have said that plans for additional infrastructure to enforce checks need to be agreed swiftly in order to be ready for when the new arrangements come into force at the end of the year.Mr Barnier insisted he was keen to find a compromise. “I’m not dogmatic. Sometimes there is a bit of spin amongst UK politicians saying I’m some kind of dogmatic person and representing a technocratic commission, but I’m a pragmatic man,” he said.“I’m sure if we don’t get bogged down in ideological debate with pragmatism we can pull this off.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"British-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4271818.1591367972!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk says sides need face to face talks to make progress","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t British Brexit negotiator David Frost: “Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK’s well-established position on the so-called ‘level playing field’, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.” Photograph:  Kenzo TribouillardAFP via Getty ImagesBritain’s chief negotiator David Frost described progress in the Brexit talks as “limited”, adding that the two sides were close to the limits of what could be achieved without face-to-face talks.Speaking after the latest round of talks ended on Friday, he said the talks must intensify and accelerate but appeared to abandon Britain’s threat to leave the talks if the shape of a deal was not in sight by the end of June.“We need to conclude this negotiation in good time to enable people and businesses to have certainty about the trading terms that will follow the end of the transition period at the end of this year, and, if necessary, to allow ratification of any agreements reached,” he said.“For our part we are willing to work hard to see whether at least the outline of a balanced agreement, covering all issues, can be reached soon. Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK’s well-established position on the so-called ‘level playing field’, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.”In its negotiating mandate last February, the British government said that if not enough progress was made in the talks by June it would “need to decide whether the UK’s attention should move away from negotiations and focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion”.A senior British negotiating official said on Friday that coronavirus had delayed progress and it was time for talks to move to a different format with a smaller group of negotiators. The official rejected Michel Barnier’s accusation that Britain was disregarding the political declaration Boris Johnson agreed with the EU last October alongside the withdrawal agreement.“We are committed to the political declaration. We see it, as it describes itself, as a document that sets out the parameters. It isn’t in itself a treaty,” the official said.The source said that Britain’s offer to accept tariffs on some products rather than agree to level playing field commitments on fair competition fell on “stony ground” in Brussels.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

The country is still seeing fewer than 300 new cases on average each day.A similar scenario is playing out in Sweden, where citizens have been able to retain many of their freedoms during the pandemic.New cases and deaths are on the rise, by between nine and 12 per cent over the last week, but numbers remain relatively low, with fewer than 600 daily cases and 50 deaths.In the UK, newly reported cases and deaths continue to fall but at a much slower pace than countries which saw outbreaks at a similar scale. In Italy, new cases and deaths are falling at an average rate of between 23 and 28 per cent over the last week, and in Belgium, between 15 and 23 per cent.In the UK, deaths have begun to plateau, partly due to revisions in historic data over recent days.On June 1 445 deaths were added to the historic data after being identified through testing carried out by commercial partners.But the rate of infection is also falling at a much slower rate - an average of nine per cent over the past week.The implications of the slow recovery in the UK are most concerning as he country is still seeing higher numbers of infections and deaths than many of its European neighbours.More than 1,800 new cases are still being detected each day, eclipsing those in Italy (395), Belgium (156) and Germany (435).And with more than 300 new deaths reported each day on average, the death rate in the UK is four times higher than in Italy (75).On Friday, new analysis from Public Health England and Cambridge University revealed the R rate - the rate at which the virus multiplies within a population - had crept back up to 1 in the North West and South West of England.Dr Yvonne Doyle, PHE medical director, said: Our estimates show that the regional R numbers have increased although they remain below one for most of England - this is to be expected as we gradually move out of lockdown.It is vital that everyone continues with social distancing, practising good hand hygiene and must remain at home and order a test if they have symptoms.Due to changes in the way data has been reported in Spain and France over recent weeks, they have been omitted from this analysis as they are unreliable for comparisons.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus lockdown trusting dissenting frustrated tribe","story":"The country is iding into tribes of \u0027the trusting\u0027, \u0027the dissenting\u0027 and \u0027the frustrated\u0027 as lockdown eases, an analysis has revealed.Factions are forming in the population, each with a distinct level of fear of Covid-19 and degree of faith in the Government to handle the coronavirus pandemic, New King\u0027s College London researchers have concluded.While people are equally split between the \u0027trusting\u0027 and \u0027dissenting\u0027 groups (38 per cent each), 24 per cent are part of the \u0027frustrated\u0027 tribe, their analysis of an Ipsos MORI survey of more than 2,000 UK residents reveals.These emerging schools of thought are underpinned by whether people vote Labour or Conservative, and if they are Brexiteers or Remainers, say the researchers.The \u0027trusting\u0027 group are mainly Brexit-supporting Conservative voters who are concerned about the health impacts of the virus and are most likely to trust the Government\u0027s decisions on exiting lockdown..The majority support the relaxation measures announced so far and think the authorities are doing a good job of protecting the public from the virus, but they still worry about restrictions being lifted too quickly.In contrast, the \u0027dissenting\u0027 tribe are primarily Labour-voting Remainers who are the most worried about health risks. They are also the most critical of the Government\u0027s response to the virus and have the least faith in it handling it well.Just four per cent think the Government has done a good job of protecting people from Covid-19, and 90 per cent think the lockdown is being lifted too quickly.Meanwhile, the \u0027frustrated\u0027 tribe are similar to the \u0027trusting\u0027 in that they are mainly Conservatives who voted for Brexit, but when it comes to health risks they are far less concerned and are eager for restrictions to be lifted more quickly.They are the group most likely to be negatively impacted by the lockdown in terms of employment and finances, and think the dissenters are exaggerating the threat posed by the virus.Dr Daniel Allington, senior lecturer in Social and Cultural Artificial Intelligence at King’s College London, said: “The size of the trusting group shows that many people will follow the Government’s lead even if they are personally afraid.But as the social costs of lockdown continue to grow and a vaccine remains a distant hope, it will become more and more difficult to choose between the contradictory demands of the dissenting and the frustrated.”Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London, added: “We went into the lockdown incredibly unified, with nine in 10 of the public supporting the measures – but we’re becoming much more ided on the way out. In particular, our views are now aligning much more clearly with our underlying political identities.The trusting are putting their faith in the Government, the dissenting very clearly are not, with only 4 per cent thinking the Government has done a good job.“The frustrated are quite different, with a much clearer view that we’re relaxing the restrictions too slowly. This seems to be driven by a much greater focus on the economic impacts, and in turn, a high number of this group are already suffering from financial and other impacts from the lockdown.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"home secretary describes experiences racism vows bring violent","story":"Priti Patel has spoken movingly of her experiences at the hands of racists, as she vowed to bring those who had subverted the Black Lives Matter cause by attacking the police and damaging property, to justice.The Home Secretary, who is the daughter of Ugandan Indian immigrants, rejected suggestions from a Labour MP that the Government did not understand racism, describing how she had regularly been called a P*** in the playground, had frequently been racially abused in the street and had been told to drop her surname and take her husband\u0027s in order to advance her career.She also made reference to a cartoon in the  newspaper in which she said she had been depicted as a “fat cow with a ring through its nose, something that was not only racist but offensive, both culturally and religiously”.In an impassioned speech in the House of Commons, she said the Government was clear that discrimination had no place in British society.But she said those who used violence and vandalism during the weekend’s Black Lives Matter march were betraying the very cause that they purported to serve.She told MPs the attacks on police officers had been  “utterly indefensible hooliganism.Ms Patel went on: “There is no justification for it. There is no excuse for pelting flares at brave officers, throwing bikes at police horses, attempting to disrespect the cenotaph or vandalising the statue of Winston Churchill - one of the greatest protectors of our freedoms who has ever lived.   “It is not for mobs to tear down statues and cause criminal damage in our streets. And it is not acceptable for thugs to racially abuse black police officers for doing their jobs.”She went on: “To the quiet law-abiding majority who are appalled by this violence and have continued to live their lives within the rules – I hear you.   “To the police who have been subject to the most dreadful abuse – you have my full backing as you act proportionately, fairly and courageously to maintain law and order.   “And to the criminal minority who have subverted this cause with their thuggery, I simply say this, your behaviour is shameful, and you will face justice.”Her statement came after a weekend of racially fuelled violence in which 35 police officers were injured and statues and monuments were vandalised and destroyed.Rank and file officers said they had been ill equipped to deal with the violence and called for more protection for those on the frontline.A row also erupted over the failure of the police in Bristol to prevent criminal damage to a statue of the 17th Century slave trader, Edward Colston, which was torn down and thrown in the city’s dock.Andy Marsh, the Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police defended his officers’ “tactical decision” not to intervene, insisting any attempt to arrest those responsible could have had serious ramifications in Bristol and beyond.He explained: Can you imagine scenes of police in Bristol fighting with protesters who were damaging the image, the statue of a man who is reputed to have gathered much of his fortune through the slave trade?I think there would have been very serious implications and whilst I certainly do not condone crime or damage of any sort, I fully support the actions of my officers. They responded with common sense, sound judgment and in the best interests of public safety.”But John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation said such an approach sent out the wrong message.He said: I understand there has been a lot of controversy about this statue for many years - so the question is why didn\u0027t those in the local authority consider taking it down long before rather than waiting for these actions?He added: I am a police officer so I don\u0027t support this lawlessness we saw where this statue was ripped down and rolled down the street and pushed into the river because that is not how we do things.I understand the anger but not to have a police presence there was something - I have been a police officer for 27 years - that was a decision I have not seen taken before.”There was also anger at the way the protests in London had been policed with damage to nationally important statues allowed to take place and violence resulting in injuries to 35 officers.The memorial to Sir Winston Churchill was daubed with the word, ‘racist’, while one protester was seen clambering onto the Cenotaph in Whitehall and attempting to set fire to a Union Flag.Met Commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick said they would work to bring those responsible to justice.She said:  “The violent criminality we saw is disgraceful and will have been very frightening for others.“Unfortunately some statues and iconic sites have been damaged. We will investigate and seek to identify all those responsible for any criminality.”Ken Marsh, the chairman of the politan Police Federation, said his colleagues, had been ill equipped to deal with the violence and said it as time to take a much more robust approach.He said: “Let me be clear, we as a police service can deal with these outbreaks of disorder, no problems. But it seems we are more concerned about image and perception rather than protecting our brave police officers and maintaining order.  “Our colleagues have a role in democracy to facilitate peaceful protests. Police officers should not come under attack for fulfilling that role. Whilst we understand and appreciate the cause that is being highlighted, a violent minority have decided to attack our colleagues. We have sadly seen colleagues bloodied this weekend. It is never acceptable.“We should be dealing with this disorder far more robustly. We need to have the correct equipment on to deal with what is in front of us. Our leaders have to respond and kit us up correctly and make sure we are fully prepared for what is taking place.”Yesterday volunteers, including a number of Conservative MPs helped scrub the slogans from Churchill’s, while police hunted those responsible.Last night a masked protester claimed responsibility for the damage telling the BBC: “I tagged up the statue of Churchill because he\u0027s a confirmed racist. He fought the Nazis to protect the Commonwealth from invasion - he didn\u0027t do it for black people or for people of colour or for people of anything. “He did it sheerly for colonialism. People will be angry - but I\u0027m angry that for many years we have been oppressed.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrew has offered witness three times epstein investigation","story":"The Duke of York has been treated worse than an ordinary citizen, his lawyers claimed on Monday as they hit back at accusations he has offered “zero cooperation” to the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.In the latest twist in the saga concerning Prince Andrew’s links to the billionaire paedophile, the Duke’s legal team insisted he had offered to speak to the US authorities “on at least three occasions this year”.Revealing the Department of Justice (DoJ) had confirmed that the Duke “is not and never has been a target of their criminal investigations into Epstein”, the statement by Blackfords law firm accused US prosecutors of “seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proffered.”The salvo followed reports that the DoJ had invoked the terms of a legal treaty with Britain in an attempt to question the Queen’s son as a witness for their investigation into Epstein’s historic sex-trafficking network after he committed suicide in prison last August.In March, Geoffrey Berman, the US Attorney for the southern district of New York, claimed the Duke, 60, had “completely shut the door” on cooperating with the case, following briefings that there had been a “wall of silence”.Describing the statements as “misleading and inaccurate,” the Duke’s lawyers said: “It is a matter of regret that the DoJ has seen fit to breach its own rules of confidentiality, not least as they are designed to encourage witness cooperation.“Far from our client acting above the law, as has been implied by press briefings in the US, he is being treated by a lower standard than might reasonably be expected for any other citizen.“Further, those same breaches of confidentiality by the DoJ have given the global media – and, therefore, the worldwide audience –  an entirely misleading account of our discussions with them.”Mr Berman hit back on Monday night, claiming the Duke had “falsely portrayed” himself as wanting to help the investigation. In a scathing statement, issued by the US Department of Justice, Mr Berman said: “Today, Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate with an ongoing federal criminal investigation into sex-trafficking.He added: “The Prince has not given an interview to federal authorities, has repeatedly declined our request to schedule such an interview, and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally that he would not come in for such an interview.“If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open, and we await word of when we should expect him.”The Duke and Epstein met on at least 10 occasions after being introduced by socialite Ghislaine Maxwell in 1999. He admitted it was an “error of judgment” to stay with Epstein in 2010, after Epstein had served 18 months for procuring an under age girl for prostitution.One of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, claims to have had sex with the Duke three times, when she was 17. He denies any wrongdoing.The 600-word statement states that the Duke has offered to help the investigation as a witness three times since first being contacted on Jan 2 this year, after 16 years of the DoJ “actively investigating Mr Epstein and other targets”.The on-record statement was published yesterday after a report in The Sun claiming US investigators had “officially demanded Britain hand over Prince Andrew to be questioned” about Epstein under a “mutual legal assistance” request – usually used in criminal proceedings – to the Home Office.The Duke, who is eighth in line to the throne, “stepped back” from public duties in November after a disastrous interview about his friendship with the late Epstein. In a statement issued by Buckingham Palace then, he said: “Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.”Now represented by an external crisis management firm and advised by Clare Montgomery QC, the leading British expert on extradition law, he has been accused by lawyers for Epstein’s victims of failing to cooperate.The Duke has consistently said he has no recollection of meeting Ms Giuffre. He has previously said he had no contact with Epstein after a visit to New York in Dec 2010.A source said the Duke has “every incentive” to aid the inquiry as a witness, with the ongoing focus on him now a “distraction” from the failures of the Epstein investigation and the ability of the victims of the convicted paedophile receiving the “justice they deserve”.Outlining contact between the Duke’s lawyers and the investigation so far, the new statement said the DoJ had “advised us that the Duke is not and has never been a ‘target’ of their criminal investigations into Epstein and that they sought his confidential, voluntary cooperation”.“We were given an unequivocal assurance that our discussions and the interview process would remain confidential,” it said.“The Duke of York has on at least three occasions this year offered his assistance as a witness to the DoJ.”Citing breaches of confidentiality, a source said the DOJ had made it “incredibly difficult” for detailed discussions about the Duke’s contribution as a witness to take place. It is understood that US investigators are seeking to interview the Duke in person.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"search decade americas hunt secret 1m treasure trove ends triumph","story":"For a decade the treasure chest filled with gold, rubies, emeralds and diamonds hidden somewhere in the Rocky Mountains lay unclaimed. Tens of thousands searched for the riches. The quest led to lawsuits and even deaths, with some losing their lives as they looked. But the man who hid the jewels and left clues for their discovery, 89-year-old Forrest Fenn, has announced that the chase is now over. The chest has been found.“It was under a canopy of stars in the lush, forested vegetation of the Rocky Mountains and had not moved from the spot where I hid it more than 10 years ago,” Mr Fenn said as the news was announced on Sunday. “I do not know the person who found it, but the poem in my book led him to the precise spot.”Mr Fenn, an author and artifacts dealer who lives in the New Mexico city of Santa Fe, had hidden the spoils, worth an estimated $1 million, at an undisclosed location. He had included clues about where they could be found in a 24-line poem published in his 2010 autobiography The Thrill of the Chase. The search for the treasure had made headlines as America struggled with the impacts of recession and echoed the stories of frontiersmen in the country\u0027s past who went West seeking their fortune. An estimated 350,000 people from all over the world went hunting for the treasure, according to US media reports, though the true scale of interest is hard to verify. The New Mexican, a newspaper in Santa Fe, said at least five people had died searching for the chest and spoke to the author about the discovery. Mr Fenn told the paper that the chest had been found “a few days ago” but would not say where the treasure was located or who discovered it. “The guy who found it does not want his name mentioned. He’s from back East,” said Mr Fenn, who said a photograph provided proved the discovery had been made. Mr Finn announced the news on his website, declaring “the search is over” but urging others to continue to look for unknown treasures that could still be unclaimed in the mountains. He said: “I congratulate the thousands of people who participated in the search and hope they will continue to be drawn by the promise of other discoveries.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/08/16/selfie.jpg","title":"apple iphone selfie camera patent social distancing coronavirus","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Technology was proposed long before new coronavirus was discovered – but has been approved just as it looks more prescientApple has been granted a patent for a technology that would allow for synthetic group selfies.The feature would let people stitch together various images so that it looks like people were all together, even if they were actually apart.The patent was filed long before the new coronavirus was ever discovered.

The latest study, which involved 2,254 British adults, also revealed that around six in 10 people experienced worse sleep since lockdown began on 23 March.Charting Sweden’s no lockdown strategy“Nearly two-thirds of the UK public report some negative impact on their sleep from the Covid-19 crisis, clearly showing just how unsettling the pandemic and lockdown measures have been for a very large proportion of us,” said Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London.“And this is clearly tied to both how stressful we’ve found the virus itself, and how much we fear the impact of the lockdown on our employment and finances.”Data gathered in April by wearable technology firm Withings showed that people in the UK had been sleeping for 15 minutes longer on average each day during the lockdown.France saw the biggest increase in daily sleep times, with the average person sleeping for an extra 20 minutes each night.These findings can be partly explained by people not having to commute to work due to either working from home or not working at all during lockdown.Similar data from fitness tracking firm Polar revealed that people in Germany are also sleeping for longer.A significant increase in sleep time was recorded by Polar’s sleep-tracking devices as lockdown measures were introduced in Germany on 22 March.Researchers at University College London (UCL) are currently studying the effects lockdowns are having on people’s mental health.Early results suggest that higher levels of anxiety and depression are linked to lockdown restrictions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Musk urged employees to accelerate the development of the next-generation rocket dramatically and immediately.The internal email, which was obtained by CNBC, came just a week after SpaceX successfully launched two Nasa astronauts into orbit aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft to join the International Space Station (ISS).Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPlease consider the top SpaceX priority (apart from anything that could reduce Dragon return risk) to be Starship, he wrote in the email.SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.SpaceX Starship rocket explodes in dramatic fireballSpaceX first unveiled the Starship prototype in 2019, revealing a stainless steel spacecraft capable of carrying up to 100 people on missions to the moon and Mars.It is one of three major SpaceX projects, along with the Crew Dragon space program and the launch of the Starlink constellation, which aims to deliver 12,000 satellites into orbit for the purpose of beaming high-speed internet back down to Earth.Work on the Starship craft is currently split between SpaceX\u0027s Los Angeles headquarters, the Cape Canaveral launch site in Florida, and the Starship production complex near Austin, Texas.In order to advance the development of Starship, Mr Musk urged SpaceX employees to consider spending significant time in Texas.He wrote: For those considering moving, we will always offer a dedicated SpaceX aircraft to shuttle people.Created with Sketch.SpaceX Dragon heads back to earth after ISS mission Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with

current progress of space technology means that humans will not make it to Mars in his lifetime.Speaking at the Satellite 2020 conference in Washington in March, he revised previous estimates stated in 2018 that a SpaceX craft could be ready for a trip to Mars as early as 2025.The thing that concerns me most right now is that unless we improve our rate of innovation dramatically, there is no chance of a base on the moon or a city on Mars. This is my biggest concern, he told the audience.We\u0027ve got to improve our rate of innovation or, based on past trends, I am definitely going to be dead before Mars.The 48-year-old has frequently spoken of his ambition to die on Mars, though always with the caveat, just not on impact.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers have been unable to find how the bursts could be created, with the only certainty being that the very short but very powerful blasts must be emerging from some unknown, very extreme part of the universe.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe bursts come in a roughly 90 day window, which is then followed by a silent period for 67 days. The pattern then repeats, leaving a reliable 157 day period that was tracked over multiple years.That long pattern could suggest that the blasts are linked to the swirling, orbital motion of a massive star, a neutron star or a black hole.Mysterious signals coming from space answer matter puzzleThis is an exciting result as it is only the second system where we believe we see this modulation in burst activity, said Kaustubh Rajwade of The University of Manchester, who led the new research. Detecting a periodicity provides an important constraint on the origin of the bursts and the activity cycles could argue against a precessing neutron star.Fast radio bursts were first discovered in 2007, and were initially thought to be the result of a one-off event. Scientists then found in 2016 that FRB 121102 was in fact repeating.In the latest research, scientists then studied the source of the FRB using telescopes at Jodrell Bank, which allowed for regular monitoring over a long period that revealed the blast could be seen to be coming in a repeating patter when watched for a long time.This result relied on the regular monitoring possible with the Lovell Telescope, and non-detections were just as important as the detections, said Benjamin Stappers, who leads the MeerTRAP project to hunt for FRBs using the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, in a statement.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAdditionally, the new advice by WHO suggested that people over 60, as well as those in high-risk groups, should wear medical grade masks in cases where social distancing isn\u0027t possible.However concern remains that masks may themselves introduce risk factors – including making people feel less inclined to continue other measures like social distancing and hand washing.Mr Tedros added: “Our guidance also explains how to use a mask safely. People can potentially infect themselves if they use contaminated hands to adjust a mask, or to repeatedly take it off and put it on, without cleaning hands in between.“Masks can also create a false sense of security, leading people to neglect measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing. “I cannot say this clearly enough: masks alone will not protect you from Covid-19.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The announcement comes just a day after the UK government announced it would be making face coverings mandatory on public transport following months of claims the science was not clear on their effectiveness.“We are advising governments to encourage that the general public wear a mask. And we specify a fabric mask – that is, a non-medical mask,” the WHO’s technical lead expert on Covid-19, Maria van Kerkhove, added. “We have evidence now that if this is done properly it can provide a barrier... for potentially infectious droplets.”The UN agency’s advice that all healthcare workers dealing with Covid-19 patients, or with suspected cases of the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, should wear medical masks remains the same, Ms Van Kerkhove said.However, now that advice has been broadened to suggest staff coming into contact with any patients or residents in clinics, hospitals, care homes and long-term residential facilities should also wear masks at all times.Additional reporting by Reuters.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Schools may not fully reopen until after September, the health secretary has hinted amid concern from educators that it may be impossible to impose social distancing rules once classrooms are filled.Primary schools across the UK have already been given the green light to have some year six, year one and reception-aged children return to classes after months without formal education.However, the return has been far from universal – with a number of councils refusing to ask schools in their area to reopen amid concern from unions that it will be impossible to keep teachers and students safe from the virus which has claimed the lives of more than 40,000 across the country.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow the health secretary Matt Hancock has hinted that a full return to classrooms may not be possible when the next academic year begins – stating it is the “current working plan” for education to resume in September.Asked at the evening Downing Street press conference whether schools would be able to reopen fully in the new academic year with social distancing rules in place, Mr Hancock said: “That is our current working plan – that secondary schools won’t open until September at the earliest.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“I very much hope that they can because the impact on children’s education is so significant.“But what we have to do – not only in schools, but right across the board – is work out how we can get the other things that matter going.“Like schools, like hospitality – especially outdoor hospitality, like retail. And get them going safely and carefully, in a way that doesn’t lead to the spread of the virus, and that is going to require ingenuity.”Meanwhile, a source at the Department for Education told The Daily  that the “intention is to have “business as usual in all schools come September” but admitted there were no guarantees given the uncertainty about the infection rate.Confidence in UK’s handling of coronavirus crisis is lowest in worldIt comes after schools were urged to reconsider opening after it was thought the rate of reproduction of the virus – or R number – had risen beyond one in some areas like the north west, meaning it was increasingly spreading among the community.General secretary of teachers union NASUWT, Dr Patrick Roach, urged education providers to “fulfil their duty of care to staff and pupils by rethinking plans for the wider reopening of schools in their region” as a result.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing.

The Department of Justice is understood to have filed a mutual legal assistance (MLA) request to the Home Office, according to reports by The Sun as well as US broadcasters. An MLA is a method of seeking assistance from another state in an investigation or prosecution of criminal offences.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe request comes after Prince Andrew said last year that he would be willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.However, Geoffrey Berman, who is leading the Epstein probe, told reporters in March that the Duke of York was not willing to cooperate voluntarily with the investigation.

Prince Andrew has insisted that he did not witness or suspect any wrongdoing from Epstein, who killed himself in prison while waiting to be tried on sex trafficking charges. The prince also vehemently denies allegations that he had sex with Virginia Giuffre, also known as Virginia Roberts, in 2001 after she was trafficked to the UK by Epstein.She told BBC Panorama she felt “horrified and ashamed” after the alleged sexual encounter.

A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “As a matter of long-standing policy and practice, we neither confirm nor deny the existence of mutual legal assistance requests.” Similarly, the DOJ told The Independent: “As a matter of policy, the US Department of Justice does not publicly comment on communications with foreign governments on investigative matters, including confirming or denying the very existence of such communications.”A source close to the duke’s legal team told The Independent: “Legal discussions with the DOJ are subject to strict confidentiality rules, set out in their own guidelines.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Prince Andrew has tried to “falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate”, according to a US lawyer involved in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. His comments came after the Duke of York’s lawyers claimed the prince had offered to serve as a witness at least three times this year. Geoffrey Berman, who is leading the probe into sex trafficking allegations against Epstein and others, claimed a request to arrange an interview has repeatedly been turned down. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Today, Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate with an ongoing federal criminal investigation into sex trafficking and related offences committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates,” the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York said on Monday.“The prince has not given an interview to federal authorities, has repeatedly declined our request to schedule such an interview, and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally ... that he would not come in for such an interview.” Prince Andrew lawyers lash out at US justice department US prosecutors ‘request Prince Andrew answer questions on Epstein’Royals who stepped back from their duties before Harry and MeghanPrince Andrew won’t voluntarily cooperate in Epstein inquiryHe added: “If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open, and we await word of when we should expect him.”Mr Berman was responding to a statement the Duke of York’s lawyers put out on Monday, claiming the prince has offered to help with the investigation three times this year. “In doing so, they are perhaps seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proffered.”The US justice department has submitted a mutual legal assistance (MLA) request to the Home Office to quiz the Queen’s son as a witness in the probe into Epstein, who died in prison while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. An MLA request made by foreign countries is a formal process used to obtain help in an investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, generally when co-operation cannot be obtained by law enforcement agencies.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Fears are growing that some regions in the UK could be on the cusp of a second wave of Covid-19 infections after research suggested that the rate of infection was back to around one in the North West and the South West.It comes after thousands of sunseekers travelled to beauty spots across the south coast after the government announced days in advance that lockdown would be eased from  1 June.Following the move, crowds of revellers descended on Durdle Door in Dorset and other beaches last week to lap up the sun while enjoying drinks and picnics, in what amounted to a party-like atmosphere.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince then, council leaders and MPs have called on the government to take greater action to allow coastal communities to protect themselves against the virus.Last week, Brighton and Hove City Council called for the government to grant it more powers to implement its own lockdown measures in a bid to keep visitors of its beach.Hundreds ignore police warnings and flock to beach at Durdle DoorMeanwhile, Dorset Council leader Spencer Flower wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging him to limit travel to within the home counties, warning that lockdown rules have a disproportionately negative impact on coastal communities.“I am worried that we will see a second wave of infection here in Dorset as a result of the high number of visitors to the area over recent days,” Mr Flower wrote.“I’m asking the government to act now to save the lives of Dorset residents. My plea to the government is to review the unrestricted travel guidelines currently in place and require people instead to stay local.”With summer fast approaching and the R rate appearing to be on the rise in two regions, could the UK shut its beaches in the event of a second wave?Police officer kicked in the face after dispersing beach gatheringThe ownership of Britain’s beaches is complicated, with many sites not in public ownership. It is estimated that the Crown Estate controls around 45 per cent of England’s foreshore.The remaining 55 per cent lays in the hands of the National Trust, the Ministry of Defence and other organisations as well as private iniduals. This means that it is not always in the power of local authorities to shut beaches.One council in the South West of England told The Independent that it could only shut its beaches in a state of emergency.A spokesperson for No.10 said it was up to councils to decide whether or not to close beaches.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Japan is currently the UK’s 11th largest trading partner, and the fourth largest outside the EU.  Ministers say the new deal could help the UK as it recovers from the economic shock created by the coronavirus crisis. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the talks will open as the government comes under increasing pressure to help the economy by extending the transition period, a move Boris Johnson has categorically ruled out. Negotiations between the UK and Japan will be conducted remotely, via videoconference, as the world continues to fight the global pandemic. Both countries want to secure an agreement by the end of this year – although that timeline is described as ambitious. NHS stockpiles meant for no-deal Brexit ‘used up entirely’ by Covid-19It is not too late to protect British jobs from the shock of BrexitLet’s hope Johnson is now waking up to the harm of a no-deal BrexitAre the Brexit negotiations really going to crash?Fears of no-deal Brexit rise as talks round ends in acrimonyAny new arrangement will build on the existing trade deal between the EU and Japan, but go further in areas such as digital trade.  Ministers believe the talks will also take the UK one step closer to its aim of joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a trade agreement that stretches from Australia to Chile.  The government says a bilateral trade deal could bolster GDP by around 0.07 per cent, or £1.5bn, in the long-term. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: “This deal will provide more opportunities for businesses and iniduals across every region and nation of the UK and help boost our economies following the unprecedented economic challenges posed by coronavirus.” Takaaki Hanaoka, secretary general of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce \u0026amp Industry in the UK said a dal should be struck “at the earliest opportunity.” Josh Hardie, CBI Deputy Director-General, said Japan offered “huge opportunities” for UK businesses.

Even though he was polite, on every occasion he was weird.“He was memorable to look at. The blond hair with striking blue eyes.“But he would just stare at me in a sleazy way for a minute or two without saying a word and not release his gaze.“It was bizarre and made me feel very uncomfortable. His eyes chilled me to the bone.”Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B trained as a car mechanic, and first fled to Lagos in Portugal with a girlfriend after serving part of a two-year sentence for child abuse in .In , he was caught by Portuguese cops and deported to Germany under a European Arrest Warrant.After being released from jail, he ed to Portugal and settled in Praia da Luz, working as a waiter and selling advertising for English newspapers during a -year stint at the resort where the McCanns took their fateful holiday.The suspect has been branded a #sexual predator# who abused young girls and rapist banged up for attacking a -year-old tourist in Portugal.Heres all the latest updates this evening.KATE and Gerry McCann suffered another setback on Saturday when Hans Christian Wolters, of the Braunschweig Public Prosecutors Office, said in relation to their new prime suspect: “What we have is not enough for an arrest warrant or an indictment.#Christian B was named as the prime suspect in Madeleines disappearance this week with prosecutors in Germany investigating him #on suspicion of murder#.MADELEINE McCann suspect Christian B could escape with just  years behind barshe is ever tried and convicted of her murder.If the case was held in the UK then a guilty verdict would result in a mandatory le sentence.But German law now bans the extradition of suspects to Britain for criminal trials.That means Christian B, , will stand trial in Germany #the Federal Police there secure enough evidence to charge him for Maddie’s  abduction.And in Germany a murder conviction attracts a jail sentence of  years but is suspended after just .That means Christian B would walk free after almost the sameof time that Maddie has now been missing.The extradition process is dealt with under Germany’s Basic Law, Article , which states: #No German may be extradited to foreign countries.#By law, a dferent arrangement may be made for extradition to a Member State of the European Union or to an international court, provided that the rule of law is respected.”THE adoptive mum of Christian B has told friends her #le has been destroyed# as he was named chief suspect in Madeleine McCanns disappearance.Widowed Brigitte is said to be in #utter dismay# at the revelation her estranged adopted sun is at the heart of police investigations.Christian B and his brother were adopted in the late s by Brigitte and her husband, Fritz # who died three years ago.But he is said to have turned into a delinquent after Fritz suffered brain damage in an accident in , leaving him in a wheelchair.A pal told the Daily Mail: #Brigitte is an elderly lady and is very confused.

He always beat them.#Once she even had strangles on her neck.#KATE MCCANN once wrote about her #horror# that a worker at their Praia da Luz holiday complex may have accidentally informed Madeleines suspected abductor that she, her husband Gerry and pals ate out each night.A former Ocean Club worker tipped off main suspect Christian B that Madeleine had been left alone, it was claimed over the weekend.Police sources believe the insider had Christian Bs old Portuguese mobile phone details — one of two numbers revealed by UK cops last week — in his diary.But a member of staff at the complex may also have alerted Christian B by making a note in a staff register that was open for all to see, Sky News reports.In her book, Madeleine, Kate McCann wrote: #It wasnt until a year later, when I was combing through the Portuguese files, that I discovered that the note requesting our block booking was written in a staff message book, which sat on a desk at the pool reception for most of the day.#We wanted to eat close to our apartments as we were leaving our young children alone there and checking on them intermittently.#Mrs McCann added she thought the message book entry had been made #in all innocence#.GERMAN prosecutors handling the Madeleine McCann case are said to be #absolutely certain# that Christian B is the #right man#, it is claimed.But there is not yet an arrest warrant out for the suspect, who is still in prison serving a sentence for other offences,and has not been charged over the little girls disappearance.Today, Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of German newspaper BILD, told Good Morning Britain: “Investigators and prosecutors here are absolutely certain they have the right man but so far they haven’t charged him.“There isn’t even an arrest warrant on him which isn’t necessary because he’s in jail anyhow for another charge.“But so far, they are still missing the one important thing which would be either the body or a confession by Christian B.“So far, we have learned that they haven’t even talked to Christian B, they haven’t even questioned him already because they are still trying to put together more and more of the pieces so they can put pressure on him and maybe get a confession from him.#GERMAN prosecutors believe there are more victims linked to Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B.Hans Christian Wolters, Braunschweig state prosecutor, said: #We assume there are more victims.#And he said that the suspect has not yet been questioned by police over Madeleines disappearance.The senior prosecutor said: #It is currently a circumstantial suspicion.#We have not yet questioned the suspect in this case.#CHRISTIAN B could be extradited to Portugal under a European Arrest Warrant.But cops are still hunting for definitive proof in the case.Under German law, he could not be extradited to Britain, German news site Op-Onloine reports.#It is not enough for an arrest warrant or an indictment,# said Hans Christian Wolters of the Braunschweig public prosecutors office.German prosecutors believe Madeleine is dead.COURT documents seen by The Sun revealed that a German pal, who alerted cops about Christian Bs  rape of a widow in Praia da Luz, told how the suspect would brag he had broken into some villas while the occupants were inside.Christian B. ed to Germany in the late s, telling pals hed made thousands from his burglaries.A former friend said: #He was helping himself to cash, jewellery, electronic items. #He used the money to buy drugs and sell them on.#CHRISTIAN B led a search party to find a teenage girl who had fled a foster home in the months after Madeleine disappeared and found her in a nearby seaside town.It is understood the girl was pregnant when she ed # with Christian B leaving the area soon after.One local said: #He found her. She was in Lagos with a group of Romanians, and from what I’ve heard at the time, when she got back to the house, she was pregnant.#Then the teenager disappeared and then this guy disappeared. I assumed she was taken back to Germany given the circumstances that she was pregnant.#Another woman, who would eat at the restaurant where Christian B worked, wept as she said: #I don’t want to relive this man. The destruction he has caused. The things he had done. I cannot bear to think of it.”GERMAN authorities are said to ignored warnings from police that Christian B may have killed Madeleine McCann.A report from detectives who were tracking him said seven years ago he was a key suspect, it is reported.But the lead was ignored by Germanys Federal Criminal Office, news magazine Der Spiegel claims.The report came after British detectives made a fresh appeal for information on a German Crimewatch-style TV programme.MEANWHILE, Christian B was feared to be a gun-toting criminal,  according to residents in the Portuguese village he stayed at shortly after Madeleines disappearance.But Portuguese cops have not yet visited Foral to speak to locals about the suspect.Foral is about  miles from Praia da Luz, the resort where Madeleine vanished in .#Everyone was absolutely terried when he was around because he used to carry a gun,” said Lia Silva, a local woman.Christian B is also said to have taken part in a local search to find a missing teenager.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All the other drivers on the motorway could see it too. But the Tesla, bombing along at around mph, with its self-drive autopilot system engaged, did NOT see it.It even went straight past the driver of the overturned truck who was at the side of the road, a good distance from the crash site, frantically warning oncoming motorists to slow down. And then came the impact.Luckily, no one was hurt. But the accident does serve as a useful reminder about technology. It can make le fun and it can make le convenient. But we’ve not yet reached a point where we can rely on it to behave itself. Take the wi in your house.The box sits in a cupboard, I should imagine, where there’s no wind or rain or weather of any kind. It is never bashed or dropped. And yet somehow, once a fortnight, it will suddenly stop working. There is no reason for this.In my London flat, the windows also serve as radiators. They are designed to come on in October and go off again in April.But every year, they get it the wrong way round and no one is able to stop them doing this, boiling me in the summer and sitting there in the winter while I slowly die of hypothermia.My laptop is no better. The last one became critically ill recently, so before it died completely, all of its information was transferred on to the model I’m using now.And that, about once a day, decides to freeze. Control-Alt-Delete  Forget it. It becomes as receptive as a brick. We have all experienced these things. And we have to believe the owner of that Tesla in Taiwan has as well.Yet he engaged the car’s self-drive system and sat back, assuming it would be able to see a crashed van directly ahead. Had he not researched the car at all  I know Tesla says its autonomous system is nine times safer than a human. But a quick Google search would suggest that sometimes, like all technology, it isn’t safe at all.I actually quite like Tesla’s current range of cars. I think they are interesting and fun and I can see why, in lockdown, the Model  was the best-selling car in Britain. But I have a word of warning for anyone tempted to buy one and engage its autopilot: Don’t.Think of it as the tool you get on a Swiss Army kne that can be used for getting stones out of a horse’s hoof. It’s a talking point . . . but you’d never actually use it.IT has been the biggest police manhunt in history. But now, after a multimillion-pound, -year search across  countries, there appears to be a genuine breakthrough in the search for Madeleine McCann.That’s great. But what staggers me is that the new chief suspect Christian B was living just a few miles from the Portuguese resort where she was last seen. His phone puts him in the resort itself on the night of the abduction.He was even interviewed by Plod back in . And it’s not like he was a model citizen. Described as a burglar and a drug dealer, it’s known he was also a paedophile. He’s even doing time in Germany right now for child sex offences. And yet somehow he was never arrested.It makes me wonder. Will they find Lord Lucan living next door to the house from which he fled in  And will it turn out that “Mr Herring” who rides around Fulham every day on a horse called Shiregar is actually the mysterious Mr Kipper who is said to have abducted Suzy Lamplugh back in  THE Hungarian justice minister Judit Varga responded angrily this week to claims her country had become a dictatorship.I’m not sure what she said, though.

She hid in bushes for five hours, before running into the road to wave down a passing truck.She later said: It was either run, or be raped and killed.Falconios body has never been found.Lees is said to be living in a two-bedroom terrace house in her hometown of Huddersfield.She says she lives an isolated le as a social worker at the Directorate for Children and Young People for Kirklees Council.She has had ious jobs – including working at a travel agency and supporting the disabled after ing to college to study sociology.The -year-old has never married or had children following the tragic death of her boyfriend.In , she flew her back to Australia to where her boyfriend was shot in the hopes of finding his body and bringing him home to lay to rest.During the search, she discovered that she had a mirror-image sister called Jess.

Boris wants distancing cut to one metre, giving the all-clear for pubs and restaurants to reopen and start rehiring the millions laid off since lockdown.Rishi Sunak is counting on this to trim Treasury job-support measures costing the economy a dizzying £billion.It will kickstart a new-normal summer, with open-air weddings, beer-garden service and marquees to protect punters from the rain.Summer holidays are back on track after being stymied for weeks.Airlines will bypass quarantine with air corridors to approved holiday destinations such as Italy, France, Greece and Turkey.These measures are not risk-free.

I wanted to give some people hope.Despair was written all over the newspaper headlines.And secondly, we’re an overweight society – I think not only in this country, but the world.He added: So I wanted to get the kids away from their electronic gadgets … and out into the sunshine, out into the mountains, hiking, fishing, picnicking – and anything but the couch.Get out of the game room.Controversy has also dogged the search as numerous people have ended up in legal trouble.Treasure hunters have landed in hot water for digging holes in state land or having to be rescued by the authorities.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A delaying-the-inevitable tactic which meant, by the time Phil and Dennis’s tickets for the April  game between West Ham and Burnley arrived in mid May, the fixture was as dead as Dennis.A lucky escapeyou ask me.The day of reckoning, when it runs out of episodes, fast approaches, of course. For the duration of the outbreak, though, it’s been a biological miracle.Regulars have packed The Vic, mobbed the Bridge Street market and just stood around gawping and muttering, in their usual community-serving way, when Keegan’s sandwich van was trashed by the local drug dealers.The presence of a global pandemic hasn’t stopped EastEnders lecturing us about other medical issues, obviously.Since the boat party accident, in February, it’s been particularly concerned about Ben Mitchell’s deafness, which cut no ice with me for a couple of good reasons.Firstly, Ben Mitchell is a dreadful, immoral, six-headed little turd who it’s impossible to like, let alone love.Secondly, they’d forgotten he was partially deaf for most of the previous decade.There’s not an international crisis or continuity glitch in the universe that can stand in the way of EastEnders’ moral grandstanding, though, so they decided viewers should “see and hear” last week’s heist episode, with Barry Grant off Brookside, through the eyes and ears of Ben.A particularly gormless enterprise, this one, which went off like Norman Collier and Jimi Hendrix on the same bill at The Half Moon in Putney, and was all feedback and missing words.To ram home the message for the hard of thinking, the action was also accompanied by word cloud subtitles that appeared to have been written by Tarzan.“Keep mind on job.”“Cut power.”“Ben, this mistake.”“Daughter without father.”Compared with other EastEnders episodes, I enjoyed it a lot. I usually do when the show tries something a bit dferent and thought you could actually write the entire history of the show in half a dozen lines of this new Tarzan-speak.“Den hate Angie.” “Peter change head.” “Phil. Him shot.” “You not mother.” “Me am mother.” “Peter change head again.” “Get out pub.” It’d be timely as well. After  years and four months of almost constant shouting and stall-minding, EastEnders goes off air next week.Tantalisingly, The Sun’s very own Andy Halls reported, on Friday, that when it s the show will have dropped its old storylines. A dream scenario which allowed me to fantasise about EastEnders ..

All deserve our sympathy. SOS was meant to be a Euro  spin-off and when the tournament vanished so did the show’s point. Camera angles also seem to have gone to hell, but that’s maybe an act of socially distanced mercy given what’s happening front and centre.Saturday’s content included: A teabag- flipping contest between Mo Farah and Ellie Simmonds, parachuting with Jermaine Jenas, which was straight off the Alan Partridge script and foul-mouthed football “bantz” from Rio Ferdinand, who said his career was ended by Peter Crouch, so may have been playing keepy-uppy to the Match Of The Day theme tune as some sort of twisted payback.The really alarming thing, though, is the series lasts eight weeks.Save Our Summer  At this rate, there’ll be a dark cloud hanging over autumn as well.For the record, it was the BBC News.SPRINGWATCH’s Steve Backshall wearing a “No planet B” T-shirt like he’s a -year-old student, rather than a -year-old BBC presenter who won’t shut up about his three kids. Bafta giving nominations to The Greatest Dancer and The Ranganation but not a Best Drama nod to Line Of Duty.This Morning’s Phillip Schofield losing his very short temper with John Torode over yoghurt dressing. Anyone who says “chowing down” instead of eating. And the clearly smitten GMB host Susanna Reid making an involuntary groping gesturewith her left hand, just after she says the name Keir Starmer. Easy tiger.PETER Crouch: “It wasn’t all about improving, it was also about getting better.”Ian Wright: “The one thing about Gerrard was his professionalism and the fact he was so versatile.”Paul Merson: “It was definitely half an open goal.”                                 SKY Documentaries’ McMillion, the best show on TV.Ralph’s wedding on The A Word. ITV’s th birthday tribute to the great Bradley Walsh.The GMB spat between Piers Morgan and Donald Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, which had everything except the obvious reprimand: “Rudy. Stop your messin’ around.”And Channel ’s Murder In The Outback, where disgraced Australian lawyer Andrew Fraser proves, beyond much forensic doubt, Bradley Murdoch did indeed kill Peter Falconio.The only slight glitch being, he’s trying to prove the exact opposite.Watch it, Channel , tonight and tomorrow, pm. The self-delusion becomes hypnotic. A Gillian Burke on Springwatch B Connell Waldron on Normal People C Comedian Tom Allen on nearly everything MOST surprising thing about Britain’s Best Parent  Anita Rani isn’t the most annoying person on this Channel  show.In fact, she’s not even close to a medal position thanks to the other five – two couples and a single mum – who must champion their own style of parenting, whether  it’s “pushy” or “vegan” or mollycoddling or just sort of lying around in bed all day treating their offspring as the hired help.Like the rest of us, Channel  silently understands, of course, listening to strangers talk about their small children is no more engaging or enlightening than listening to a ­scientologist talk about L. Ron Hubbard, so they’ve included a few eccentrics to liven  up the process.On the one hand there’s martial arts enthusiast Robin, who explains: “Our parenting style is influenced by eastern philosophy. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism,” ventriloquism, egotism, Roxette’s fourth album Tourism.On the other there’s gender fluid feminist nut Joana, who is attempting to bring up five-year-old son Willow as “a free spirit”, by banning the word “boy”, refusing to buy him “militaristic toys” and plastering her house in idiotic Socialist Worker propaganda.Hopefully, little Willow will be a stalwart of his local golf club and TA unit  in about  years’ time.But that’s no real saving grace for the show, nor a reason to watch any part of Britain’s Best Parent, apart from the final vote where, every week, the studio audience has to choose between those “free spirits” who let the kids rule the roost and those couples, like David and Nicky, who run their house more like an SAS boot camp.And every week, I’m happy to report, they vote for the boot camp.All hope for Britain may not be lost.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We need to clearly understand what role children and schools plan in transmission of the virus.“More data collection is crucial to reassure people that it is safe for schools to reopen and carefully monitor their impact on Covid spread.“This will tell us how rapidly we can get children back into school.”Community surveillance by the Office for National Statistics has already found the number of infected people in England has halved in two weeks.Officials say there were an estimated , new infections per week, or , a day, from April  to May .Speaking at the Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock announced an extension of Covid testing in English care homes.He said working age adult care homes would now be included.Ministers have already sent testing kits for all residents and staff in elderly care settings by their early June target date.Mr Hancock said: “We will now make sure that we do all of this in working age care homes as well.I can announce that from today all remaining adult care homes in England will be able to order the whole care home testing service for residents and staff.This service will benefit residents and staff in over , more care homes. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You dumb s*** you f****** p****. I hope you f***ing die!”In the back, a small child can be seen watching the bitter clash.After her tantrum the woman begins to drive towards the queue, but is blocked again by the employee.The stand-off continues, and another woman gets out of the car and appears to shove the employee out of the way.At this point the manager arrives and shouts: “I am not serving you!” As the argument continues. The professional employees stand firm and refuse to let the women join the queue.This sends the older woman into a tirade as she slaps and grabs the McDonald’s employee and shouts: “f*** you!” repeatedly. Eventually the women back off and the incident comes to an end.Clips of the abuse were uploaded to Facebook and posted publicly by Shyaan Anais Salih shortly after.Shyaan posted: “I am disgusted with what I witnessed today!This person told this McDonald’s worker that she was driving into Krispy Kreme when she was deliberately trying to enter the McDonald’s drive-thru. “The drive-thru line was closed off due to build up of traffic happening on the A, hence why her, and the cars behind werent allowed.

The crowdfunded legal challenge is being brought by the Doctors’ Association UK, Hourglass Abuse, and the Good Law Project. Their legal bid claims that thehe Department of Health’s has  legal obligation to launch an investigation into whether failures to provide adequate PPE may have caused or contributed to the deaths or serious illness from COVID- of workers in the health and social care sectors, as well as patients. They launched their legal action after government lawyers said an inquiry was unnecessary. Ministers have said setting up the investigation would distract the Department of Health and Social Careand other key bodies involved in arranging the supply of PPE or guidance about what kit should be used. The group claim that there have been at least  deaths of NHS staff and  deaths of social care workers in England. Dr Rinesh Parmar, Chair of the Doctors’ Association UKsaid: We have seen over the last few weeks that the UK has one of the highest death rates from COVID- in the world. Health and social care workers rose to the challenge, ed to the frontline from retirement and pulled out all the stops to save lives. Some had no personal protective equipment , others had inadequate, out of date perishing supplies.  Alongside caring for patients, we’ve cared for colleagues and also faced the sad and grim reality of losing colleagues, who themselves were caring for patients. Now is the time to learn key lessons to enable us to avoid future pitfalls, protect the frontline and ultimately save lives.

The Health Secretary accepted a Public Health England model last week showed R - the number of people each carrier infects - was . in the South West and . in the North West. But he insisted the model was one of just ten on the R rate, and overall, the consensus view is that R is below one in every region of the UK.He did not give exact figures, but told the Commons it was wrong to focus only on one model.Speaking as daily deaths across the UK fell to , the lowest single day since lockdown, he added:Coronavirus is in retreat across the land. Our plan is working and these downward trends mean we can proceed with our plans. But we do so putting caution and safety first. However,  Mr Hancock warned the  daily deaths would rise again because todayaposs figure was for Sunday - which is always lower due to reporting delays. He added: “Each death brings just as much sadness as when the figure was much higher in the peak”.It comes after the UK’s Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesfound the R was .-. in the UK, and slightly higher for England at .-. That estimate was partly made through modelling by Public Health England and Cambridge University’s MRC Biostatistics Unit. That estimated the R number as being a median of . in the North West and . in the South West. The findings prompted alarm from northern leaders who warned it showed lockdown was being eased too quickly in England. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram warned the R change as signicant. They warned yesterday: The spread of the virus ies widely within regions and even within local authority areas. To this point, however, the public have been given very little localised information. But Mr Hancock today insisted that overall, the R number was below  in each region of the UK. The Health Secretary appeared to blame the media for reporting the information, which was provided to the media in a press release from Public Health England. He said: It is important that the media reports the facts, which are thatyou take into account all these models, then R is below one according to SAGE in each region of the country.  Of course scientic models will come out with dferent results. And itaposs quite right the scientists should publish and discuss those - thataposs how science advances. But itaposs also important that the media play their part responsibly. He added: The way you get the best advice is by looking at all dferent models, rather than just one. Mr Hancock also clashed with an MP who he accused of misquoting one of the governmentaposs scientic advisors. SNP MP Neale Hanvey said growing number of experts were warning of a “signicant second wave” He added: SAGE member John Edmunds told Andrew Marr the decision not to lock down earlier had ‘cost a lot of lives’. He went on: If the government is no longer following the science provided by their own advisors, whose advice are they following  Mr Hancock said Mr Hanvey had “misquoted” one of the professors he referred to in his question and did not elaborate further. He added: “I’m afraid the honourable gentleman has misquoted Prof Edmunds and I think he should go and look at what was actually said.” Yet Prof Edmunds clearly said: We should have gone into lockdown earlier. I think it would have been hard to do it, I think the data we were dealing with in early parts of March and our situational awareness was really quite poor. And so I think it would have been very hard to pull the trigger at that point. But I wish we had, I wish we had gone into lockdown earlier. I think that has cost a lot of lives, unfortunately.” The government is preparing to allow non-essential shops to reopen from June  - along with places of worship for private prayer. People will be forced by law to wear face coverings on public transport for the first time. But Downing Street today accepted its own coronavirus aposalertapos level could still be at  - which it has been since March - when that happens. Boris Johnson ’s spokesperson has said changes to lockdown measures are “guided by the scientic and medical advice” and the separate five tests for easing lockdown.The spokesman said that while the decision on reopening is conditional it wouldnapost necessarily be accompanied by a drop to level three in the warning system.

Ms Patel said that  protesters had been arrested and  police officers injured during protests. Mostly peaceful protests took place in cities across the UK over the weekend, but a small number of rallies saw clashes between campaigners and police. Ms Patel, making a statement to MPs, said any large gatherings of people are currently unlawful before adding: We cannot afford to forget weaposre still in the grip of an unprecedented national health emergency that has tragically claimed more than , lives. So the severe public health risk forces me to continue to urge the public not to attend future protests. The Governmentaposs scientic and medically-led advice remains clear and consistent - no matter how important the cause, protesting in large numbers at this exceptional time is illegal and doing so puts everyoneaposs lives at risk. But MPaposs clashed over the Governmentaposs response to the protesters. Labouraposs Flo Eshalomi challenged Ms Patelaposs account and said the government did not understand racial inequality. Ms Patel rejected the claim and spoke about her own experience of racism. She added: Well, on that basis, it must have been a very dferent Home Secretary who as a child was frequently called a Paki in the playground, a very dferent Home Secretary who was racially abused in the streets or even advised to drop her surname and use her husbands in order to advance her career. A dferent Home Secretary recently characterised,madame deputy speaker I can say so, in thenewspaper as a fat cow with a ring through its nose - something that was not only racist but offensive, both culturally and religiously. Labouraposs Nick Thomas-Symonds told the Commons said that MPs couldnapost ignore the demands of protesters for change. He said: We cannot allow this moment of global demand for justice to pass without action and we on these benches will be at the forefront of calls for change.  What is never the solution, though, is violence and vandalism. The vast majority of protesters are peaceful, but some of the actions we have seen from a minority are unacceptable.

A modelling study from Imperial College London scientists, involving data from  European countries up to early May , found that lockdowns had a substantial effect in reducing transmission levels of Covid-. European countries began implementing social distancing, school closures and national lockdowns in March, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson putting the UK in lockdown on March , a date critics say was too late after a delay that cost lives. The Imperial researchers estimate that across all  countries - the UK, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland - between  and  million people were infected with Covid- up to May , representing between .% and .% of the population. Their analysis suggests . million lives were saved across the continent, including , in the UK, , in France and , in Italy. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   In their paper, published in the Nature journal, they said the results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions and lockdown in particular have had a large effect on reducing transmission. The paper says: Continued intervention should be considered to keep transmission of SARS-CoV- under control. By comparing the deaths predicted under a model with no interventions to the deaths predicted in an intervention model, the researchers calculated that . million deaths have been averted across the  countries due to interventions since the beginning of the epidemic.  Dr Samir Bhatt, study author from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Jameel Institute , Imperial College London, said: This data suggests that without any interventions, such as lockdown and school closures, there could have been many more deaths from Covid-. The rate of transmission has declined from high levels to ones under control in all European countries we study. Our analysis also suggests far more infections in these European countries than previously estimated.  Careful consideration should now be given to the continued measures that are needed to keep SARS-CoV- transmission under control. The publication of the research comes after Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted the Government made the right decisions at the right time with the lockdown, despite a leading scientist saying lives would have been saved had ministers acted sooner. Infectious diseases expert, Professor John Edmunds, who attends meetings of the Governmentaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , told BBC Oneaposs The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: We should have gone into lockdown earlier. I think it would have been hard to do it, I think the data that we were dealing with in the early part of March and our kind of situational awareness was really quite poor. And so I think it would have been very hard to pull the trigger at that point but I wish we had - I wish we had gone into lockdown earlier. I think that has cost a lot of lives unfortunately. Meanwhile, a second study from the University of Calornia, looking at China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the United States, estimates that interventions in those countries prevented or delayed around  million cases.

Lina Sapia, , has beat the staggering one in  million odds by naturally conceiving the babies - something she thought wasnapost possible after needing IVF to conceive her first born Alba, one. The stay-at-home mum and her husband Fabio, , wanted to extend their family and planned on using one of the four frozen embryos but were pleasantly surprised to two lines on a pregnancy test in September . The couple were in total shock when they saw three heartbeats at their six-week scan. Lina, from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, said: We were trying for three years before we decided to have IVF with Alba which was successful first time.  We always knew we wanted to have another baby and assumed we will need to go through IVF again after being diagnosed with unexplained infertility. I experienced a second miscarriage three months prior to discovering I was pregnant with triplets in September but I didnapost get my hopes up as I feared it may happen again. We booked in for an early scan at six weeks to check the baby was healthy and the nurse kept asking me questions such as have I been feeling sick  To which I said no but I did feel slightly bigger than before - I constantly looked bloated like I had eaten a huge plate of pasta. She went to get a second opinion and said thereaposs more than one heartbeat, so we assumed two, not three! We were in total shock and couldnapost believe it - Fabio, who is a risk analyst, was nervously laughing in the corner. We felt like we had won the lottery - neither of us have multiples in the family!  Medics prepared the couple for the worst as triplet pregnancies have a high risk of miscarriage. Thankfully, there wasnapost any complications and Lina gave birth at  weeks to Luis who weighed lb  oz, Piero,  lb oz and Remi,  lb oz. The couple admit they still get confused with who is who at times and the -week-old triplets still wear velcro wrist bands with their initial on to ensure they are not mixed up. She adds: I felt anxious throughout the pregnancy as I feared something bad may happen and I couldnapost deal with another miscarriage. But we had scans every two weeks to ensure everything was fine - it was incredible watching them grow. My bump became heavy and uncomfortable towards the end but I persevered as I still needed to be a mum to Alba and keep her entertained. They were born on March  - and thankfully our parents were able to meet them before the UK went into lockdown.  The triplets were like superstars at St Peters, Chertsey, Surrey as many of the staff hadnapost seen identical triplets before. Fabio wasnapost allowed to see them for three weeks whilst they were in hospital due to the restrictions - only via FaceTime which was dficult. The NHS were absolutely incredible for not only getting us through the pregnancy but also providing  hour care when they were born.

This really is the last generation prepared to live their lives bound by the shackles of institutional racism.

In the UK, as protesters of all races, young and old, mobilised across the country, I started to believe. More than that, I found myself suppressing a lump in my throat. Change is being demanded across every strata of our society. The structures that have left black people without a voice in power bases across a iety of industries in the modern world, are being challenged. That brutal footage of George Floyd being killed by US police has inspired the world to declare enough is enough.  I’ve seen my optimism crushed before of course – after the four officers who brutally beat Rodney King on film were cleared in . Crushed again after the politan Police vowed to act on the Macpherson Report – set up after the Stephen Lawrence murder – which declared the force was institutionally racist in , only for more black men to die in police custody. Crushed again after the Tottenham riots sparked mayhem across the country in  and calls for change were quickly forgotten. And after the footballer Raheem Sterling called out the negative depiction of black men in the media in December . Warm words followed with a few appointments in newsrooms to ease consciences – but little . This, though, feels dferent. Ordinary black people might not have the financial security of Star Wars actor John Boyega, but they are motivated by his insistence on speaking out despite fearing he’d put his career at risk.  Friends of mine are now doing the same. Calling out their employers, challenging friends on their language and attitudes. Books about race are among the most popular on Amazon right now as white people educate themselves on the pain of their black acquaintances. People now want to learn about the subconscious bias that reinforces attitudes, halts the progression of black people in the workplace, leaves them more vulnerable to health problems and more likely to be discriminated against by the police. Organisations and media outlets trying to jump on the bandwagon with empty words and little action are being called out for their hypocrisy. Next in line are politics, education, health.

Investigators want the duke, who they view as a witness, to tell them about his dealings with Epstein and those he met in America and Britain. US agents hope Andrew could help them snare a “spider’s web” of what is thought to be up to  of the dead billionaire’s enablers. Officers think Andrew may have come into contact with at least six of them. The Department of Justice in New York, which is leading the investigation into Epstein’s crimes, has filed a Mutual Legal Assistance request to the British government. It is a bid to force the duke to supply a statement. The tactics have sparked a fierce attack by the duke’s legal team who insist he has offered to talk to investigators. But New York state prosecutor Geoffrey Berman, who is heading the inquiry into Epstein, has hit back. He said: “Prince Andrew yet again sought to ly portray himself to the public as eager and willing to co-operate with an investigation into sex trafficking and related offences committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.” He added the prince “has not given an interview to federal authorities, has repeatedly declined our request to schedule an interview, and nearly four months ago informed us he would not come in for such an interview”.  If the MLA application is successful, agents could ask Andrew for mobile phone records as well as financial documents. Epstein’s victims have welcomed the US government’s demand the prince be handed over to give evidence to the FBI. But Andrew’s legal team hit out at claims there had been a “wall of silence”. London law firm Blackfords, which has been retained by the duke, said: “As the public record indicates the DOJ has been actively investigating Mr Epstein and other targets for more than  years, yet the first time they requested the duke’s help was nd January .  “Importantly, the DOJ advised us that the duke is not and has never been a ‘target’ of their criminal investigations into Epstein and that they sought his confidential, voluntary co-operation. “We asked the DOJ to confirm our co-operation and any interview arrangements would remain confidential, in accordance with the rules that apply to voluntary co-operation with the DOJ. “We were given an unequivocal assurance that our discussions and the interview process would remain confidential.” They added the duke has on at least three occasions this year offered his assistance as a witness.  Blackfords said: “The DOJ reacted to the first two offers by breaching their own confidentiality rules and claiming the duke has offered zero co-operation. “In doing so, they are perhaps seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proffered.” In January and March, Mr Berman said the prince had refused to co-operate. But Andrew’s lawyers yesterday said “these statements were inaccurate”, adding: “Far from our client acting above the law, as has been implied..., he is being treated by a lower standard than might reasonably be expected for any other citizen.” An MLA allows co-operation between countries when evidence needs to be gathered in a criminal investigation.  If approved by the Home Office, the FBI could ask Andrew, , to go to a UK court to give evidence under oath as a witness. US Attorney General William Barr said yesterday there are no plans to try to extradite him for questioning. Sources have told the Mirror the FBI has whittled down Epstein’s inner circle to those they now think could be charged with facilitating the American’s alleged abuse of scores of teenage girls. An insider said: “Agents have built a spider’s web of people they believe are involved – in the centre is Epstein. It shows who is connected to who.  Andrew is on the periphery web. At least six of the people are known to have socialised with him, flown with or come into contact with him and who the FBI believes could be charged.” It has been reported the FBI is investigating Andrew’s pal British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and others linked to Epstein. Ms Maxwell has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing. US lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents five of Epstein’s accusers, told the Mirror that George Floyd’s death in America has given strength to victims that justice will be served. She also represents someone who claims to have seen Andrew with Virginia Giuffre in Tramp nightclub in London in  the night Virginia claims she had sex with the prince when she was .  The duke has vehemently denied her allegations as well as two further claims she went on to have sex with Andrew in Epstein’s homes in New York and on his private Caribbean island. Andrew told Newsnight in November: “I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady.” Ms Giuffre claims she was Epstein’s sex slave. Epstein, , who was convicted in  of procuring a minor for prostitution, was found hanged in his cell in New York last August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Ms Bloom said: “If we have learned anything from the protests over the last week, it’s that no one in authority should be above the law. “Decency demands our countries co-operate in this investigation and require Prince Andrew to sit and answer questions and produce documents and information like any other citizen. “On behalf of the witness who says she [saw] Andrew and Virginia together at the nightclub in , we are encouraged by this move.” Attorney Jack Scarola, who has worked on behalf of victims for years, said: “For more than a decade victims of Epstein’s abuse and exploitation have stood by in frustration as one hope for justice after another has been dashed. While the tide seems to be turning in their favour, their optimism is tempered with great caution.” "},{"url":null,"title":"four statues people want removed","story":"NewsFour other statues people want removed after slave trader Edward ColstonThe toppling of a statue of th century slave owner Edward Colston in Bristol yesterday has sparked calls for other monuments with links to Britains colonial past to be removedShareCommentsByTaz AliAnna MacSwan:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsA statue of Edward Colston was pulled down by anti-racist protesters yesterday \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The statue had been up for  years but had faced calls for its removal for years now.Bristolaposs then mayor George Ferguson branded celebrations of Colston perverse in . Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the protests, which took place nationwide, as having been subverted by thuggery after  police officers were injured on Saturday and Sunday in London. However, taking inspiration from yesterdayaposs events, a number of petitions are now calling for other memorials to be taken down.Henry DundasEdinburgh residents are calling for a statue of slave owner Henry Dundas to be pulled down and dumped into the Firth of Forth. One of Scotlandaposs most influential politicians, the former Home Secretary is widely considered to be responsible for delaying the abolition of slavery in .

More than , people have now signed a petition calling for its removal and for streets bearing his name to be renamed. Petition organiser and local resident Nancy Barrett, , said: I feel as though Scotlandaposs involvement in the slave trade has been silently swept under the rug and a lot of people think Scotland is innocent, which isnapost the case. The height of the statue alone shows how highly Henry Dundas was thought of when it was erected. If it were to be removed it would denounce the glorication of him, and force people to learn about who he really was. The longer it stays up, the longer Scotland is denying its past by refusing to amend something that should have happened years ago. Sir Thomas Picton A marble statue of Sir Thomas Picton has stood in Cardf City Hall since , and is part of a series of memorials depicting Heroes of Wales. The cityaposs first black Lord Mayor Dan DeaposAth is now among those calling for its removal due to his links to the slave trade in the th century. Picton is accused of having a dozen slaves executed while governor of Trinidad during colonial rule, and is said to have used the slave trade to partially build up his considerable fortune.  In , nine years before he became the highest-ranking officer killed at the Battle of Waterloo, he was found guilty of torturing a -year-old mixed-race girl during his rule of the Caribbean island. The girl, Louisa Calderon, was tortured in an attempt to get her to confess to stealing from a businessman she lived with as a mistress, and was suspended with rope by one arm above a spike in the floor. He was never sentenced, and two years later the verdict was reversed at a retrial. In a letter to the leader of Cardf Council, Mr DeaposAth wrote: I feel that it is no longer acceptable for Pictonaposs statue to be amongst the aposHeroes of Walesapos in City Hall, and I am calling on you to arrange for its removal from the Marble Hall at a time when resources and logistics allow and when it is safe to do so. Robert Clive More than , people have signed two petitions calling for a statue of Robert Clive - known as Clive of India - to be taken down from the Square in Shrewsbury. The former town MP was the first British Governor of Bengal, and played a key role in establishing British colonial rule in India. David Parton, who started one of the petitions, says the monument illustrates how embedded racism is in the UK. Clive played a central role in seizing control of a large swathe of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Males, Myanmar, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and other parts of Southeast Asia, he wrote. He was responsible for looting the wealth and resources of those places, and established colonial control by force over millions of people, as a leading agent of the East India Company . “This statue commemorates Clive, and by so doing embodies the racist and inhumane nature of his actions. “If we are not comfortable with a statue of Joseph Stalin or Genghis Khan, how can we be comfortable with a statue of Clive ” Cecil Rhodes  Yesterdayaposs events have renewed calls for a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes to be taken down from the University of Oxford. Campaigners previously attempted to have the statue removed in , when Oriel College said it served as a reminder of the complexity of history and of the legacies of colonialism. The th century businessman was Prime Minister of the Cape Colony in southern Africa from  to . The Rhodes Must Fall movement was established in  at Cape Town University, and later spread to Oxford. Protesters are now planning a protest in front of the figure in Oxford High Street tomorrow.

Breweries are getting ready to deliver  million pints next week and landlords are rolling up sleeves to get their outdoor spaces ready. And with football back on TV on June , some drinkers will be able to sup in the summer sunshine and watch theof the Premier League on outdoor screens.A group of ministers dubbed the “Save Summer Six” and led by Chancellor Rishi Sunak are pushing for the July  opening to be brought forward amid fears of mass job lossesthe sector misses out on the lucrative summer season.Peter Borg-Neal, of Oakman Inns, has been campaigning for beer gardens to reopen and said they were a safer environment than impromptu picnics in parks. The group, which has  pubs across the South East, has been preparing for weeks and has marked out social-distancing spaces, set up hand-sanitiser stations, bought PPE gear and set up a one-way system to toilets. Mr Borg-Neal said: “This is long overdue and many pubs already doing takeaways will be ready for the next step, which is for beer gardens to open. “We are very excited to think we will be welcoming back customers and saving jobs, too.” The chain has , employees and while not all will get back to work, there is a ripple of hope running through the industry. With forecasts predicting a warm start to the week of June , some pub owners are thinking of putting up large outdoor screens so fans can enjoy beer and football.  Mr Borg-Neal said: “Sports pubs, in particular, will be a draw with outdoor screens.” Rick and Lysa Robinson, who manage the Willoughby Arms, in Kingston-upon-Thames, West London, also welcomed news gardens could get the go-ahead. Mr Robinson, , who has run the pub for  years, said: “It’s a step in the right direction and its welcome – even though we will be operating at a loss.” His pub garden already has a in outdoor TV and is likely to pull in the punters.

Experts say holidaymakers are in for a bargain bonanza once lockdown restrictions are eased as airlines and tour operators will be keen to fill seats and hotels. With red-hot deals already up for grabs in July and August, as the Government looks into setting up air bridges to popular destinations, hopes of a summer break in the sun have been revived again. Travel consultant Paul Charles said: “Airlines will be looking to pump-prime the market, which will result in a flood of cheap seats as they try to persuade people to fly again.”Budget airlines have already sparked a price war. Ryanair is offering up to % off flights, and EasyJet has offers such as £. for a trip to Crete, once its fleet is flying again next week.Travel operators like package holiday giant TUI are offering huge discounts on summer trips. Ryanair says bookings for July and August have surged by % amid growing hopes that we will get the all-clear for holidays abroad. While the Government has imposed a -day quarantine for most passengers entering the UK from this week, travel industry insiders are said to be banking on a U-turn shortly. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is working with Spain, Greece and Portugal to create air corridors, which would allow people to travel between those nations without quarantining.  Travel industry body ABTA says it is expecting a last-minute rush once travel restrictions are eased. An ABTA spokesman said: “As people become more confident in booking a holiday, the travel industry is sure to respond with competitive prices, offers and flexible terms. “There is massive pent-up demand for holidays, which are an essential part of le for many, so to manage people’s expectations it would be helpfulthe Government could clearly communicate a co-ordinated roadmap for exiting lockdown so we can get travelling safely again.”  Kelly Cooke, of travel group Advantage Travel Partnership, said: “We are all desperate to stimulate the market when the Foreign Office ban and quarantine is lted. That, coupled with the fact that the airport experience will be more challenging, means pricing may need to be more attractive.” Jetholidays announced last night that it is delaying resuming flights and holidays by two weeks, from July  to July .  The airline and tour operator said customers who had been due to travel before July  will be able to re-book for a later date, get a credit note or request a full refund. The firm said: “In view of the ongoing travel restrictions, we have taken the decision to recommence our flights and holidays on July . The health and safety of our customers and colleagues is our absolute priority.” "},{"url":null,"title":"set life results live winning","story":"NewsSet For Le results LIVE: Winning lottery numbers for Monday June A le-changing £,-per-month prize for the next  years is the top prize in tonights draw.

Towns and high streets were already struggling before the pandemic so now it is even more vital to support them, which is why we’ve launched our Shop For Britain campaign. But with fears about how retailers can observe social distancing guidelines, we went to find out what the new normal looks like for three major retailers in the empty heart of London. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Marks  Spencer On walking into Marks and Spencer on Oxford Street, the most striking thing is how spacious it is - and not just because I’m the only one in here. There’s a hand sanitising station by the entrance and it’s not just any hand sanitiser - this is MS hand sanitiser. It smells ine. Once cleansed, I grab a metal basket - they have switched them from plastic to make cleaning easier - and start browsing. A number of rails and displays have been removed to make it easier to social distance and I can see all the way to the back of the shop. For now in this store, only the first floor and the food hall is open but on June  it will be the entire shop. And no one will ever forget about social distancing with the amount of signage on the shop floor. A polkadot dress catches my eye - MS has no rule in place to stop shoppers from touching the items - but sadly I can’t try it on in the fitting rooms.  Services such as fittings for bras, suits and kids shoes are all temporarily closed, but the retailer has enhanced its bra fit tool online and staff are on hand to give advice. For any s, for which customers have  days, the items will be quarantined until it’s safe to put them back on the shop floor. Cleanliness is the top priority - staff wash their hands every  minutes and sanitise after serving each customer. The tills are spaced out with plenty of room for customers to queue up while staying two metres apart. Stacey the cashier beams as she says, “Hello, would you like some hand sanitiser ” She sanitises her hands too and then asksI’m comfortable with her touching the dress I want to buy. I am, butcustomers don’t want staff to handle their goods they can remove hangers themselves and put them in a box on their side of the till.  It’s possible to complete the transaction without staff touching anything you want to buy. MS is also encouraging customers to use contactless payment - and the limit has been increased to £ - but cash is allowedthat’s not possible. If you fancy a coffee after a browse, some cafes are open for takeaway drinks but you can’t sit in at the moment. All in all, it’s a very pleasurable shopping experience. O The mobile phone retailer has a slick operation in place ahead of opening next week. At The Strand store only three customers can be inside at once but others don’t wait outside. Instead, O has a ‘virtual’ queuing system, meaning customers can browse where until they’re notied via text it’s their turn. As I am having a sneak preview, I am welcomed in straight away by a member of staff who muffles a greeting beneath her PPE mask and visor. I can’t hear a word she’s saying, but appreciate the stringent measures O has put in place. Again, I am asked to sanitise my hands. Handset models are still on display so I can touch the screen to get a feel for the product, but staff assure me they will wipe down handsets after each use. I’m then invited to take a seat on a chair, which has been marked out by yellow and black tape exactly two metres away from the saleswoman. Her desk is protected by a perspex screen and she’s wearing a visor for extra precaution. Signage is also prominent, with one even advising on what to dothey cough or sneeze in store. O’s sales director Gareth Turpin says the Mirror’s campaign is just what the country needs. He said: “I think it’s a great idea. The high street is the leblood of lots of communities. A flourishing town tends to have a strong High Street, whether that stores, restaurants, bars, places in the community that people like to mix in to get out there and be served face to face. “I’ve been in some of our stores since we started refitting them. Although the streets have been quiet, there have been people coming up and asking when we will reopen. They want to know when they can come in. “There’s a real demand out there for people to get back on the high street, come into stores and have face to face interaction.” The brand has more than  stores across the UK. And planning in each of them has been a meticulous process as the chain adapts to the new rules. Gareth said: “We’ve got  processes we use in our stores ranging from our customer comes into the store through the front door, right to how a delivery comes into the store through the back door and everything in between. We’ve remodelled or made a change to  of those process as well so everything from layout to customer interactions is taken care of. “There’s new signage. There are plastic screens up and in terms of PPE our staff have masks when they are doing back office work. We have gloves and plastic visors for when they actually serve a customer.” And NHS and care workers will be given VIP access to skip the queue to speak to an advisor in store. Gareth is confident his team will be ready for the reopening on June . And although business might be slow at first he wants customers to know everything is waiting for them. He added: “Everybody is dferent and they will come back to the high street when they’re ready. “Our message is very much that we’re there to serve you. We work really hard and our teams have worked exceptionally hard. And I’m really proud of what they’ve done to create an environment that is safe for them and for our customers.” Boots Liverpool Street is normally one of the busiest stations in London but despite that, the social distancing measures at this Boots are thorough. I normally find Boots a bit claustrophobic, especially the smaller branches in big stations, but I was pleasantly surprised by this store. The retailer has removed a number of shelves and units to space things out, making it feel a lot bigger.  The biggest change is the make-up counters, where testers have all been removed and beauticians can’t give makeovers or tutorials at the moment. So what happensyou need to buy a product but have no idea what to purchase  It’s actually enhanced the need for excellent customer service and expertise. When I ask for a new mascara after being in lockdown for so long, it’s genuinely lovely to chat about make-up and not coronavirus.

During a Black Lives Matter protest on Sunday a large crowd of people gathered around the statue of Edward Colston, a notorious slave trader. Using ropes the demonstrators pulled Colston down and rolled him into the water, to great cheers from onlookers, Bristol Post reported. Speaking live on BBC Radio Bristol, Mayor Marvin Rees warned about the dangers of mass gatherings. While he said he did not support criminal damage, Mayor Rees argued the toppling of the statue was now part of the cityaposs history. Itaposs still underwater, at some point it will be fished out... we will obviously take the statue out, he said. But we have a number of priorities in the city at the moment not least trying to face up to an £million gap in our budget that we have been left with by national Government not funding us adequately for covid. Whataposs happened to the statue is now part of that statueaposs story. People in Bristol came together and said we donapost want that statue in the middle of the city. What I would also recognise though-  and itaposs important to do so - is that many people are dismayed by the tearing down of the statue and as a city it is our job to unite those voices to. We do live in a country where some people feel like they are losing their grip on their history and identity, many people believe Colston represented their sense of Bristol. So we as a city need to now have that kind of discussion with ourselves about what we are as a city and how we all make sure we have a sense of place and ownership. He added: It is highly likely that the Colston statue will end up in one of our museums.  For many years before the statue was taken off its plinth yesterday campaigners in Bristol and further afield have been calling for it to be removed. Colston was a member of the Royal African Company, which transported about , men, women and children from Africa to the Americas. On his death in , he bequeathed his wealth to charities and his legacy can still be seen on Bristolaposs streets, memorials and buildings.  Avon and Somerset Police said a decision was taken not to intervene when it became clear the statue was coming down. In the day since a petition has been launched to have a statue of Paul Stephenson stand on the now empty plinth. The local hero led the  Bristol Bus Boycott, started because the Bristol Post announced in  that black workers were refused work, despite a shortage of employees.

The inclement spell came after the driest May on record brought days of warm sunshine as Brits were kept indoors during lockdown. WxCHARTS shows warmer weather is expected to arrive from mainland Europe next weekend as it shts westwards. Thermometers are expected to tip towards C in London this weekend and C by Tuesday next week, while beachgoers could enjoy highs of C in Brighton next Saturday.  The Met Office said: The first few days of the period, including next weekend and into the start of the following week, should see the driest brightest weather across northern areas of the UK, particularly western Scotland.Elsewhere, conditions will be rather changeable with some sunshine but also areas of rain or showers. Many parts will become warm, perhaps very warm, particularly northwestern areas. The Met Office said temperatures are more likely to be warmer in the south than the north of the country from the middle of the month. They said: From the middle of June, there should be ato more settled conditions with longer drier and brighter spells.  This period should be generally drier than average, though there is still the possibility of some more changeable spells, these becoming more focused across northwestern areas later in the month. Temperatures are more likely to be above average in the south, but nearer normal further north. Today Most areas dry with a mixture of cloud and some bright or sunny spells, best of the sunshine probably over southwestern UK. Early cloud and rain over the Hebrides, meanwhile, spreads into western Scotland and Northern Ireland later.

Until Prince Andrew answers detailed questions about the sex offender, his name will forever be dragged through the mud and there is zero prospect of ato public le. When the tales from a young woman who claims Epstein made her have sex with the Prince – which the Prince denies – are so disturbing you’d think he would be hammering on the FBI’s door to clear his name. So let’s end this war of words between the US Ministry of Justice and the Prince. Andrew’s lawyers insist he’s made three offers to help. Well let’s see a no-strings fourth and arrange for an interview in London. We criticise the US for shielding Anne Sacoolas, wanted in the UK over Harry Dunn’s death. The Duke must lead by example, and co-operate fully. Virus farce Quarantine is another failed policy. Forcing those arriving at airports to shut themselves away for two weeks is a blunt instrument riddled with holes. To work, this strategy should have been applied at the start of the pandemic, not now. It also makes no sense to impose this on people from countries with much lower coronavirus rates than our own.  And thirdly, allowing use of public transport, accommodation changes and shopping trips are holes big enough to fly a jumbo jet through. Mixed messages explain why public disapproval over the Government’s handling of the crisis is the highest in Europe.

Queueing for hours outside the Fountain of Praise church in Houston, Texas, many sang Lean on Me as they waited and some wore T-shirts and face masks with the words I Canapost Breathe. Filing through the church in two parallel lines, some people bowed their heads, others made the sign of the cross or raised a fist, as they reached Mr Floyd’s open casket. Many broke down in floods of tears. Mr Floyd lay wearing a brown suit in a gold-coloured coffin. Fire officials said several people, apparently overcome by temperatures up to C while waiting in line, were taken to local hospitals. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, meanwhile, led House and Senate Democrats in a moment of silence after reading the names of those killed in police custody. She said the martyrdom of George Floyd had made a change in the world, and referred to other black Americans as martyrs after they died at the hands of police brutality. They then kneeled for  minutes and  seconds - theof time prosecutors say Mr Floyd was pinned under a white police officer’s knee before he died on May . The shocking incident triggered two weeks of protests in US cities, deepening a political crisis for President Donald Trump, who repeatedly threatened to order active duty troops onto the streets to put an end to bursts of looting and vandalism.All four officers involved at the scene of Mr Floydaposs death have since been fired and charged - including veteran ex-cop Derek Chauvin, who faces  years in prisonfound guilty of second degree murder. A bystander’s phone captured the moments as Mr Floyd pleaded with Chauvin in Minneapolis, choking out the words, I can’t breathe. Pressure has mounted in Congress and across the United States for sweeping reforms to the justice system in light of the father-of-threeaposs death. Demonstrators’ anger is giving way to a growing determination to make his case a turning point in race relations and a lightning rod for change in the way police departmentsacross the country.  On Monday, Democrats in Congress unveiled legislation that would make lynching a hate crime and allow victims of misconduct and their families to sue police for damages in civil court, ending a legal doctrine known as qualied immunity. Their -page bill also would ban chokeholds and require the use of body cameras by federal law enforcement officers, restrict the use of lethal force, and facilitate independent probes of police departments that show patterns of misconduct. It does not call for the funding of police departments to be cut or abolished, as some protesters and activists have sought.But lawmakers called for spending priorities to change.  “We have confused having safe communities with hiring more cops on the street...when in fact the real way to achieve safe and healthy communities is to invest in these communities,” Senator Kamala Harris, seen as a potential running-mate to Biden, said at a briefing. Trump, who has portrayed himself as a defender of law and order during the protests, “is appalled by the defund-the-police movement,” White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told a media briefing.She said Trump was weighing ious proposals in response to Floyd’s death. Biden does not support the movement to defund police departments as a response to police brutality, but is in favor of the “urgent need” for reform, a spokesman for his presidential campaign said on Monday.  Democrats vowed to bring the legislation in coming weeks to the floor of the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.

Up to a quarter of UK adults are consuming more alcohol as a result of the Covid- crisis, according to a poll by the charity Action on Addiction and YouGov. Nearly one in four with a history of addiction has reported a recurrence of their addictive behaviour or have recently relapsed while in recovery. The shocking statistics also show an increase in addictive behaviour from children as young as . In her role as patron of the charity, Kate made a virtual visit to the Clouds House rehab centre in Wiltshire via a video call from the Cambridges’ family home, Anmer Hall in Norfolk.  The Duchess, who has been involved with the organisation since , talked to staff about how they have adapted their services, taking them online due to the coronavirus crisis as well as discussing fears that more people will need treatment as the Covid- lockdown eases.She said: “The worrying thing is, it is all those people who aren’t necessarily reaching out who are struggling, who perhaps don’t feel they can reach out. “Or the fact that maybe they haven’t realised that addictive behaviours have sort of established, particularlyit’s the first time - and it’s those people who aren’t necessarily being vocal about it, it’s making sure that they know they can reach out and that you are there to help and support them in this very dficult time.”  Kate made her first visit to the Wiltshire centre in  and has since visited the charity’s bases in Essex, London, Liverpool, and Stockton-on-Tees. The charity yesterday published research titled National Poll on Addiction Behaviours in Lockdown, sampling , Brits to examine changes to lestyles under the Covid- outbreak. One in four said they are drinking since lockdown started - resulting in nearly .million people across the country. From the sample, % of those adults - or up to .million people - said as a result of drinking more they are experiencing problems such as relationship dficulties, managing work, sleeping problems or added debt. The findings also suggest % have increased the amount of online gambling they are doing - amounting to two million people throughout the country. Worryingly for the charity, % of all those surveyed said they think they would find it dficult to access support or treatment were they to need. During her virtual visit last week Kate spoke to CEO Graham Beech, clinical lead Dr Simone Yule and treatment manager Anya Sparks, Kate, , asked what challenges they had been forced to overcome during the pandemic. Dr Yule said: “We are seeing more alcohol issues and in the community. “I think definitely we know alcohol sales have gone up exponentially, so the rise in people that are now starting to seek treatment with lockdown gradually lting, I think that is going to have a big impact.” Mr Beech added: “We are getting enquiries and phone calls from people who are not sure where to go and are not sure that treatment is available. “We have discovered that people are struggling during lockdown. “More people are drinking and gambling but also we are concerned about the number of people who are struggling to maintain their recovery and are getting into relapse. “We are particularly concerned about families and young people and the impact that lockdown and addiction is having.” "},{"url":null,"title":"best day year born can","story":"NewsBest day of the year to be born - and why it can make a huge dference to your leOcean Finance has discovered which month of the year - and the exact date - offers the highest chances of successShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  JUN NewsWho knew that when you were born could impact how successful you are in the future  \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The study found that most of the UKaposs top achievers were born in September. This may be because they started school as some of the oldest in their year, compared to the August children who are always much younger on their first day. The  month gap can have a huge dference in both physical and intellectual development. Research also found that September  happens to be the most common birthday for those successful Brits surveyed. Those born in February and November are considered to succeed the least, with just six per cent of the most successful people have birthdays in these months.

The short clip was filmed on a tour of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, when visitors must not have believed their luck when the van was able to get within inches of two lions. With the big cats seemingly happy to mind their own business as people inside the vehicle capture the moment on cameras, footage shows one man sitting within touching distance of the lions with the window wide open. The temptation proves to be too much for one fellow passenger, who then leans across him to reach out of the window and stroke the lionaposs back. At first, the male lion doesnapost seem to react as the man sitting closest pulls out his camera for another snap, but the mood quickly changes as the lion slowly turns its head to growl. Panicked voices can be heard telling him to close the window as he nervously reaches to slide it back across. Before he can, the intimidating lion roars angrily into the vehicle as he abandons his attempts and the camera ducks down behind one of the seats.  The lion is then shown to be on its feet staring at the tourists as the man scrambles to shut the flimsy window for protection.It was shared on YouTube by Maasai Sightings with the title aposStill the dumbest tourist ever apos and the description reads: A tourist in Serengeti decided to touch a male lion and almost got her face ripped off. This is a very dumb thing to do and you can easily get yourself killed or banned from a national park by doing this."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.43922202-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.43922202-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.43922202-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.43922202-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"around 10000 jobs to be slashed by oil industry giant bp according to reports","story":"Oil industry giant BP is planning to cut around , jobs from its workforce, it has been reported.It is understood chief executive Bernard Looney informed employees that % of the workforce would be cut in response to the Covid- outbreak and resulting downturn in the oil industry.Most of the cuts – totalling around , workers – are expected to be made by the end of the year, Energy Voice reports.BP currently employs , people worldwide.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

concept of ldquomy space as they move forward.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status it gave the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in their planned revised frameworkwhich is under reviewThe map is part of a wide-ranging consultation which will be launched on the councilrsquos consultation hub on Monday and tackles everything from the environment to travel, leisure and geothermic and renewable energy.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells to look at the latest technology and reducing the town and surrounding areas carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater from the area to create waterways and how they can be used to create geothermic energy projects.Project leader Douglas Proudfoot said the idea behind the new water features across the area was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent. The firrst houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.ldquoI also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido, space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar development in modular manufacture and construction.The council is launching an eight-week consultation on their vision for the area from tomorrow and people will be able to go in and give their views.They are also hoping that as lockdown restrictions ease they may be able to have outdoor exhibitions for people who cannot access the proposals online and will be advertising the consultation locally so people can get in touch through the post.The Scottish Government is currently looking at revising its framework and the council has made its case for the wider area to be classed as a National Development, which will give their proposals support at a national level.The consultation will open at https:eastlothianconsultations  from Monday, June ."},{"url":null,"title":"ball-outdoor-sports-return-garden-centres-re-open","story":"It was paradise for county golfers as they were able toto the greens after two months of inactivity.Some county bowling clubs also reopened, while beaches were busy during one of the hottest days of the year, despite East Lothian Council keeping coastal car parks closed.The majority of East Lothianrsquos -plus bowls clubs have reopened.The clubs still closed ndash including East Linton, Tranent, Elphinstone, North Berwick and Prestongrange ndash have indicated they are looking to open when the Scottish Government moves into phase two of its plan.

plan to offer parents three admission dates ndash August, January and Easter ndash and get rid of the October start.In a recommendation which was approved by East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency covid response group, they agreed to abolish the October admission date and allow children who turn three in September to start in August.In her report, Ms Brown said a public consultation on the changes drew  responses.She said nearly half of parents who responded and had children who turn three in August were in favour of the change.However she added: ldquoMost parents carers of children who will be three years of age between September   and October ,  were not in favour of this change.Despite this she said the change would bring East Lothian into line with Scottish Government guidance and the practices across Scotland.She said: ldquoIn moving from a four-term to a three-term entry we will continue to support early entry for children with particular needs or those considered as vulnerable, as is the case now, to ensure no educational disadvantage.Meanwhile the education chief revealed that som nurseries in East Lothian will be able to offer the new , hours of childcare which had been anticipated before lockdown to families from August.The Scottish Government has suspended its deadline for all nurseries to offer the extended free hours as a result of the coronavirus crisis.However Ms Brown has revealed some facilities will be pushing ahead with the plans.She said: ldquoAs it stands, we are planning that from August , those nursery classes that are already offering , hours as part of the trials will continue to do so.She went on to say the council does not expect to introduce any new nursery settings of its own in August but anticipates that three private nurseries which currently offer  hours will introduce , hours in that month.The decision toscrap the October admission was approved by councillors Shamin Akhtar, Norman Hampshire, Jane Henderson and Stuart

local authority with a series of images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining and agricultural heritage and the site of the Battle of Prestonpans.The council launched its eightweek consultation on its online hub on Monday.The Scottish Government is revising its National Development Planning Framework which gives an overview of what it wants to see develop on key sites across Scotland.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe are grateful for the many views and ideas received in response to early engagement on National Planning Framework  .Our analysis of the responses is underway and will continue over the summer, and we expect to publish an

They are a giant of nature, yet also incredibly intelligent. They feel emotion like we do, in fact possibly more so as the emotional part of their brain is even more developed than that of humans.The old saying that ldquoan elephant never forgets is rooted in this fact. An elephantrsquos emotional intelligence comes from its ability to remember and recall distant memory. Like humans, an elephantrsquos way of being is mostly learned in early le, rather than just based on instinct.They are therefore highly sensitive creatures, influenced and affected by what they experience just as we are.Irsquove heard dferent versions of this tale, and here I have peppered it very slightly with my own style:Once, a king in ancient India owned an elephant. This royal elephant was the joy not just of the king, but also his people.The trainer would ride the elephant every day along the streets. She was a magnicent sight, and children would run out to wave and watch the elephant go by. The trainer took a dferent route each day so people in dferent neighbourhoods all had a chance to enjoy the spectacle.The people felt a real love and affinity for the elephant. Despite her size and strength, she was gentle and affectionate with the people. She would pat children carefully on their heads with her trunk and took care in where she walked.The elephant made people feel safe. More than once she had saved a child from drowning in the nearby river, or from a predator from the jungle. She was a sacred animal to the people.But then people began to notice a change in the elephantrsquos behaviour. She became aggressive and unpredictable. Instead of being patient with the children she knocked them out of her way with her trunk. Instead of being careful where she walked, she deliberately trampled on peoplersquos gardens.The trainer tried his best to control the elephant, but she seemed like a dferent animal. He couldnrsquot understand why she was behaving so dferently.It just got worse, until one day the elephant suddenly set off on a charge and rampaged through the streets, trumpeting loudly as she charged at the terried people, almost killing some of them.The king was horried and ordered the elephant to be confined to her stables. With dficulty she was finally brought under control and locked in.ldquoWhat is going on  asked the king to the trainer.ldquoI have no idea your majesty he replied, ldquoitrsquos asshe is a dferent elephant.ldquoPerhaps the elephant is ill in some way  suggested one of the kingrsquos advisors. But the vet found nothing physically wrong.Then the trainer suggested asking an old man who lived in the jungle as ldquohe is known for his wisdom in understanding animals, perhaps he will know what the cause of this is.So the king sent a messenger and the old man came to the royal palace.ldquoCan you help  asked the king.The old man asked to be left alone with the elephant for a while.When he ed he looked at the king and said: ldquoWhatever is wrong is something that cannot be seen. I must spend some time with the elephant to understand what is troubling her.And so the old man decided to watch over the elephant that night. He smeared himself in mud to mask his scent and hid in a corner of the stable.It was late evening when he heard voices.A group of men had entered the stables from a small side door. They were a gang of murderers. They were using the royal elephant stable as a place to meet and plan their activities. And in so doing they recounted stories of their deeds.Their leader was a man with a cold and ruthless heart. He told stories about his le and deeds, of how hersquod murdered and tortured people he didnrsquot like. Members of his gang laughed and shared their tales too, likewise full of hatred and cruelty.The elephant slumbered as these tales were told, but they were unknowingly heard by her. When the elephant woke the following morning, the tales of hate and violence still swirled in her mind.The old man went to the king.ldquoYour majesty, there are two things you must do to cure the elephant.ldquoThe first is to remove the murderers who meet in the stables at night. The second is you must find the kindest people, who live their lives with love and understanding. Then ask them to meet at night in the stable as the elephant sleeps and tell each other stories from their lives tales of love and understanding. If you do this, then the elephant will be cured.The king looked bemused.ldquoI will most certainly remove the murderers, he said, ldquobut are you saying that stories will cure the elephant ldquoYes, your majesty, replied the old man, ldquobut the right stories. You see we are made from the stories we hear.He went on: ldquoIf we constantly hear tales of hatred and violence then those stories paint our vision of le with fear, loathing and cruelty.ldquoButwe mostly hear tales of love and understanding, then our mind is coloured with kindness for others, and for ourselves.ldquoWe are affected by the stories we hear, evenwe donrsquot realise we have been listening to them.ldquoYour elephant was unknowingly listening to tales of hatred and killing every night as she slept. So her mind was filled with hate and distrust her vision of the world changed and so did her behaviour.ldquoIf she hears good stories then she will eventually become her kind self again.The king nodded in understanding and agreed to act on this. Within a few weeks the elephantrsquos behaviour had changed for the better.ldquoYou are indeed wise in the ways of elephants, the king said to the old man.ldquoThe truth in this is not just for elephants, the old man replied.ldquoPeople are like your elephant the stories they hear will paint their world and affect how they live in it.The king nodded once again.ldquoMy job is done, said the old man, ldquoI will nowto the forest.ldquoBy the way, your elephant will have a calf, and her calf must hear good stories too.ldquoHow can I pay you for your wisdom  asked the king.The old man thought for a moment, then said: ldquoBe a king who tells good stories tales of kindness and understanding. And be a good listener to the stories told by your people.ldquoThen you will be a truly great leader and your kingdom will flourish and be a happier place.ldquoIf you do that, it will be my greatest reward."},{"url":null,"title":"strawberry-moon-2020-time-see-skies-uk","story":"The Strawberry Moon coincideswith summer solstice once every  years when the moon is situated on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun - whichfully illuminates its round shape.Unfortunately, despite its fruity name, the moon may notappear in warm colours as we would expect.The lunar event got its name fromNative American tribes, who used the moon to help them indicate when fruit would be ripened.What does NASA say about the Strawberry Moon As described by NASA: ldquoThe Maine Farmers Almanac first published Indian names for the full moons in the s.ldquoAccording to this almanac, the full moon in June or the last full Moon of spring is known as the Strawberry Moon, a name universal to just about every Algonquin tribe.ldquoThe name comes from the relatively short season for harvesting strawberries in northeastern North America.The Strawberry Moon has also been referred to as the Hot Moon.So, when can I see it You can expect to see the spectacular lunar event at about .pm BST tonight .According to the Royal Greenwich Observatory in London, the Strawberry Moon will last for up to three orfour days."},{"url":null,"title":"black-lives-matter-donate-help-get-diverse-books-primary-schools","story":"The fund -which has raised over pound, since it was created on Wednesday, June  - aims to help black, Asian and minority ethnicstudents to feel represented by their school libraries.The initiative was inspired by protests that have taken place across the world calling for justice after the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May .Who created the fund Scott Emmons, who created the fund, told the PA news agency:ldquoTherersquos a lack of books in primary schools where not only can teachers teach the white students about these issues, but also the BAME students are severely under-represented in the books that they have.\"Mr Emmons, , who lives in Wanstead, added: ldquoI went to the protest on Wednesday in Hyde Park and came away feeling so energised.

The First Minister has taken control of the management of the pandemic in Scotland. She has stated on many occasions that she takes the decisions and the responsibility and she has fronted every daily press conference, a feat of stamina and leadership that is admirable in itself. Butthe ldquoelite has failed, so has the First Minister.Its not aswe were not warned. There were at least four reports, three specically for the Scottish Government, that told of lack or equipment and processes to handle a pandemic, but it appears that the warnings were ignored, and the necessary preparations were never made. It is also obvious that the UK did not lock down quickly enough, but the first signicant outbreak was in Edinburgh and it was covered up by the First Minister. Had it been known to the public, pressure for an earlier lockdown would have been likely. Instead concerts and sporting events were allowed to continue, including the Scotland-France rugby on March . The Old Firm game of March  was cancelled by the SPFL, not the Scottish Government. BBC Scotlands Disclosure programme calculated that a two-week delay could have cost , Scottish lives over the following month.The lack of preparedness and delayed lockdown affected the UK and the devolved administrations in equal measure, resulting in lack of PPE, hospital beds, ventilators and other necessary equipment. The urging of the WHO to ldquotest, test, test was ignored in Scotland as much as England, and current testing levels are lower in Scotland. Infections are at the same rate in Scotland. The death rate from the virus is the same. Excess deaths are the same. Deaths in care homes are slightly worseanything. Discharging potentially infected people, and therefore the virus, from hospitals into care homes is the same. There is the same callousness in refusing to move the elderly sick from care homes to hospital. The result in all of the UK has been more infections and extra deaths.A good comparator of success or failure is New Zealand, with the same population as Scotland but with  deaths compared to our ,. It is dficult to see how such breath-taking levels of incompetence bolster any case for ldquoindependence except with those obsessed with it in the first place. Andthe failure of an ldquoelite is the cause, as Mr McKenna suggests, then the Tory elite in Westminster and the SNP elite in Holyrood would seem to be more or less equally culpable.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.READING Kevin McKennas column on Saturday made me wonder: able writer for your paper that he is, does he ever read your paper Your front-page lead story in the very same editionhad already demolished his assertions. Tom Gordonrsquos compelling exposures showed that the Scottish Governmentrsquos suppression of information Scottish people are entitled to know, as well as the damaging untruths we had been fed, are a cause for great concern.The fact that an incompetent elite in charge of the Covid- virus in London is leading to lack of trust, hardly confirms that similar ldquoelites are not mishandling the crisis where.Your revelation that the Scottish Government shared the Iris Report in February  with the UK Governmentshowed that both Tory and SNP Governments are jointly culpable of a disastrous lack of preparations for a pandemic that was predictable and predicted. You rightly report the view that ldquoalarm bells were ringing for both the Scottish and UK governments. Surely objective readers have concluded that both administrations failed catastrophically, resulting in a huge number of lives being lost.Elsewhere in the same edition the impact on Scottish education was exposed in David Bolrsquos coruscating article headed ldquoPupils have been left severely traumatised\". Again an indication that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos handling of these matters is no better than Boris Johnsonrsquos.Moreover, Saturdayrsquos Herald was not a one-off. Switching scores of frail elderly patients from hospitals into care homes, without their or their familiesrsquo agreement, is surely beyond defending far less a case for independence.The consequences of the Nike Conference in Edinburgh and the cover-up which followed will not go away.Boris Johnsonrsquos appalling handling of the Dominic Cummings affair remains without justication. But anyone who followed Ms Sturgeonrsquos attempts, for a whole day, to seek to retain her hapless adviser, until her own career was clearly in jeopardy, will hardly be convinced that the First Ministerrsquos motivation was at all laudable.Mr McKennarsquos repeated description of the many who disagree with separatism as ldquoUnionists is offensive to those who understand its connotations. The clear majority of Scots ndash amounting to an almost  per cent majority ndash to reject the ldquoonce in a letime choice should not have their views distorted. We choose to love our country, Scotland, and to work with others in the United Kingdom to achieve a better society and continue to hold to account an ldquoelite ldquowhether it exists in Holyrood or Westminster.Lest I am thought to be over-critical of Kevin McKenna, I welcomed his recollection that a Labour leader, Clement Attlee saved Britain, including Scotland, from the horrors of fascism by rejecting Lord Halax. I imagine Sir Starmer would agree wholly with that,not the rest of the article.Tom Clarke, Coatbridge.TOM Gordonrsquos exposeacute lays bare the damage being done to the relationship between the people of Scotland and those who govern us.His revelation that almost , patients have acquired Covid- and more than  have died after being admitted to hospital for other conditions is deplorable. But the attempt by Jeane Freeman, the Health Secretary, to appear to camouflage this and to speak instead of  ldquoincidents of Covid- on other wards is despicable.AC Grayling has previously written that ldquoin the related arts of politics and government, judicious economies with truth are a stock in trade, and the learned philosopher may well be right, but onlywe let them get away with it.When dealing with the impact of this pandemic, we need our leaders to tell us in plain language exactly how it is, no matter how bad. If they do not, and others have to speak truth to power, then our government has failed us.Bob Scott, Drymen.AN active No campaigner in  I now find myself unable to bear the thought of being subjected to a future of relentless mis-governance by such second-rate politicians as make up the current Westminster Cabinet.On the other hand, my principal concern about independence has always been the impact of the inevitable financial turmoil on those in poverty and otherwise deprived and powerless after a decade of Conservative austerity. The Yes SNP Green coalition has been unwilling to acknowledge, far less address, that issue.And so I believe that the Government and people of Scotland must find a way of addressing the issue of how we can deal with the consequences of being part of the Dystopian DysUnited Kingdomwith its architectsrsquo rejection of the UK values its citizens once believed were at least implied in its unwritten constitution.I find myself thinking that a resounding vote for an SNP Green alliance next year with a correspondingly overwhelming rejection of Jackson Carlawrsquos Conservatives would be the only way to put the necessary shot over the bows of the DDUK. A risky strategy for a non-nationalist  Probably, but presently I see no alternative when faced with a Government determined to create an ldquoindependent England founded on closer ties with a Trumpian United States.John Milne, Uddingston.THE political consequences of Brexit have so far been more rapid and lethal than its economic damage, leaving Britain with a Gilbert-and-Sullivan style leadership of spectacular incompetence during one of the worst public health crises in recent history.Out of , excess deaths, , could have been avoided had we acted like any other European and East Asian nation. On a single day last week,  people died from coronavirus in the UK ndash more than in all  EU countries over the same  hours.North and south of the Border, as government failures multiply, the default position is evasion and denial. In the past it didnt really matter who was nominally running the country as we had one of the worldrsquos most effective administrative machine.Today a weak, politicised civil service outsources to incompetent companies while co-ordinating existing organisations, such as NHS laboratories or local public health departments, is far beyond an organisation which is afraid to speak truth to power.Rev Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.AM I the only one noticing the disparities between how the UK Government deals with the EU trade deal talks compared to those with the US There seems to be no real will to engage with the EU: accusations of truculence and blocking deals are branded on both sides. Time is running out, yet there seems no political will on the side of the UK to extend the talks despite the Covid crisis.On the other hand, trade talks with the US are going swimmingly: the firm promise of Boris Johnson not to open the UK market to chlorinated chicken has already been broken hormone-fed beef will no doubt follow. All the rules, regulations and in particular: protections that our membership of the EU brought with it will be broken, one by one.

First: how should we treat farm animals in Scotland  Second: do we want Scotland to have the highest standards becausewe do, why is the Scottish Government allowing a practice thatrsquos no longer happening in England  And third: will we learn lessons from Covid  Because in Scotland we still disrespect animals in ways that have spread disease in the past and could do so again in the future.I have to say here that, until I started looking into this case, I hadnrsquot properly realised Scotland was still persisting with a practice that became such an infamous issue  years ago. You may remember it: in the s, half a million male dairy calves were being exported from the UK every year, mostly for veal, but the dairy industry eventually realised ndash thanks to a campaign against the practice ndash that their image was suffering and the number of exports dropped dramatically.However, the trade does still continue and Irsquom sad to say that for the last three years the only place in Britain where itrsquos been happening is Scotland. Since , more than , calves have been exported from Scotland to Spain where they are fattened for beef. The calves are usually taken from their mothers on their first day of le and loaded on to the trucks at two weeks old. Many other male calves are shot at birth .:MSPs back animal welfare reformsAh but wasnrsquot therea whole scandal about this a couple of years ago and didnrsquot PO say they would stop carrying calves from Scotland  True, but the Scottish Government remained supportive of live exports and, after PO made their decision in , the industry switched its tactics. So now, instead of going by boat from Cairnryan, the calves are driven to Ramsgate where a ship, chartered by the exporters, takes them to France and then by road to Spain.Which is where the court case comes in. The petitioner in the case is Compassion in World Farming, the organisation that campaigns for better farming standards, and their argument is that, in allowing the export of calves to Spain, the Scottish Government is breaking the law. The Government disagrees and has appointed a QC to fight the case, although exactly what their defence will be we donrsquot yet know.What the law says is that unweaned animals should not be transported for more than eight hours unless, after nine hours, they are given water andnecessary fed. Now as far as we know, after eight hours or so, the calves from Scotland are stopped at a motorway service station in Essex and the automatic watering system in the trucks is operated. But each truck is tightly packed with up to  calves and no one goes on board to checkall the calves take the water. Chances are many donrsquot.As for feed, what calves of that age receive is milk or a milk replacement, but the trucks donrsquot have the facilities for that so for the entire journey to France , they will not be fed. What the Government may argue ndash and it would be a pretty lowdown argumentthey try it ndash is that itrsquos not necessary to feed the calves. But calves of that age feed at least twice a dayand the schedule of documents sent to the Court of Session includes an unequivocal statement from Professor Donald Broom, the UKrsquos foremost authority on animal welfare: it is necessary to give milk or milk replacement to calves that have been transported for eight or nine hours.Compassion in World Farming say the Scottish Government has also tried to argue ndash surprise, surprise ndash that the problem arises in England and when I got in touch with the Government, they said it would be inappropriate to comment while legal proceedings were ongoing. They did, however, say they were committed to consulting on the recommendations of the Farm Animal Welfare Committee, which includes a nine-hour limit on journeys for calves. ldquoOur preferred policy intention, said the spokesman, ldquois not to support unnecessary long journeys involved in the export of livestock.But a statement like that raises more questions than answers. First, why support exports anyway - the UK imports a lot of beef so why not use the male dairy calves for beef in this country  Secondly, evenyou think live exports are a good idea, why fight a case over a time limit you say you support  And thirdly, is the fight really worth it  The calves being exported represent the rump of an industry that isnrsquot even economically signicant any more. Do we really want to be the last place in Britain where this happens :Opinion: Mark Smith: Why is Nicola Sturgeon not taking more flak over coronavirus  Ah yes: the English get-out clauseAnd perhaps the fact that the case is happening in the middle of a pandemic should also give the Government pause for thought. If you havenrsquot watched the recent webinar with the celebrated primatologist Jane Goodall, I recommend it. She didnrsquot hold back. Humans have brought coronavirus on ourselves, she said, because of our disrespect for animals that have been pushed closer into contact with each other, and theyrsquove been pushed closer together in markets, on intensive farms, and in trucks parked up at motorway service stations in Essex.So what happens now  The case against the Scottish Government is due to be heard on August th and campaigners on animal welfare will be keeping a close eye on it. Therersquos also an awareness day on live exports this Sunday. The aim, in the end, is to stop live exports all together and the hope is that the Scottish Government will show some sense. What wersquore realising is it may take a judgment of the Court of Session to make that happen.Our columns are a  for our writers to express their opinions.

figure than Tony Blair did that night, since he was handing over  per cent of the population of British Dependent Territories ndash about . million people ndash to a despotic regime notoriously indferent to human rights and officially founded on Leninism, as modied by Mao and Chinarsquos then leader, Deng Xiaoping, whose catchy maxim was ldquoPractice is the sole criterion for the truth.Well,yoursquore entirely pragmatic, or cynical, you might take that as no more than a statement of the obvious in politics. And to be fair to Mr Blair, who had only just become Prime Minister, the terms of the settlement were largely set by the negotiations during Margaret Thatcherrsquos time in government which were initially led by Sir Edward Heath, with his stellar record of undermining UK interests. Standing up to China, admittedly, wasnrsquot an easy task then ndash when Deng told Mrs Thatcher he could ldquotake the whole lot in an afternoon she admitted there wasnrsquot anything she could do to stop it ndash and it may be even harder now.Fat Pangdid try to do something to safeguard the interests of the citizens of Hong Kong by expanding the democratic franchise but, as is now apparent, you canrsquot really do a great deal to protect human rights when the incoming government is a dictatorship.So the current Governmentrsquos proposed provision that,China imposes its national security law ndashwith extradition to the mainland ndash all Hong Kong holders of a British National Overseas passportshould be entitled to come to the UK with the right to work for at least  months is a welcome step.Of course, it would have been betterwersquod simply offered that ndash as some of us argued at the time ndash to all Hong Kong residents about  years ago, just as it would have been betterwersquod extended a similar offer to other Commonwealth citizens, rather than Theresa Mayrsquos policy of illegally deporting members of the Windrush generation. But itrsquos not just a question of it being the right thing to do it would very obviously be in the countryrsquos best interests.One result of Brexit is that opposition to immigration has fallen: according to some surveys, from about  per cent a decade ago to about  per cent now. Though I regret the end of free movement with the EU countries, it at least has the consequence that the UK can control immigration. That shouldnrsquot mean limiting it on the contrary, it should allow us to open our borders to necessary workers, and the best talent from anywhere in the world.The current population of Hong Kong, one of the wealthiest and healthiest on the planet, looks a particularly attractive prospect. But itrsquos no accident that a lump of rock in the Pearl River Delta, with no advantages other than a good natural harbour, should have become so successful.Hong Kong exists because of trade. Any place without natural resourcescan only survive through trade. As Tai-Pan, James Clavellrsquos fictionalised version of its origins, depicts it, that was initially smuggling, piracy, tea and opium.What a boon its industrious and inventive population would be to our economy. But we should go further. There is the opportunity not only to accommodate the people of Hong Kong, but to replicate the conditions that made it so successful.The obvious thing to do is to set up some new jurisdiction within the UK, but modelled on Cowperthwaitersquos principles: the Isle of Man, Gibraltar and the Channel Islands are already precedents for such a distinction. A low-tax freeport and financial centre right on our doorstep would have obvious benefits for the rest of the country, while,it were very lightly regulated, it would create housing and employment opportunities not just for immigrants, but for UK citizens.It could potentially create exactly the sort of major, galvanising transformation of the economy that would lt us out of the recession that is certain to follow our current crisis, and to provide a shot in the arm and signal of intent that ought to follow our departure from the EU. The fact that the EU would hate the idea might also be a useful point in trade negotiations.Whatrsquos more,located in the right sort of area, it could realign the whole country, balancing the disproportionate dominance of London. Ideally, for trading reasons, it should be on the coast and near a major airport. For unionist reasons, but also in the interests of geographical spread of wealth from London towards the north and west in general, it would be particularly goodit were located in Scotland.You wouldnrsquot need much space: Hong Kong island is only about  sq km, and the new free city could start off quite a bit smaller. A modest start would be to transform Millport into something more along the lines of Singapore, exempting it from UK and Scottish taxes. If that turns out to be so successful that it outgrows Great Cumbrae, the next step would be to annex Rothesay.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

I despise both slavery, and the fact that it happened. We cannot however rewrite history.Our efforts now should be aimed at ceasing the ious forms of slavery still with us, rather than toppling a statue into Bristol Harbour.Gordon Casely, Crathes.HOW we cheered when the Berlin Wall was dismantled by the citizens of that city. How we applauded when the statue of Saddam Hussein was pulled from its plinth by residents of Baghdad. How sad then that some politicians have concentrated on the negative, when the good people of Bristol finally got rid of a statue in that city, erected in the memory of a slave trader. We can only be liberated from the chains of the past, when the glorication of past evil comes to an end.It may be that few memorials to the past would pass a test of modernday morality, but as with Covid-, hindsight is a marvellous thing.GR Weir, Ochiltree.IT is high time this country recognised its contribution to the American slave trade and that the entire country benefited financially, one way or the other, from this appalling industry ndash be it employment or the buildings donated by those who made money from this industry.Tearing down statues, be it Edward Colston or others who \"financially benefitted\", does not obliterate that terrible stain on our history.I suggest that the authorities remove all similar monuments and gt them to museums with the implicit instruction that they create an appropriate place where we can all, every one of us, quietly reflect on the sins of our forebears and register our disgust that this was done in our name.Nothing can change Britains history but recognising and accepting its contribution to that appalling industry might start to correct an appalling wrong.Alan McKinney, Edinburgh EH.SOME months ago I wrote to suggest that an appropriate monument or statue be erected in the Merchant Cityto commemorate the Unknown Slave. Perhaps this might now be an appropriate time to consider that proposal again.I do wonder, however,the recent \"renaming\" of Cochrane Street might have been an error.As most will realise, Glasgowrsquos street plan recognises many of the events and personalities involved in the Napoleonic Wars.Is it possible that Cochrane Street recognises one of Scotlandrsquos most iconic military figures from that era Admiral Cochraneis still revered in much of South America for his later role in ending European colonialism on that continent.If this is the case, it would be a shame to lose that link to a man who made, within the context of the era in which he lived, a positive and sometimes radical contribution to the World as we now know it.In the meantime, maybe the establishment of the memorial to the Unknown Slave might be just the beginning of this generation of the city recognising and understanding the dark role that the horric and inhuman institution of human slavery has had and still has on Glasgowrsquos growth and success.Ian Graham, Erskine.I WAS saddened to see the word \"racist\" being used in connection with Scotlandrsquos police force.It made me think: who are our police officers They are our neighbours, our friends, our families, the people we socialise with. In short they are a reflection of our Scottish society.So is Scotland racist I imagine there is not a country in the world that is free of racism and as such Scotland equally has its problems. However, Scotland is also a very welcoming country and over the years we have seen people from many erse countries come and make their homes here. My own ancestry is with the Irish migration which arrived here in the mid th century. Growing up in the west of Scotland  years later was not always the easiest thing to do.We are a erse country but not as erse as many. Many of the aspects of our lives are still not reflective of that ersity. These include politics, government, the police, the fire service, sport and on and on. Governments of every colour have sought to address that problem and although progress has been made, there is still a long way to go.So back to my original point about racism in the police. That is no more true than recognising that there is racism in Scotland.In recognising that, we must work towards education and the emphasis on the very real positives that ersity offers.George Kay, Burntisland.BLACK Lives Matter protests, many of which have not limited numbers enough to make social distancing possible, are likely to cost many times more lives ndash and mostly black ones ndash than all the killings of black people by police in the last  years. How is spreading a virus, so it kills thousands more people before effective treatments or a vaccine have been found, valuing anyonersquos le While there is certainly still lots of racism on both sides of the Atlantic, those who say ldquothey would never have done that to a white guy are wrong. Only eight per cent of the people who die in police custody in the UK are black. Almost half of people shot dead by police in the US are white.Yes, more black people are killed relative to their percentage of the population crime is commoner, and racism. But there are cases of US police murdering white people almost identical to George Floydrsquos. Tony Timpa, a schizophrenic white man phoned  asking for help because hersquod come off his medication. Police arrived, forced him face down, and knelt, laughing, on his neck and back, as he said ldquoyoursquore going to kill me, for  minutes till he died. Charges brought against the three police were dropped despite video evidence.Daniel Shaver, also white, was unarmed in a hallway, with video of a police officer alternately shouting ldquoget on the floor, hands down and ldquohands in the air then shooting him dead. The officer was found not guilty of murder, and given a , annual pension for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder .Black Lives Matter protesters could get much wider support by creating a movement against police brutality and impunity against all victims, of whatever skin colour. And the assumption that police are always ldquothe good guys which allows the worst to get off with murder.Duncan McFarlane, Carluke.REFERENCE to the demonstrators on Glasgow Green and attempts at social distancing recalled a little of why I am proud to be a Glaswegian. On the other hand, television pictures of thugs throwing bicycles, bricks and fireworks at the police made me reflect on history and how easy it is to point the finger at dubious norms in the past whilst refusing to accept that we today are forming the history of tomorrow.Our concern at the pollution of the planet seems to have been overcome by our desire to get on a plane for a holiday, instead of taking the opportunity to make signicant changes. Our rightful concern to tackle the apparent health disadvantage of black people to Covid-, doesnt seem to stretch to the disadvantaged in the east end of our cities, where an address means a restricted choice of job applications and a lower expectation of le.If we really care and want to avoid future criticism, then surely, we must speak out against our actions by default in Yemen and Syria we must accept a lowering of our living standards to ensure others enjoy our benefits and surely we must consider repaying an equivalent to the ill-gained fortune on which many of our cities were built accepting a standstill in economic progress until the Third World catches up, and abandon the fashion business, social media and \"keeping up with the Joneses\" until a more equitable society is achieved.Japan after the tsunami was a great example where  per cent voted to abolish the nuclear power programme and go back to other means of production, until prices went up and % then voted to bring back nuclear power.

We are all horried at the death of George Floyd but this is no way to honour him or support the Black Lives Matter movement. Why have those participating in country-wide marches been allowed to put the safety of the rest of the population at risk at a time we are assured when we are still in danger from the virus If there is a second wave of the virus I will have no dficulty in knowing who to blame ndash the marchers. How dare they at a time of national crisis Let us also remember that the situation in the United States regarding the status of black people is very dferent from that in the UK. There is a dferent history there no matter what the British involvement in slavery in the past.

The Silver-washed Fritillary and White Admiral, classic butterflies of summer woodland in southern Britain, were both seen on May , two weeks earlier than usual.The rare Large Blue, successfully reintroduced to Britain in the s, made its earliest ever appearance this year.Dr Fox said that while a trend of early emergences was a cause for concern, some butterfly populations were able to adapt.A lack of rainfall since February, he said, could be a greater concern for some of the insects, as vegetation was parched, leaving caterpillars to starve.He said: ldquoButterflies are able to adjust their emergence dates to suit the vagaries of the UK weather, indeed they need to do so to remain in sync with the plants that their caterpillars need to feed on.ldquoHowever, the trend towards earlier emergence of butterflies and moths in Britain over recent decades in response to climate change isnrsquot necessarily beneficial.ldquoRecent research shows that emerging earlier leads to larger populations of species that have more than one generation each year. In such species, the earlier emergence of the first generation leads to greater abundance in the second brood.ldquoHowever, for species that only have one generation each year, this positive effect on numbers was not found. Indeed, for some, more specialised species, there was a negative impact -- earlier emergence led to reduce population size.ldquoProlonged dry weather is likely to be worse for butterflies that live in open habitats with thin soils, such as chalk downland. The Duke of Burgundy butterfly, for example, lays its eggs on the leaves of cowslips and primroses, which quickly become desiccated in dry weather.The figures come ahead of Butterfly Conservationrsquos Big Butterfly Count, the largest citizen science project in the UK, which last year saw more than , people take part.Dr Fox added: ldquoThis year will be particularly interesting. We will be looking to seespecies that emerged early and have their second generation during the Count do particularly well, and whether single-generation species, such as Marbled White, are still about in July for all of our Big Butterfly Count participants to record.ldquoAll of this helps us to lsquotake the pulse of naturersquo and understand the effects of climate change and human impacts on the health of our wildle.Although many butterflies tend to appear in Scotland up to a month later than they do in England, the insects were also recorded much earlier than usual north of the Border.The Big Butterfly Count runs between July  and August ."},{"url":null,"title":"ministers-told-step-plate-scotlands-environment","story":"The Scottish Environment LINKcoalition of more than  leading charities remains concerned that not enough is being done to protect the nations natural environment, wildle and air and water quality are safeguarded as the UK quits Europe at the end of the year.And it has said that Scotland can move into a post-Covid economic recovery by going green, acting ethically and helping to save the planet from climate change while protecting Scotlands world-renowned landscape and species.It believes Scotland has the opportunity to become a circular economy which makes manufacturers responsible for what happens to the goods they produce, reducing waste to curb the disposable society and protect our environment.A wide-ranging survey carried out for SEL shows some three in four agree that the government should wherever possible only allow materials that are practicably and safely recycled to be sold in Scotland.Some % agreed with the statement that in Scotland we should use raw materials more wisely and waste less.People also think that the Government should take an active role in the reduction of our demands on raw materials with over three in four agreeing with the statement that it should introduce a target and a plan on how to reduce the amount of raw materials used.The Scottish government has set itself a legally-binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by , five years ahead of the date set for the UK as a whole.Phoebe Cochrane, circular economy lead for SEL said: ldquoThe Scottish government must ensure we put the circular economy at the heart of our post COVID- recovery measures rather than supporting practices that lock us into a linear, polluting and unsustainable economy.Eighty percent of respondents supported a ban on all environmentally harmful single-use items where there are practical re-usable alternatives.People also think that businesses should be more responsible, with % agreeing they should have a responsibility for the environmental impact of their products. While % agree that supermarkets should report publicly on their waste and % believed they should also report publicly on the waste from their supply chains.It comes as part of the SELrsquos Fight for Scotlandrsquos Nature campaign which is seeking the Scottish Government produce stronger policies to protect our environment as Brexit is concluded.Among their concerns has been a method to replace the European Commissionrsquos LIFE-Nature Fund which has given pound million over  years to Scotland to help with more than  vital conservation projects protecting the countryrsquos at-risk wildle and landscape.They previously warned the losers would include a bid to stop Scotlandrsquos red squirrels from becoming extinct, as well as moves to protect the hen harrier, harbour porpoise and the corncrake, one of Scotlandrsquos rarest birds.LIFE has also helped preserve some of Scotlandrsquos treasured landscape because of their European importance.Receiving support was the restoration of the Flow Country peatlands in Caithness, one of the last great wildernesses in the UK and the preservation of primeval Celtic rainforest, the native Caledonian pinewoods and Scotlandrsquos coastal meadows, called machair.The  Global Resource Outlook shows that extracting and processing raw materials from fossil fuels and mining to food and biofuels is responsible for half the worldrsquos carbon emissions and % of bioersity loss.The consumption of natural resources, which has tripled since the  s, is set to further double by .SEL said: \"We are consuming far more than our fair share andeveryone lived like us, we would need about three Earths to sustain ourselves, according to ecological footprint data. The coalition urged government to be bold in supporting a circular economy as part of the recovery saying: \"Prior to the recent abrupt downturn in economic activity, our economy was eating its way through the worlds natural resources at a rate that was both environmentally unsustainable and undesirable from an economic resilience point of view.\"Currently our economy is wasteful - we generally grow or extract raw materials, make products, use them and then, at the end of their le, discard them. We need to re-programme our economy to extract less from the planet, reuse what weve already taken and reduce our waste.\"People are frustrated with the way that products are made and how it is often dficult and costly to get things repaired.\"Their survey, carried out by Survation showed that % agreed that when possible, products should be made so that they are easy to repair and their components can be re-used.They also think that everyone having access to repair services is important and the Government should be proactive, with % agreeing that ministers should make sure that people have access to repair and re-use services as well as recycling services.And % agree ministers should use available powers to encourage companies to make products sold in Scotland repairable and re-useable.Matthew Crighton, convener of SEL s economics group said:  The coronavirus crisis has brought into sharp focus, for us all, the importance of our natural environment and how much we depend on it for our wellbeing. A move towards a circular economy is pivotal in meeting our climate change obligations and ensuring a resilient economy for the greater good.Trade unionists are also suggesing that a new ldquoindustrial revolution can go green with the help of a new Future Jobs Fund to help the unemployed and a publicly owned ethical construction company.The Scottish Trades Union Congress has revealed it wants to see the fund back a construction and ldquodeep retrofit housing programme, to make existing homes more environmentally friendly, while creating ldquogood quality jobs and driving decarbonisation of heat, reducing emissions and fuel bills."},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners-call-education-revision-comes-slaving-past","story":"Petitioners lobbied Glasgow City Council calling for street names memorialising slave traders in the city to be changed.But Anne McLaughlin, SNP MP, who had initially backed the plans, has made a u-turn, acknowledging that renaming Glassford, Buchanan, Ingram and Gordon streets, would ldquoerase our history.Instead she called for the addition of plaques ldquoexplaining who they were, how many slaves they owned and how much money they made from them.Last weekend, ahead of Sundayrsquos Black Lives Matters protest in Glasgow Green, anti-racist campaigners placed placards under street names that have links to the slave trade, replacing them with the names of black activists, slaves and victims of police violence.Cochrane Street - named after Andrew Cochrane, an th century tobacco tycoon- was renamed Sheku Bayoh Street.Buchanan Street, named after a slave owner, became George Floyd Street, while Wilson Street was rebranded Rosa Parks Street, after the American civil rights activist.Barrington Reeves, the organiser behind Sundayrsquos demonstration that saw thousands of peaceful protestors unite against racism, told The Herald: ldquoI donrsquot think [changing the street names] does anything to help solve the problem, instead we should be addressing Glasgowrsquos links to the slave trade. We need education - erasure is almost more damaging than them being there in first place.ldquoA lot of racism in Scotland is born out of sheer ignorance. There are far more constructive ways to educate people than removing names and pulling down statues.Glasgow City Council confirmed yesterday that banners from the protest will be preserved to display in the future.Speaking on the street name campaign Labour MSP, Anas Sarwar, said: ldquoI would rather our energy was spent on campaigning to eradicate racism now. I think itrsquos important, though, that we recognize our history.ldquoThe bigger structural issues that are happening in our education system, our employment system, our criminal justice system is a much much more important campaign that we should be looking at.The local authorities in Glasgow and Edinburgh, cities which benefitted from slavery for centuries, are conducting a review of how historical figures with links to the slave trade are depicted.Sir Geoff Palmer, Professor Emeritus at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, was involved in a consultation two years ago on adding a plaque to the statue of Henry Dundas, the st Viscount Melville and the man who delayed the abolition of slavery for  years, in the capital.Scotlandrsquos first Black professor criticised City of Edinburgh council for reaching no agreement.He said: I canrsquot accept a plaque that does not have lsquoslaveryrsquo on it.ldquoThe council leader has said on Twitter that he will discuss the plaque with other councillors today.ldquoWhat is sad about this is that when the black public sees something like this, should they be surprised the attempt to find any form of reparation or justice has been delayed so long Previously Sir Palmer told BBC Scotland that he didnrsquot want existing statues to be taken down.He said: ldquoMy view is you remove the evidence, you remove the deed. The past has consequences and a lot of people forget that. Racism is a consequence of the past.His remarks came after protestors pulled down a controversial statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, before throwing it into the harbour on Sunday.The move was condemned by Westminster, with Boris Johnson calling it ldquoa criminal act despite Avon and Somerset Police police deciding not to intervene.The prime ministerrsquos official spokesman said: ldquoPeople can campaign for the removal of a statue but what happened was a criminal act and when the criminal law is broken that is unacceptable."},{"url":null,"title":"without-slavery-glasgow-wouldnt-exist-brutal-truth-scotlands-slaving-past","story":"Glasgow is celebrated for its art, academia and song, its multiculturalism and its warmth but scrape that surface and youll find a dferent story lurking beneath.It is a tale of people, considered to be only partially human, stolen from their lands and trafficked across the seas to labour camps, the profits of which were used to build the Glasgow we know today.This brutal history is one that the Coalition for Racial Equality and Rightsis campaigning to have included in the Scottish Curriculum and memorialised in a museum of Empire, Slavery and Colonialism.CRER organises Black History Month, an annual event that counters the hidden histories of African, Caribbean and Asian people in Scotland.: Calls for anti-racist education to be taught in Scottish schoolsThroughout October they held a Sunday walking tour around Glasgows city centre and its mercantile past, examining its sinister entanglement with the Transatlantic slave trade.At the David Livingstone statue in Cathedral Square, guides Anabelle Njenga and Yvonne Blake point out the friezes that encircle the celebrated adventurer and missionary credited for converting many African countries to Christianity. In one, an enslaved man is whipped by another man wearing a turban - an attempt at whitewashing the extent of Scotlands involvement while pointing a bloody finger at middle eastern and north African slave traders.The propagandist statue was built to distance Glasgow from its slaving past - here was a Scot who not only discovered the continent but saved Africans through Christianity in the process, so the story goes. Except, he had a \"tour guide\" says Ms Njenga, who cleared the explorers path through the undergrowth, as seen on the statue. \"He discovered nothing.\"Its vital to be clear-eyed about this history, she says. There lies real threat in \"the lingering stereotypes that the conditions of slavery were better than living in Africa\".In the th century, Scotland saw the grotesque wealth England was amassing as a result of the triangular slave trade - enslaved people exchanged for goods then sold into servitude and their crops ed to be traded.Scots were so well regarded for their cruelty they were in high demand to run plantations where the average survival rate for enslaved people was three to five years, they were worked so hard.The proximity of tobacco merchants Andrew Buchanan and Richard Oswalds graves to the Cathedral - one directly outside the entrance, the other in the nave - show exactly how much clout they held in the city. These men, and the others like them, wielded political power, Buchanan as Lord Provost and Oswald, as one of the brokers of s Treaty of Paris.Despite media publications at the time of Abolition in  professing that \"not one brick of Glasgow\" was built on the broken backs of enslaved people, the history books beg to dfer.A sum of pound million, or pound billion in todayrsquos money, was paid to the slavers - despite their offensive wealth - to compensate for lost trade. A tax only paid off in  by all of us.Ms Blake says she balks when she hears the citys slogan, Let Glasgow Flourish.She said: \"Let Glasgow flourish on the children thrown as bait to the crocodiles, on the women being raped and torn away from their breastfeeding children. When people say there were not involved, they were involved. They were involved up to their neck.\"It was not only the wealthy merchants the streets are named after, Ingram, Glassford, Buchanan and Dundas, who were culpable, but the Glaswegians who worked in administrative roles and processed the tobacco and sugar that passed through.: Boris Johnson does not believe UK is lsquoracist countryrsquoThe city had a \"disproportionate\" involvement with the slave economies, despite its calculated cover up.The Stirling family who held the estates of Keir, near Dunblane and Cadder, in the north of Glasgow hastily changed their family crest post abolition, removing the silhouette of a Black mans head signying their trade and replacing it with a gleaming white swan, as can be seen in the stained glass windows of the Cathedral.The main thoroughfares built by merchants so they could have comfortable passage from their palatial homes to the counting rooms that totted up their wealth, the parks built as play areas for their wives and children and the commercial buildings rising from the piles of bodies of enslaved Africans are all a legacy of Glasgow, and Scotlands, heavy involvement in the slave trade.It is a history that needs to be remembered, argue Ms Blake and Ms Njenga. Particularly in a cultural climate that is leaning to the right and elevating politicians and commentators that trade in racism, hatred and misogyny.Ms Blake said: \"Slavery is not in the past because even today people are benefitting from it.\"If this history was known a lot of stereotypes would not be as strong. These stereotypes are harmful to everybody\"After visiting the site of the Tontine Heads, where sugar was traded, the Old College, Glasgow Universitys first incarnation, and the Merchant City area, the tour comes to a close outside the Gallery of Modern Art, built as an extension to sugar and tobacco trader William Cunninghames mansion.Ms Njenga said: \"Glasgow used to be  streets but because of the wealth of the slave traders it expanded.

We are rightly proud in the Northern Isles of having some of the highest standards of produce in the world. Farmers and consumers alike deserve peace of mind about fair standards and fair prices for the food we produce and eat.He continued: “I am astonished that the government has leapt directly from denying earlier this year that lower food standards would be permitted to defending this policy turn wholeheartedly. Undercutting farmers and crofters is not what was promised about the “brave new world” of future trade deals.“It is concerning that the government seems more interested in carrying water for Donald Trump and his #America First# mentality than in supporting our farmers. The government should be accountable to the people they represent, not the whims of US negotiators.”Speaking in the House earlier in the week, Mr Carmichael highlighted the potential impact to farmers and crofters in the Northern Isles: “I would like to hear what the Government’s response is to press reports today that the Government are set to open British markets to food products produced to lower US standards as part of the trade deal with Donald Trump. This was the rhetoric we were given by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: he told us that there would never be chlorinated chicken on our plate.“Now, in fact, we hear that as a consequence of the so-called dual tarf process it is quite possible that we will see such products being imported to this country. In fact, we are told that the Secretary of State for International Trade is arguing that these tarfs should be reduced to zero over  years, giving farmers time to adjust to the new “normal”.“For the farmers and crofters in my constituency, it will be a hard reality for them to survive in. Because we are a long distance from the market, we have not gone for mass-produced food. We have sought to improve the quality of the products we have and put into market with a view to export. Tarfs on those export markets will be absolutely fatal to the agricultural interests of the highlands and islands.”Responding for the government, the Paymaster General, Penny Mordaunt MP, said: “I fully understand why he may be sceptical about trusting the government, but trust the people. They value animal welfare, we should trust the consumer and there are massive opportunities for our farmers for rest of world trade.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, we are asking you, for now, to please stay within, or close to, your own local area. And don’t use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary.”The first steps out of lockdown could only involve “careful and cautious” changes, she said.In Orkney, this means that travel on public bus and inter-island ferry and air services will continue to be for essential reasons only during Phase One, with passenger numbers severely restricted as a result of and in line with social distancing requirements.Across Scotland it is assessed that social distancing will reduce transport capacity by  per cent –  per cent and this figure is very much in line with the assessment in Orkney for our ferries and local bus services.During Phase One, there will be no changes to the current timetables for local bus, ferry and inter-island air services.For Orkney Ferries, the aim is to help protect residents in the isles from the risk of infection – along with the crews who operate the service – and to ensure that the ferries can continue to run and deliver freight and other essential supplies.The Scottish Government’s new guidance, published on Tuesday , will help public transport operators and passengers prepare for the further lting of lockdown restrictions at a future date.Detailed information from the government on the newly announced Public Transport Guidance has been sent to the council. Careful consideration is being given to how this might apply locally when the move to Phase Two begins.The guidance does state that people should wear face coverings when using public transport and further information on the council’s expectations on this will be provided in due course.The government has acknowledged that there will be geographic challenges in implementing the guidance and that there can be no ‘one size fits all’ to the approach taken across Scotland.The government’s latest travel advice is available here: https:www.transport.gov.scot coronavirus-covid- transport-transition-plan advice-on-how-to-travel-safely copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Here is how some companies have been helped, and what is available.CASE STUDYIt was a week that felt like a year for Neil Lapping, chief adventure officer at Glasgow-based Macs Adventure, as the crippling impact of the Coronavirus on the travel industry became clear. The thriving guided tour business, accustomed to  per cent year-on-year growth, first saw international bookings collapse before a deluge of cancellations from domestic customers. Neil said: “It was emotionally devastating. We went from a growing and profitable business to zero revenue coming. “It was a week that felt like a year and I was in tears again and again.currently enlisted. The company also received £m from Barclays from the UK Government-backed Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme .“We have been able to retain our  staff in the UK through the furlough scheme. We would have been unable to pay them with zero revenue coming in. The CBILS has allowed us to cover our overheads including rent, rates and IT systems.”“Once we made a furlough claim the funds were released quickly and it is great news that it has been extended until October.”Neil said that Macs Adventure was well-positioned for the recovery in the travel market and that the Coronavirus had accelerated industry trends. He said: “It will take us between three to five years to rebuild the business however we are very well-placed to recover. “The market for impactful and active travel is growing.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers:Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at www.gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At the Sandwick Manse, he kept a daily record for  years, beginning in , and became a recognised expert on Scotland’s weather.After Clouston’s death, the station moved around Orkney but kept going right up until WWII. Magnus Spence ran it in Deerness for almost thirty years,  – . His son, Magnus Thorfinn Spence, was Chief Meteorologist for Bomber Command during WWII. With very neat symmetry, the story now moves to the other end of the world # to the South Orkney Islands. Base Orcadas is an Argentinian weather station but it was founded in  by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, led by William Spiers Bruce. His grandmother was Charity Isbister, whose father Caleb owned Ness Farm, Stromness. Spiers Bruce went to the Antarctic as a scientist on a whaling expedition in  and became fascinated by the polar regions. He went on expeditions to the Arctic and, when he couldn’t get there, he went to the top of Ben Nevis, which had snow cover for  days of the year. An Observatory had been built there in  by the Scottish Meteorological Society, to try to learn more about weather patterns. The first Superintendent was RTOmond, the son of Robert Omond from Kirkwall, who became President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Mary Traill, daughter of Professor Thomas Stewart Traill, . Omond was involved with the Observatory right from its planning stages. Ill health forced him down from the summit after seven years, but he remained in overall charge until the Observatory closed in . William Spiers Bruce had applied to join Scott’s expedition to the Antarctic. When, despite being one of the most experienced Polar scientists in the country, his application was rejected, he raised the funds for an expedition supported by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of - is not as famous as those of Scott and Shackleton but it has been described as one of the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientic expeditions of the age. As well as establishing the weather station, the expedition brought back a large number of botanical, biological, zoological and geological samples. The house built for the men and their instruments was called Omond House. As well as giving Spiers Bruce a lot of practical and scientic advice, Omond had given a very sizeable donation to the expedition.The Ben Nevis Observatory only lasted eighteen years and only had three observers so it is strange that there is still more Orcadian involvement. According to his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Charles Anderson, from Moa in Stenness, was the Superintendent there after he graduated in . He quickly realised he wanted to be somewhere warmer and went to work at the Australian Museum in Sydney in , eventually becoming its director.The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. A biography Charles Anderson is available on the #People# page of www.aboutorkney. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The minister has agreed to look at Mr McArthur’s suggestion and highlighted that the government is looking at a range of ways to offer support to farmers.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “The COVID- outbreak has forced ious initiatives planned by SNH and the Orkney Greylag Goose Management group to be put on hold. As a result, local farmers have been faced with having to spend more time and resources trying to keep resident greylag geese numbers under control.“I know from seeing first-hand the impact that greylag geese can have on crops and farmland. Over recent years, as the resident Greylag population has increased, so too has the damage and the cost of trying to address the problem. “It would seem sensible, therefore, to use any funding earmarked for the earlier control measures to help reduce the financial burden on farmers having to take steps themselves. This could include contributing to the cost of cartridges, but there may be other options available.“I’m pleased that the minister responded positively to this suggestion and agree to explore the options for providing such support, as well as wider efforts to bring Orkney’s resident Greylag goose population down to more sustainable levels.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

If born in Delhi then you might be Hindi or Sikh.Kenyans are more likely to be Christian.In Scotland, your type of Christianity might also depend on location catholics and protestants coming from fairly well-defined geographical areas.Of course, culture is more than religion, but even for non-adherents and atheists, it is often a signicant part of the richness of the societies we live in.I was in Bali, Indonesia earlier this year during the festival of Galungan.The place was literally dripping with decorations.Ornate and huge ‘penjor’ lined the roads and adorned buildings, taller than telegraph poles and more prevalent, they were beautully twisted and plaited from palm fronds.Shrines and offerings were everywhere. It was vibrant, colourful and beautul. It was a religious festival, but totally embedded in the culture of the Balinese, in the way Christmas is in Scotland.Balinese people are among the friendliest I have come across in all my travels, a genuine and warmth in their demeanour.Balinese folk are brown in colour, because it is very sunny in Indonesia they have evolved to have more melanin, and therefore more protection against the sun.We don’t choose the colour of our skin, or the culture we are born into, but what we do with our lot is a product of our upbringing, our wider society experience and everything that has happened to us.Most of our behaviour is due to nurture not nature, and is down to choice.Our values and empathies lie in our reaction to our experience and learning from consequence. The problem stems in that much of that experience lies out with our control.If we are black, poor and have been persecuted by institutional society since birth, we might take to the streets.When pepper sprayed, or met with water canon, rubber bullet or tear gas, we might resort to throwing rocks, petrol bombs.Windows might be broken, we might loot.If our role model father figure was a gun toting white supremacist, we might believe ourselves to have a greater entitlement than those of a dferent colour.We would be wrong.These are extreme examples # rationalising and trying to understand the actions of others is fraught with generalisation and perhaps cliché.We can never know what makes a person act the way they do, and we can only imagine being in their shoes, and seeing through the lens of their eyes.What is as tragic as a police officer killing another human being in a slow, seemingly deliberate fashion, is that a society, a culture and its institution can produce someone capable and accepting of such an action.I hope the killer will be brought to justice, and that a grieving family can find peace and forgiveness, but more importantly can we heal the society that produces this behaviour.Most of the ills are due to poverty, deprivation, and the inequality of opportunity.Fear and ignorance is layered on top, with greed and entitlement. Power normally resides with the rich, who want to stay rich.The cry is that we are all the same underneath, black, white, brown yellow, and yet we are all dferent, unique, products of vastly dferent culture, geography, upbringing, beliefs and experience.We are both the same and both dferent, and this confusing contradiction should be embraced, celebrated and above all respected.Scotland is known for celebrating ersity, but it is more than the music, the festivals, the ceremonies and the food, it is the people and their attitudes and their experience we should celebrate.It may be sometime before visitors from other continents arrive back to the Highlands in any number, but our communities as hosts are in a perfect situation to embrace the cultures brought and above all respect both dferences and similarities.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine..Bha an cunntas agam mu mhurt Dhòmhnaill mhic Uilleim ann an sgìre Chnoc Mhoire faisg air a’ Mhanachainn.

became a bit too much and we decided to enjoy ourselves.The course was full.The sun was shining.Genuinely it was hotter than it had been in Florida last October.‘Things’, generally couldn’t be better.We will, naturally, spend a couple of weeks ‘acclimatising’ before we plunge headlong into competitive golf proper.That night my legs and feet ached, my back required some WD, but a’ bhalaich, I was a happy bunny.I wasn’t alone.Who was keeping score anyway Colin MacRitchie’s playing partner on Saturday, that’s who.Whilst some of us require several layers of cobwebs to be removed before we can be considered ‘contenders’ the talented require nothing more than a robust practice swing.Starting with a bogey, , at the ‘Castle’, nobody could have predicted the explosives to follow.Yes it was just a ‘bounce’ round and yes, we were still only playing off the yellow tees: but that didn’t detract much from the incredulity with which his card was greeted.From the second hole he went birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie, eagle, birdieto be ‘out’ in a breath-taking, -under, .He started back with yet another brace of birdies before completely losing form and racking up ‘just’ seven straight pars.  #         # Going round anywhere, at any time, in  blows is a stunning achievement.It certainly posts a warning to the other serious contenders for the summer season and the ‘majors’ ahead, however truncated it they may be.The Scarista faithful, too, were busy finding themselves at the weekend.Nobody was too keen to blow anything resembling the remotest trumpet, regards any semi-official scoring but the sense I got was that greenkeeper James Dunne was possibly the man to keep a close eye on.He spent the weekend asking about the bounce and loft on wedges.“ or  degrees loft with - degree bounce ”, he queried.Billy Fraser, who actually does know what he was talking about, chipped in with what appeared to be sound, indeed polite, advice.‘Bounce is your friend’ Captain Kuna opined.Now there’s a man in touch with his inner Barbara Woodhouse.Having latterly abandoned the notion of flailing around with a driver, or any fairway woods, James has foundthat his scoring has dramatically improved.The ‘Essence of Harris’ Trophy this Saturday may well be his opportunity to demonstrate his new-found Karma.Benbecula threw themselves straight back into competitive action with their May Medal last Saturday. Donald MacKay won with a nett , two shots ahead of Dami Steele on .Both qualy for the end of season gold medal.On Tuesday they began the season-long Order of Merit with a Willie Monkwin. Dami continued his runner-up habit.Down at Askernish they’re still probably trying to get over the shock of my naming it as my favourite course on ‘Spors na Seachdain’.I’ve been lucky enough to have played some wonderful courses these past -odd years but the South Uist links still ‘does it’ for me every time.I even considered becoming a member this year, along with Stornoway and Harris before Covid took a hold.Too far Maybe I should approach the Tiumpan Head grazings committee.What a course that would make.You’d never get me out of Point.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rosswa-logo.jpg","title":"ross shire skye and lochalsh womens aid are here for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineRoss-shire Skye and Lochalsh Women’s Aid provides services to women, children, and young people in the Ross-shire, Skye, and Lochalsh areas that are experiencing, or have experienced, the effects of domestic abuse.

These will be found because of the understanding we have of viruses, genetics and our immune system built up over many years.“A great deal of this knowledge was acquired by scientists who were simply curious about how Nature works. In that statement there is a lesson and a reason for hope.“Curiosity is a powerful thing, and science is about harnessing curiosity and honing it into the best method we have for acquiring new knowledge and exploring the unknown.“That’s what science is all about, and that’s why we need you to become the scientists of the future!

They were joined by the UUP and PUP during Monday’s meeting to continue the current system of delegated authority decision making – in which the Chief Executive Suzanne Wylie is responsible.Alliance, the SDLP, the Green Party and People Before Profit all voted for an immediateto business, with virtual meetings accessible to the public. They lost by  votes to seven.Virtual conference meetings of the party group leaders, held away from the public eye, will continue. There will be a ‘practice’ Strategic Policy and Resources meeting next week, and two more before August. There will also be a full remote council meeting with all  members in July. Ato a full agenda by remote conference, and open to the public, will begin in August.Chief Executive Suzanne Wylie said: “We do not have many staff here at City Hall at all. With some staff furloughed and many working from home, it makes things incredibly dficult.“Primarily the vast amount of time by senior managers is spent on recovery in all its forms – looking at all our offices, looking at all our facilities, when we can open them again, looking at when we can get staff back into work and how.”She said “recovery for both communities, and the wider economy,” was “taking up all the senior staff’s time at this point,” and added “It would be dficult to service all the committeesthat was to begin again tomorrow.”All of Northern Ireland’s other councils have held full council meetings, involving all councillors – which Belfast is yet to do. Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon council, Derry and Strabane Council, and Antrim and Newtownabbey Council have already announced they will resume full schedules of council and committee meetings virtually in June and July.DUP party group leader George Dorrian said: “We asked last week as group leaders a direct question of the Chief Executive, thatwe seek to continue with all these working groups, committees and meetings, are we distracting staff away from work around the recovery plan. The answer was a very clear yes.”He described the motion to resume a full agenda of meetings as grandstanding.”SDLP party group leader Donal Lyons said: “We have a lot of decisions to take, these decisions are going to be tough and in the interests of basic accountability and political transparency these decisions have to be made in a public forum.“I’m not suspecting that thousands of people will be glued to their phones or their tablets to gaze upon our every word. But they have a right should they choose to do so, and the media have the right to report what the rationale of the dferent parties were when the decisions were taken.”People Before Profit Councillor Matthew Collins said: “It’s unbelievable the idea that the reason we are not having open, democratic and public meetings is because people are too busy.” He said he was “disappointed council officers gave political cover” to continued delegated authority, and added the current situation amounted to “democracy through party group leaders.”Alliance Councillor Kate Nicholl, said later the meeting was a “farce and a complete let down” She added: “The Local Government act was changed almost two months ago to allow all Council and Committee meetings to move online quickly. This should never have been up for discussion – instead we find ourselves in a situation where four parties are content to usher in an era of closed-door decision making at City Hall. It is not acceptable.“As a ratepayer I’m angry that full openness and transparency has been removed, as an elected member I’m frustrated I’ve been blocked by others from representing those who elected me and finally I’m disappointed in all those who have stood in the way of democracy.”Belfast Most ReadExecutive to discuss easing lockdown as Economy Minister signals further retail reopeningTributes to Shane Lappin who died in accident while building new home in Co ArmaghBlack Lives Matter protesters in Northern Ireland prepared to fight fixed fines over rallies during coronavirus lockdownPubs, restaurants and shops in Northern Ireland can open on July  as coronavirus lockdown rules to be eased to save economyCouncil urged to rename Newry street called after nationalist who backed slave trade,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After the Republic announced bars can operate as restaurants from June , and all will be allowed to open on July , there is pressure on the Stormont Executive, which met on Monday, to reveal a timeline. It#s expected to announce further rule relaxations on Thursday.But according to some publicans, it is logical for Northern Ireland to operate in tandem with the south. While pub owners have received no advice and guidance on re-opening, they have their own thoughts on how it can happen, and what the experience will be like.Pedro Donald, who owns the Sunflower and the American Bar in Belfast, said the lack of guidelines makes it dficult to plan ahead, other than knowing staff will have to keep their hands clean and sanitised, and that there will be social distancing.As far as putting structures up, including screens, we are not going to do that unless we know we need to, said Mr Donald.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePedro Donald of Sunflower Bar FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPedro Donald of Sunflower BarHe added: We will not be doing sessions initially as they would need to be spread out and space is going to be a premium. The hospitality industry has warned that pubs and restaurants may be unable to reopenthe two metre social distancing rule is not reduced. The two metre rule will not work inside Mr Donald#s bars, both of which are small two-floor spaces, although the Sunflower also has a popular large outdoor area. If that rule remains in place, he said would be able to host about four people.Mr Donald said he will not be inviting or encouraging crowds to come to his premises, but he is not sure whether there will be a big rush to the pub. A lot of people might see how it is working, while others will want to go right back, he said. The Belfast bar owner expects to have the same number of staff, with less behind the bar but more on the door and policing the toilets.Willie Jack, owner of the Harp Bar, the Dark Horse and the Duke Of York, among other establishments, believes it makes sense for bars north and south to open at the same time, rather than potentially see pubs in Londonderry and Bundoran working on a dferent schedule.He believes Monday, July  is a sensible date as it would be better not to open on a pay day at the end of the month, a weekend, or a holiday like the Twelfth. A wet Monday or Tuesday night when there is no pressure, he said.The publican expects no standing or sitting at the bar, and customers being served at certain points then ing to their table. He noted that certain countries and the World Health Organisation have endorsed the one-metre rule.There will be no live music in his venues initially, then possibly single singer songwriters. Mr Jack expects capacity to be reduced to between  and % depending on what rules are put in place by the Executive.Prices might have to go up, he said, adding that he does not want to see customers partitioned by screens.A number of his establishments are in the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast, and he wants to work with the City Council to pedestrianise the area in the evening and at weekends. Managing taxi ranks and portable toilets will be vitalthat happens, Mr Jack added. Otherwise, staff are likely to be washing hands every half hour, using sanitiser but not wearing gloves or masks, the publicans said.On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the two-metre rule and said businesses may have to rely on their ingenuity to operate within the restriction. He said the rule was under review, but, ultimately, it isn#t the rule that#s the challenge to the opening of hospitality in a safe way, it#s the virus. And in the Republic, Business Minister Heather Humphreys said yesterday that the two-metre rule may be changed provided that coronavirus figures go in the right direction and the transmission rate remains low.

In Mitchel#s place of birth in Dungiven, Co Londonderry, a play park also displays his name and several GAA clubs around Ireland have honoured his memory in their names.But as the Black Lives Matter campaign takes hold across the world following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a darker side to a giant of Irish history has led to calls for tributes to the activist, author and political journalist to be removed.Now an online petition has been set up by a former Newry man, who is hoping to change his council#s opinion on celebrating his name.I grew up in Newry. I walked through John Mitchel Place every day on my way to school, said Padraig Mac Cionnaith , now living in Dunmurry.I#m not a historian and I never thought any more about the name and why there was a statue. No-one ever remarked on it. It was through chance that I found out about his beliefs and what he stood for in America in the s.This was a man who was a rebel with two causes. How can we be comfortable with remembering one while conveniently sweeping the other under the carpet Padraig will now be writing to all  councillors in Newry and Mourne calling for the street to be renamed. I don#t want this to be a green and orange political issue, that#s why I#ll be contacting every councillor, from every party, he said. When Newry is the home town to sporting legends like Pat Jennings, would it not be a better idea to honour those rather than someone who was a great advocate of slavery in the United States, no matter what his involvement in Irish nationalism was  It#s particularly relevant now with what has been happening in America. We have people standing up for rights through the Black Lives Matter campaign.People are taking to the streets, voicing their opposition in their thousands here in Northern Ireland. Yet in Newry, and where across Ireland, we are lauding one of the great supporters of slavery.In Bristol, Edward Colston#s bronze memorial, situated on Colston Avenue in the city centre, was built to honour one of the most virtuous and wise sons of Bristol. But in recent years, campaigners have expressed anger at the commemoration of a figure prominently involved in Britain#s slave-trade past, and yesterday, it was toppled.Now, Mitchel, who was born in and is often memorialised as a hero in the US and Ireland, could suffer a similar fate. A statue to Mitchel was erected in Newry#s John Mitchel Place, an extension of Newry#s main street, Hill Street.The Presbyterian was a giant of the Young Ireland movement. The British feared his influence and in a show trial convicted him of sedition and treason. Transported to Tasmania, he escaped from the penal colony in  and found his way to America.He was also one of the most extreme pro-slavery advocates of the American Civil War, calling blacks an innately inferior people and claiming that he wanted to make the people of the US proud of slavery as a national institution. He often expressed the view that slavery was inherently moral and good in itself.The petition is available at change.org by searching Rename John Mitchel Place  Belfast   Most ReadExecutive to discuss easing lockdown as Economy Minister signals further retail reopeningTributes to Shane Lappin who died in accident while building new home in Co ArmaghBlack Lives Matter protesters in Northern Ireland prepared to fight fixed fines over rallies during coronavirus lockdownPubs, restaurants and shops in Northern Ireland can open on July  as coronavirus lockdown rules to be eased to save economyCouncil urged to rename Newry street called after nationalist who backed slave trade,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, there is no doubt that it has also created an opportunity for us all to take a closer look at how we travel and consider how we can do things better moving forward, she added.“I am committed to working towards reimagining and reshaping our spaces to accommodate cycling, walking and active travel as part of an ambitious Executive recovery plan. This is a real opportunity to build a better future that delivers more for our citizens, socially and economically, delivering cleaner, greener and healthier communities. We must seize it.Ms Mallon said the cycle lanes will be put in place on a trial basis and improvements will be made in the coming weeks.The Lord Mayor of Belfast, councillor Frank McCoubrey, said connecting communities to the city centre is key to Belfast City Council and the Department for Infrastructures joint vision for the city.Improving the cycling infrastructure will make it easier for people to opt for sustainable modes of transport thereby helping to tackle things like climate change, improve air quality, and improve the health and wellbeing of those in our city – all things which make for a more sustainable, resilient future, he said.SDLP councillor for the Botanic area, Gary McKeown, described the news as a fantastic development.We have the opportunity to transform our city and how we think of it, and steps like this to link up key routes in a safer, cycle-friendly can be transformative, he said.The current pandemic has forced us all to re-evaluate how we do things, but it is allowing for some creative thinking around how we can rebuild in a greener, more sustainable way.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ad-cbf-cf-b-cfecfa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ad-cbf-cf-b-cfecfa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ad-cbf-cf-b-cfecfa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ad-cbf-cf-b-cfecfa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ad-cbf-cf-b-cfecfa_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKMore than one in three say they could rethink travel after pandemic – surveyMore than a third of people say they could rethink the way they travel after the coronavirus pandemic, a new survey suggests.VideoCoronavirusBelfast streets to be pedestrianised in green transformation planWork to pedestrianise Belfast#s Hill Street and Gordon Street in the Cathedral Quarter is to begin as part of a new green initiative.Most ReadExecutive to discuss easing lockdown as Economy Minister signals further retail reopeningTributes to Shane Lappin who died in accident while building new home in Co ArmaghBlack Lives Matter protesters in Northern Ireland prepared to fight fixed fines over rallies during coronavirus lockdownPubs, restaurants and shops in Northern Ireland can open on July  as coronavirus lockdown rules to be eased to save economyCouncil urged to rename Newry street called after nationalist who backed slave trade,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to build stamina rather than speed in the absence of race meetings.She said: “I have been training on trails and the road and the beach so it has been great to get back to the track.”The athlete was recovering from injury so the coronavirus restrictions actually gave her extra time to recuperate without worrying about missing events.She said her fellow competitors in countries like Australia had been able toto training much earlier and swimmers in Northern Ireland still faced dficulties – but added it was good to be back.Being at home more meant being closer to the fridge, but she said she had many years experience of being disciplined and keeping a good balanced diet.She runs around  miles a week in training.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland acc .ece

Aisling Quinn and Danielle Harkin from Carndonagh, both completed the Adult Learning University Access Diploma in Combined Studies at NWRC, which provides students who have been out of education, a pathway to Higher Education and University study. Aisling now works as a nurse at Buncrana Community Hospital, while younger sister Danielle is working overseas as a Cath Lab nurse in Australia. NWRC is currently accepting applications for the new college semester in September , and both sisters, who went on to study Nursing Degrees at the University of Ulster at Magee, said it was the perfect stepping stone to help themto education after a gap of several years, and go on to their dream careers. googletag.cmd.push Mum of three Aisling, who now lives in Malin, said she always wanted to be a nurse. She explained: “After school I did not feel ready to start my nursing journey and went on to do a pre-nursing course, but I always knew I wouldone day. As a mature student I researched courses to help me gain entry, and the Access Diploma in Combined Studies in NWRC kept popping up. After not studying for  years it was the perfect course to get me back into learning mode and prepare me for the Degree course I wished to pursue. googletag.cmd.push “The lecturers were very hands-on, helping in every way they could to ensure you performed to the best of your ability. The constructive feedback from peers and lecturers was particularly helpful. The course content allowed me to develop new skills and encouraged me to become more confident in myself academically. “Before completing the course I enrolled in the BSc Hons Nursing degree. One of the lecturers helped me through this process and ensured all relevant information was included in my application before being sent. I passed the interview and commenced the course in . In December  I graduated with a ’ honours degree, said Aisling. Aisling worked in Altnagelvin Hospital but last year moved closer to home and got a post in Buncrana Community Hospital. She added: I am thankful for the Diploma as it enabled me to pursue a career that I love. I would highly recommend this course to anyone seeking to further their education whatever path they are planning to take.” Little sister Danielle, who completed the Access Course a year before Aisling, is now working in Australia as a nurse. Danielle said: I decided to do the course as I thought it would be the perfect stepping stone to get into the nursing degree I desired. I did not get enough points from my Leaving Certicate so this was another path available that enabled me access. “The course was very good and I would highly recommend to others looking to pursue their career in Nursing or further their education in any way. As a mature student I found the course eased you back into doing assignments and got your brain working academically again. The tutors were very helpful and really wanted you to do your best. “I got into Magee nursing the same year I finished the access course. I would totally recommend this course to others and I have already recommended it to many of my friends in the past.” The Access Course in Combined Studies at North West Regional College offers an opportunity for students normally over  years of age, who have been out of full time education for at least one year, a chance toto study. NWRC offers Access Courses in Health and Welfare, Science, and Combined Studies, which are all validated by local universities.

Kerry keeper Shane Ryan managed to claw Paddy Smalls speculative shot from above the bar, before toe-poking to the safety of Stephen OBrien. The Kenmare man offloaded to David Moran, who in turn thumped a long ball down the Cusack Stand sideline. When defender Davy Byrne lost the flight of the ball, Tommy Walsh didnt need a second invitation. Killian Spillane burst purposefully through the middle. Walsh, only on the pitch two minutes, gave him the ball. Dublin had enough bodies to deal with it, but Spillane had other ideas. Fresh and fearless. With one feint of the shoulders, he was onto his left foot before burying to the net. Stephen Cluxton shouldve done better, but the Kerry mans low bolt unleashed a bottled emotion from five years of waiting. googletag.cmd.push In , he was the fulcrum of Jack OConnors attack as Kerry won a first minor All-Ireland in two decades. With - to his name and a natural ability to kick off both feet, he lit up that summers championship. In most other counties, he wouldve been straight into the senior team the following season. This was the year of the senior and double. How can we ever forget Kieran Donaghys retort at Joe Brollys statement of Kerrys demise. His family tradition would suggest that he was born to play for Kerry, but Spillane – son of four-time winner Tom - was going to have to wait. googletag.cmd.push Stephen OBrien, Johnny Buckley, Donnchadh Walsh, Paul Geaney, Donaghy and James ODonoghue held the senior jerseys. Darren OSullivan, Kieran OLeary, Declan OSullivan and Barry John Keane were all on the bench. When the squad was announced for the  Super s game with Donegal, Spillane was listed at number , but started the game. Peter Keanes secret weapon notched three points in a - apiece blockbuster. He had arrived and his All-Ireland final goal announced him as a Kerry star of the future. A marked man. On the Ring of Kerry, you will pass through Templenoe. Apart from the sign, you wont even know youve passed through it until you reach the nearby Kenmare. The clubs pitch, which produced Tom, Mick and Pat Spillane, hugs the bay. They supplied four players to the Kingdom squad for last years All-Ireland final - Gavin Crowley, Tadhg Morley, brothers Adrian and Killian Spillane. Almost a tenth of their , from a club that won an All-Ireland junior title. ANOTHER PATH In years between being a minor winner and Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice handing him a senior league debut, in , Killian played on the Kerry junior team. Jason Foley and Graham OSullivan, mainstays of the current defence, did the same. Conor Cox, now playing with Roscommon, used the junior grade as a step ladder to the next level of his career. It has a ruling that enforces a county to change their entire team after winning it, yet Kerry have still won it five times in a row. Its not the most prestigious title in the world, but its football and a shop window. The fact that Kerry are getting such a pull from the bottom rung, gives them such an advantage. Declan OSullivan hails from Dromoid Pearses. In Tyrone, you have Rock supplying Kieran Gourley when Tyrone were in their pomp. Galway goalkeeper and An Spideal man Maghnus Breatnach has played for the juniors, a grade that helped elevate his clubmate Antaine Oacute Laoiacute to Paacutedraic Joyces attention. Mayos Darren Coen was the same. Derry are nowhere close to getting this type of . In the last  seasons,  players have played league or championship. From John Brennans Ulster final season of  to the present day, none come from junior clubs. Goalkeeper Oran Hartin had two appearances and played junior championship for Limavady, but of the  seasons, they have played at intermediate level for six of them. Of the , only  hail from intermediate clubs. For the purposes of the study, the club is graded on the number of years playing at championship level in the last decade. It ranks Greenlough and Newbridge as senior, with Foreglen at intermediate. Enda Lynnhas represented Derry most during the window. Oisin Duffy, Niall Keenan and Neil Forester are the only intermediate players to exceed  outings, with Marty Donaghy taking his tally to  in the  qualier exit to Longford. In terms of championship action, nobody outside of the senior grade has played more than  times, though Niall Keenan is likely to be the first. A debate for another day is the lack of city players that have made the breakthrough. The total sits at three. Neil Forester and Eoghan Concannon, neither of whom are on Rory Gallaghers senior squad, are two. Ben McCarron is the third. Of around  boys in a year group at St Columbs, I remember Eamonn Burns saying that only around  had the basic skills by the time they entered the gates in first year. Some dont have clubs at all. Until that changes, it is dficult to see the city really giving Derry the support it needs to progress as a county. And there are people promoting Gaelic games in the city, who are as passionate as anywhere  in Ireland. There just arent enough. When I think of the joy in the face of Neil Forester after winning games with Derry minors and the sheer dejection after Castledawson beat Steelstown in the  intermediate final. Real emotion. If only there were more like him to drive the GAA message in the city. Back to the topic in question, getting players from minor to senior. The Derry conundrum. Rather than going around in circles, why not enter a team in the All-Ireland junior championship  Since there are no Ulster teams involved, it would take travel and money. And it would take time. Derry have been at the top of the charts in recent years, in terms of funding from Croke Park. Maybe it is time to filter some of that cash into the area that is failing most and leave underageto clubs and schools, who are continually churning out players. From chatting to a few people from non senior clubs, there could be an appetite for it. But it would need to be done properly. Not a half-arsed job. As a starting point, draw up a football development committee. Call a meeting, for all the captains and chairmen of Derrys intermediate and junior clubs and put out the feelers. Ask the hard questions. Why have players been overlooked  Leave it open to players who either have not made the U , or are too old for it. Take a look at the club manager circuit and approach someone to take it on. It wouldnt take up that much time, as players need to have access to their club. They have the first draw on the players after all. Essentially, it is a development squad for the seniors. What would it have not done for a Lee Moore, who was one of the best county minors in Ireland for two seasons  He wasnt ready to displace Paddy Bradley. Who was, Lee had all the qualities to have been his successor. A Paudie ONeill needs his class properly massaged into a county senior player. It is a long shot and it will be hard to sell. There will be plenty of obstacles. But isnt there always, in all walks of le. If it was easy, it would have been done already. In the last ten years, Neil Forester, Niall Keenan, Oisin Duffy, Eoghan Concannon, Marty Donaghy and Bliain Gormley are the six intermediate players, from the  who have worn an Oakleaf championship jersey, to have played in the championship for Derry from outside the senior ranks. Its not enough. Kerrys Shane Ryan and Killian Spillane dont play for senior clubs. They were county minors in , and five years later – in their senior debut season – they were on the front line, battling for Sam. ALSO READ - Be careful what you wish for. More...

The Derry senior football championship has reverted back to knock-out in recent seasons and with club leagues set to be phased out this year, it would only guarantee club players one competitive game. It is understood that a group concept is being explored, in two groups of eight or four groups of four, that would offer club players more games in a season that wont have the Derry champions progressing after the provincial and All-Ireland club championships have been taken out of the calendar. googletag.cmd.push At the start of the year, group formats were an option as listed on a draft document for the  season. It is also understood that only Owenbeg and Celtic Park will be used as venues for championship games. On the hurling front, Ulster champions Slaughtneil will not be able to defend their title. The Derry hurling championships had been successfully tied in with the league in recent seasons to give more games. Without a league, a draw will be needed for the championship. The County Derry Post contacted Derry GAA to seek clarication on any plans. “The CCC are due to meet later this week to finalise plans for the club championships within the  week window,” replied a spokesperson. googletag.cmd.push “Due to the extraordinary circumstances and the desire to provide a meaningful series of games, competition structures in hurling and football are likely to dfer from previous years.” RELATED - Derry clubs to be given notice ofto action.

The Derry senior football championship has reverted back to knock-out in recent seasons and with club leagues set to be phased out this year, it would only guarantee club players one competitive game.

The plan was to bring entertainment to the war weary inhabitants of the town.This meeting would lead to the formation of St Patrickrsquos Operatic and Pantomime Society and their first production was Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter mdash a title that has dated somewhat.The public responded by volunteering as actors, stage hands, working with costumes and music.Principals and chorus rehearsed separately. Only one week before opening night did they merge, coming together for the first time on the stage of St Patrickrsquos Hall.It was advertised as lsquoA Feast of Music, Song and Dancersquo boasting  voices. Rehearsal took place in the McLean home, the cast rehearsed upstairs, while machinists and costumiers worked downstairs.Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter was performed on Sunday, May , and Monday, May , .It proved successful enough to be followed in  by other productions such as Tangles, The Enchanted Rose and Quest of Olwen.The performances, in the absence of film footage and photographs, appear to be lost in the haze of time.Tangles, described as a grand musical comedy, was performed in St Patrickrsquos Hall on Monday, June , the night before the Normandy Landings. The performance was in aid of the Down County Infirmary.The programme included cast and production notes. The actors, credited as lsquoMortalsrsquo included Michael Tomelty as Lollipop, Sally King as Princess Pansy, Lillian Lundy as Dame Mouldy, Leslie Rice as Lord Humbug and Master Michael Rea as the Inn Keeperrsquos Son. lsquoImmortalsrsquo included Peggy Halloran as Titania, Maura Blaney as Nona and Mary Gilmore as lsquoCinderellarsquo.Also included was an array of guardsmen, a chorus of fairies, village chorus, court dancers, innkeeper chorus, fairy partners, bunnies and a chorus of gnomes, who included Maureen Dorrian, Annie Murphy and June Doyle. In all, the cast numbered .The scenic artist was Mr James Maguire and the costume designer was Mrs OrsquoKelly. In charge of actors make-up were Mrs Maguire, Kathleen Branf and Mrs Gilmore.But, what was the story  With appearances from gnomes and Cinderella it may have had a little to do with fairyland.Is there anyone out there who remembers  At this distance, it is just a forgotten show, one of many that enter-tained people at a most dficult time in history.Around Lecale and where, there were a number of amateur dramatic companies, many more than today, who performed many shows. Here are but a sample.Old King Cole by May King, with nine scenes and a chorus of , was a three-hour show, staged in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, at pm on Sunday, February , .Reserved tickets were on sale from Mr Breen, Mr Fox and Mr Doris.Ballykilbeg Dramatic Society gave the public a production of Paul Twyning by George Shiels on Sunday, March , and Tuesday, March , , with a repeat performance in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, the following Sunday.Kilclief Parish Amateur Dramatic Club staged Shielsrsquo new comedy, The Fort Field, in St Malachyrsquos Hall in the village on Sunday, May , . They also performed it in the Stella Maris Hall in Strangford the following Friday.Killyleagh Dramatic Society presented St John Ervinersquos lsquoBoydrsquos Shop at the Belfast Dramatic Festival during the first week of September , having staged it during the late summer of that year in Strangford.On the night of Sunday, November , , you could treat yourself to Stars over Ballynoe, an all-star iety concert in St Patrickrsquos Parochial Hall, Ballynoe, with Alister Dick, the famous Irish tenor, Alfie Donnelly, Irelandrsquos funniest comedian, the Legamaddy Dancers and the Portaferry Hawaiian Band. The compere was Joseph Caher.Woodgrange Platoon Home Guard presented The Lilac Ribbon by Downpatrick born playwright Lynn Doyle in the Woodgrange Orange Hall on Friday, January , .The Whip Hand was performed by the Stella Maris Players in the Parochial Hall, Saul, on Sunday, May , .The Bryansford Players staged The Rale True Doctor and Professor Tim in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Bryansford, on Sunday, April , , and in St Maryrsquos Hall, Newcastle, on Sunday and Monday, April  and .The Pikemen Orsquo the Ards, described as ldquothe grand Irish drama in five acts, was presented in Dunsford Hall on Sunday, April , , by the Cruachan Cowey Dramatic Club, with Irish selections by the Silver Star Band, Portaferry.With television, the internet and computer games there appears to be less interest today in local drama groups.

Hopefully, therersquos more to come, he said.Joersquos latest work is QUINN - No Place to Hide, a standalone follow-up to a successful launch of the first in the series. The title is dedicated to his great grandfather, Sam Quinn, a man Joe admired for the way in which he dealt with the harshness of le in Downpatrick at the turn of the twentieth century.ldquoHe worked -hour shts, six days a week, as a yard foreman at the Rearsquos bottling plant in Market Street, Downpatrick. It was backbreaking work for which he earned a pittance to feed a large family. He never complained, never took a holiday, and never ventured outside the confines of the town. He lived through two world wars, the creation of the Irish Republic, and countless other momentous times, yet he kept his head down and simply got on with his own le.Joe is quick to point out that the character in his latest book is nothing like his ancestor. ldquoAll Irsquove taken is his name. My version of Quinn is that of an international assassin who leaves Downpatrick to join the Irish Rangers and later becomes a gun for hire in America. Talk about two dferent worlds! Perhaps though, therersquos a bit of parallel in that I transferred old Sam Quinnrsquos stoicism and relentless nature into a make-believe cut-out who lives his le by those very ideals.With a -year background in journalism, it was hardly surprising that Joe wanted to keep writing when he switched careers in  to head up Down Business Centre, a support enterprise agency to help promote start-up businesses.He said: ldquoI loved the interaction with local entrepreneurs, but the writing bug doesnrsquot go away. I had always an idea for a book and couldnrsquot stop scratching the itch. After a few years, I decided to put it into action.That first book mdash SOMEONE HAS TO PAY mdash was a product of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It is set in the unlikely surroundings of Bishopscourt, a former RAF base just outside Downpatrick, and features a British government elite squad assembled under the relative anonymity of the old complex for the purposes of waging a final shoot-to-kill war against the IRA.Joersquos own assessment of the story brings a wry smile. ldquoItrsquos a far-fetched idea, isnrsquot it  It couldnrsquot have happened, could it  Thatrsquos the essence of the storyteller and I guess itrsquos why I love doing it.A recurring theme in Joersquos books is that he likes toin a mention of his hometown whenever possible. Yoursquoll find Downpatrick cropping up a lot in background narratives, or as the setting for a few hair-raising episodes that attempt to weave their way into the history and fabric of the area.ldquoItrsquos just something I like to do. Irsquom a Downpatrick man and I have the urge to shout about it when the chance arises. Wersquove a lot going for us in this area and it can only do good to let the world know wersquore here.One of his other books SPENT FORCE, which was a crime thriller set in the West of Ireland and featured a fading Garda detective, attracted praise from two signicant sources. One was Ken Bruen, the international bestselling author of the Jack Taylor Irish crime series, who wrote: ldquoSometimes a book comes along that you instantly know......damn, I am now going to have to read this all over again for the sheer joy of the narrative. It means that I will have to swear off other books for a time as very few can provide the utter joy and delight of Joe McCoubreyrsquos superb novel.Another unexpected source was a serving Garda sergeant who posted a glowing review on the Amazon . ldquoA top-class novel which deserves high praise. I am from Irish law enforcement and this novel is as close to a real-le investigation as you can get. Gripping from start to finish, totally believable characters, strong storyline, Highly Recommended.Joe admits he was floored by the feedback. ldquoOn the one hand there was an endorsement by perhaps Irelandrsquos foremost crime thriller author, while on the other there was vindication from a policeman that the research and effort to get things right had paid off. Itrsquos what any author craves, and itrsquos what makes you want to get back over the keyboard and start into the next adventure.That next adventure is taking Joe back to the West of Ireland to team up again with his favourite Garda detective. The sequel is provisionally titled FORCE OF NATURE which delves into the murky world of a serial killer. Not surprisingly, Downpatrick features heavily again.ldquoYes, the killerrsquos first three victims are young girls from Downpatrick. The story will move from here to Westport and back again. Irsquom still not sure how it will end, and thatrsquos as much an appeal to me as it is to the reader.Joe explains that hersquos not a dedicated story plotter. ldquoI use a broad brush. I get an idea and just run with it. I donrsquot like to be confined to structure from start to finish, with the result that Irsquom not quite sure where Irsquom going from one chapter to another. I think of it as being spontaneous, which means I usually go off on tangents that keeps things fresh and moving along. Itrsquos a seat-of-the-pants alternative to being a plotter.Joe publishes all his books under his own publishing house, Inishfree Communications, which also offers support to local writers. To date, he has helped eight others to complete their author journey ndash between them they have published more than  titles. He provides proofing, formatting, and design services, including suggestions on the most effective covers for inidual books.ldquoItrsquos a big part of what I do these days, says Joe. ldquoThere are lots of budding writers and independent authors out there who just need a bit of extra help and encouragement to bring their work in front of the masses. I get as much of a kick out of seeing these books go on sale as I do from my own works.Joe McCoubreyrsquos books are available as paperbacks or eBooks on the Amazon and Barnes  Noble s..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Call for hedge removal after near miss  ","story":"AN overgrown hedge close to a BT exchange in Killyleagh is being blamed for a near miss involving a pedestrian and a bus last week.A woman who was forced to step on to the main road to avoid the hedge was almost struck by the vehicle as it passed, leaving both her and the driver shaken.BT has confirmed that it plans to cut the hedge this week, but local councillor Billy Walker said the telecoms giant must go further and remove it completely.He said there was a wall behind the hedge, suggesting that once the hedge is removed, BT would only have to build a small fence on top of it to secure its base.ldquoThe overgrown hedge has been an issue for many years and there have been countless near misses involving people who have had to step off the footpath to pass, including mums with prams. What happened last Friday is the final straw as far as I am concerned, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe only sensible solution is to remove the hedge in its entirety. To do so would not cost a lot of money, but would save lives as at this time of year as people would not have to walk on a busy main road to pass.Cllr Walker says he has raised the issue with the telecoms company over the years, but was told the hedge could not be cut back as it was the nesting season.ldquoMy biggest fear has always been that someone could end up getting killed or seriously injured at this part of Killyleagh. While I am thankful the woman who stepped off the footpath last Friday was not seriously injured, this must be the last incident of this kind, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI am appealing to BT to do the decent thing and finally remove the hedge. We have been fortunate up until now no one has been injured, but I shudder to think what could happen at this location.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThis situation is a major accident waiting to happen, but it can be avoided by simply removing a hedge. It is s no brainer and I hope BT will agree to my request.A BT spokesperson said the organisation was sorry to learn of the distress that the hedge may have caused and would be in contact with Cllr Walker directly.ldquoThe hedge is scheduled to be trimmed back this week.

The centre is also coordinating the creation of a VisitDownpatrick website, he remarked.Dr Campbell said St Patrick provided a ldquounique selling point for our area and and an overall brand.He added: ldquoAs this is potentially a year of two winters, we have asked the council to revert to their  contributions to the centre to help us survive and be able to change direction.ldquoThis means giving the centre a little more, particularly because as a small charity in a big building we have not been able to get any of the funding from government made available to other groups and organisations.ldquoIf tourism, as the most important part of our economy in mid Down is to not just survive but thrive we need to be armed with not just a shield, but a sword to fight this battle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Climbing to top of Mount Everest  ","story":"MOUNT Everest, , feet, or , metres, of awe-inspiring, dficult, adventurous, dangerous climbing. Some people have looked at Everest and thought climbing it is necessary. Others call those people crazy.Everesting is described as ldquofiendishly simple, yet brutally hard. Ride hill repeats on any hill anywhere in the world mdash or on Zwt, the virtual cycling simulator mdash in a single activity until you climb the equivalent height of Mount Everest.The concept was created by Hells , who also control the induction into the Everesting Hall of Fame. Website Everesting.cc contains the rules to follow.Well, call me crazy, but I did it. No, I didnrsquot fly to Nepal and climb the actual mountain. Irsquom not a former pro athlete or extraordinarily gted human, nor am I an adventure adrenaline junkie looking for a fix. Irsquom just a  something mdash  to be precise mdash son of God who has a family, a job, a dog, a bicycle, and I landed myself in the Everesting Hall of Fame. And you can too.I decided to use the challenge to help raise funds for mental health organisations Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Service, or The Hub, as itrsquos known locally. My initial target was pound but I was astounded and humbled by the generosity of people. In the end donations totalled pound,.I chose to start at am so I could have family support at the finish. Despite the early start I was joined by my we, Jennie, and through the day she was a great support, bringing me fresh drinks and relaying messages of support.I turned on my favourite music playlist and hit the hill with a measured effort that I thought I could sustain for hours. I planned a bidon of sports drink for each ascent, as well as -g carbs per hour. Real foods early in the ride and gels and sugary drinks for later in the ride.The first three or four ascents felt strangely comfortable, averaging  minutes up each time. I was almost an hour ahead of my estimated -hour schedule by midday. I later noticed some friends,, who were tracking my progress, were saying how strong I was riding and hoped that I wouldnrsquot pay for it later.They were right! Ascents six and seven were so tough, even to the point where I felt physically ill, and my times were now over  minutes per climb.vEveresters add the tag lsquovEverestingrsquo to their Zwt profile name which means anyone on the course that sees it knows you are vEveresting and many will ride with you, congratulate you, give you a thumbs up, or just encourage you to keep going.These wonderful sherpas made it a much more enjoyable experience, especially during the sixth and seventh ascents when it was dficult to want to keep riding and my butt was telling me that I was crazy to push on.Despite wanting to reach the finish as soon as possible, I had to listen to my body, and so I stopped for some food and a bit of a rest. Another quick shower, kit change and application of chamois cream, and I was ready to continue.I was joined online this time by good friends Nathan Mullan and Stephen Hanna, both from Dromara Cycling Club, and Sam Carmichael and Nigel Bradley, from my old club, Northwest CC. Seeing them there gave me a real boost and that combined with knowing I had the end in sight really spurred me on to the finish.The final  metres of climbing were the best - I was getting messages of encouragement from Zwters from places as far away as Germany, USA and Colombia. I finished shortly after pm, over  hours after I first leapt into the saddle and boy did I sleep well that night.So to finish, Irsquod like to say a huge thanks to everyone for their support, to those who donated in such hard times mdash Irsquom so grateful and Irsquom hopeful we will make le that little bit easier for others.I havenrsquot put any thought into the next challenge mdash on Sunday I said never again mdash but the beauty of cycling is therersquos always the next time.

Thatrsquos something our whole extended family embraces.ldquoItrsquos going to be bittersweet but we are happy for Mary and the lovely couple who are adopting her. Itrsquos good to know that she will be going to her forever home and will have a lovely little le. Thatrsquos always the ultimate aim for a child, particularly a younger child.ldquoHowever, one of the challenges is trying to teach her about adoption. How do you teach a three year-old that she will be leaving us and going to a forever family  We had to be creative and came up with the idea about the Christmas elf. Like many houses, we had Bauble the elf at Christmas, who was then lsquoadoptedrsquo by Mary and now lives with us all year round and is part of our family. We even made an adoption certicate to show her it was real.ldquoWhile Covid- has put a hold on this for now, we still have to prepare both Mary and ourselves, as it will be hard to say goodbye. But, as our daughter keeps saying, itrsquos part of foster care and what is right for Mary.ldquoEveryone has been writing their goodbye letters to her.

They do respite fostering ndash temporary childcare for another fosterer or family ndash and short-term foster care.Itrsquos something that the couple have wanted to do for a long time.ldquoI wanted to foster for as long as in my early twenties and my husband felt the same, said  year-old Tanya. ldquoWe both came from family backgrounds where close relatives were in the caring professions.ldquoWe were very united in knowing that we would foster one day, even from the day we were married. However, when our daughter Hannah came along, we wanted her to be part of it, obviously, and to wait until the time that we were sure she understood the impact of it.ldquoWe waited until she was about  before we contacted the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. Thatrsquos where our journey started, and we havenrsquot looked back once. The Trust has been with us every step of the way. The only regret we have had about fostering is not doing it sooner.The Dicksons have also been supported by their nearest and dearest in doing something that many other people consider doing.ldquoWe were lucky that our families were always on board with us regarding our fostering, Tanya said. Our employers have been amazing, our church family and even the village family of Crossgar. Everyone has really embraced our fostering journey.After making contact with the Trust Tanya, who works at Kilmood Early Years Playgroup, said that after a period of assessment and training they began to foster six months later.ldquoI think the assessment can put people off, but I believe itrsquos an invaluable tool as you come out of it knowing yourself better, she explained. You know your own personal qualities better and your skill base.ldquoItrsquos also essential as it helps the Trust match children with dferent needs with dferent foster carers. The only thing we stipulated is that any child we cared for would be at least two years younger than Hannah as we wanted her to be the eldest child in the house.Hannah, who is a student of Saintfield High School, has been integral to the couplersquos success as foster parents and has relished her role as lsquobig sisterrsquo.Mrs Dickson said: ldquoHannah has been so great with the children. With Hannah maturing, she is showing her experience of fostering in a very positive and beautul way by showing empathy to others.ldquoThatrsquos something she would never have experienced had we not fostered and she feels more grateful for her family le. She wants to be a nurse and I can see that great caring spirit being fostered in her care of Mary. Itrsquos been so rewarding and has changed us completely for the better.Unlike many first-time parents, Tanya said foster parents always have help and support available.She said: ldquoEvery child that comes through our door is dferent and you adapt accordingly for whatever that child needs. We have the support of a link worker, who has had a lot of training. Yoursquore never on your own.ldquoWe have learnt to take things at a childrsquos pace. Some children who have been looked after before are used to being more independent and self-sufficient. You have to walk a fine line at the beginning with each child to know what they want you to do for them.The Dicksons hope to continue fostering for as long as possible and to do their best for any child that comes their way.ldquoCaring for a toddler has kept us young. You are on the ball from the crack of dawn until bedtime. I would like to think we could continue fostering for as long as we want as therersquos no age limit to fostering, she added.If you are interested in becoming a foster carer, like Tanya, or just want to find out more about what is involved, visit the HSC Northern Ireland Adoption and Foster Care website or call    to find out more.* Maryrsquos name has been changed to protect her identity..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Dean pops the question at open air gig  ","story":"A KILMORE man enlisted the help of local musician Eddie Booth when he got down on one knee to propose to his girlfriend recently.Dean Campbelland his girlfriend of ten years Laura Walters, have been big fans of Eddiersquos lsquoLive at the Lamplightrsquo gigs which he performs from his garden in Kilmore each Saturday night during the Covid- lockdown.However, unbeknown to Laura, who is a care worker for the NHS, Saturday, May , was about to become the most memorable of them all.Dean, who works for a local quarry company, says keeping the proposal a secret from Laura was the hardest thing he ever had to do.ldquoI had spoken with Laurarsquos parents, who live in England, to let them know what I was planning and arranged for them to be tuning into Eddiersquos gig via Zoom, he said.While Laura, who is also , was excited about seeing her family, she remained oblivious to the fact Eddie, was in on the delightful conspiracy.ldquoTherersquos just so much sad news around at the moment, I thought it would be a wee morale boost for the community to pop the question, so I approached Eddie to ask for his help.

Republicans are already planning a memorial on council property in Castlewellan and it is believed that loyalists in Ballynahinch may erect a memorial to dead UVF terrorists on council land at Langley Road.KILLYLEAGH ndash A new community forum, to represent the interests of a wide range of groups in the Killyleagh area, is to be set up.The umbrella organisation will represent what has been described as the ldquoimpressive level of community activity in the area.The idea to create the new group was floated at last weekrsquos annual meeting of the Killyleagh, Shrigley and District Town Committee by secretary Peter Bryson.He said the new group is vital to enable better communication and planning and help with the compilation of joint funding applications to a range of funders.He said the creation of the new group could provide the perfect  on which to develop partnerships of shared interest in the Killyleagh area.SAINTFIELD mdash As the controversy over the dangers of mobile telephone equipment continues, Saintfield residents have found themselves at the centre of the most recent debate.Parents and councillors met in the local library last week to discuss their fears of two telecommunications masts at Comber Road, which they believe are casting a shadow over the local high school.The public meeting was called by mother-of-three Laura Bill in the wake of the independent Stewart report which advises parents not to allow their children to use mobile phones, and pointed to children as being most likely to be affected by possible health risks.Leukaemia is one illness which reports have suggested could be caused, or aggravated by, radiation from mobile phone masts.One woman told Thursdayrsquos meeting that a pocket of seven children under  years of age suffer from childhood leukaemia in the Saintfield area, leading to parental fears that this could be aggravated by the existence of the masts.BALLYGOWAN mdash A shooting incident in Ballygowan during the early hours of Monday is being linked to a paramilitary feud.The house at Comber Road was sprayed with automatic gunfire by four men who smashed a number of windows. One of the weapons police believe was used in the attack was an AK  assault rle.No one was injured during the incident which is being linked to an ongoing feud between the LVF and UVF.A police spokesman confirmed yesterday the gunment made off in a white-coloured Ford Mondeo car which had a taxi sign on the roof.The vehicle drove off along the Comber Road in the village and into Comber where it was abandoned and set on fire at the rear of the Leisure Centre.Detectives investigating the incident have issued an appeal for information and want to hear from anyone who may have seen people acting suspiciously in the vicinity of the house at Ballygowan to contact them.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Members of Edengrove Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch have said farewell to the Rev Trevor Steele, who is taking up a new appointment in Ohio.Last Sunday morning, Mr Steele and his family were presented with a number of gts by the congregation to thank them for their service and contribution to the le of the church.Along with his we Carol and children Andrew and Joanna, Mr Steele is moving to the United States after accepted a call to McCord Road Congregational Church in Toledo where he begins his ministry next month.Mr Steele has been in Ballynahinch for the past five years after accepting a call to join the congregation at Edengrove while he was assistant minister at Carrickfergus Presbyterian Church.GAA mdash Peter McGrathrsquos job as Down football manager is safe, for the time being.

adjacent empty buildings and a Newry, Mourne and Down Council-owned car park met to discuss a new brochure which has been designed for the near two acre site.While it was suggested that the coronavirus pandemic is likely to delay the redevelopment of the huge site, traders and politicians are keen to see work starting on the eagerly-awaited economic regeneration of this historic part of the town.The local council and the Department for Communities are spearheading an ambitious regeneration project with the new brochure mdash understood to be still in draft form ndash designed to provide potential developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquospotential and secure expressions of interest.A number of Irish Street businesses have already invested in upgrading their respective shop fronts while the former police base was recently given a fresh coat of paint as part of a revitalisation scheme.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the pubic virtually.Described as a strategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential.While the imposing former police station enjoys protected status and cannot be razed to the ground, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come with an imaginative plan for the building.It has been identied as a development opportunity site in the Down Area Plan, with the area to the front included in Downpatrickrsquos conservation area.While it has been suggested that housing could form part of any redevelopment proposal, the building has been touted as a potential base for offices.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.They are keen to retain Irish Streetrsquos uniqueness where residents and traders live and work alongside each other and ensure that there is adequate parking. There have already been suggestions that an underground parking facility at the current Irish Street car park would allow retail units to be built on top.Work was recently completed on a protracted public realm scheme in Irish Street and it is hoped that the redevelopment of the former police base will complement this project, which resulted in the provision of new granite paving, street furniture and lighting.Downpatrick councillors are keen to see the redevelopment proposal increase the number of shoppers to the town to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the townrsquos economy for many years.It is also hoped to regenerate the town centrersquos night time economy with politicians eager for the Irish Street scheme to create a number of much-needed new jobs.Earlier this year, a number of Downpatrick councillors were given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear.Local council officials say they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site and had been planning to meet with them to discuss the way forward prior to the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, the local authority aims to work alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have previously expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre. However, it remains to be seenthat interest remains given the current economic climate.Downpatrick councillors say that they recognise the Irish Street regeneration project provides an opportunity to regenerate the town centre and provide a boost for existing businesses and hope that the project can be progressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Minister asked to give assurances on bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been asked to make it clear that delivering Ballynahinchrsquos multi-million pound bypass remains one of her key priorities.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former minister at the Department of Infrastructure mdash who is keen to see work starting on the poundm project.When he was at the helm of the Stormont department, Mr Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December .Since then, there has been major progress to deliver the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The bypass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with major new roundabouts proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Mr Hazzard said while the coronavirus pandemic has consumed much time for all government departments, he does want to diminish Ms Mallonrsquos role in working constructively with her executive colleagues in mitigating the worst effects of the global emergency.But he said since that taking over the reins at the roads department five months ago, the minister has issued statements on electric bikes and hydrogen buses and what he described as ldquoplenty of positive soundings on other capital projects, but there hasnrsquot been a single word on the long overdue Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready. Yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead since taking office in January, said Mr Hazzard.ldquoIt is unsurprising then that local businesses and commuters are beginning to question the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to deliver this scheme.The MP says he has once again asked Ms Mallon to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department and set out a timeline for commencing construction.He added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the successful delivery of this project will be a vital step in improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our local community in these dficult times.In a letter to Ms Mallon, the South Down MP said the bypass scheme is at an advanced stage and is as close to ldquoshovel ready as any other project in the government departmentrsquorsquos capital programme.He has asked the ministerthe Ballynahinch scheme remains a ldquopriority capital project, what stage is it currently at and when will construction work be signed off Responding to Mr Hazzard, a spokesman for the roads minister said that while she is currently faced with ldquoserious and challenging budget constraints, she has already stated that she is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for communities and improve lives across the North.ldquoShe very much recognises that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch, the spokesman continued.ldquoIn finalising budget decisions, the minister is focused on addressing the need to fund essential infrastructure work, promoting a green recovery and getting other strategic projects underway.The spokesman said that in particular, Ms Mallon is considering her long term priorities for strategic road improvement schemes and how they might facilitate complementary improvements to promote sustainable travel choices, connecting people and communities, creating thriving and liveable places that enhance opportunities and our economy.The spokesman added: ldquoThe minister understands the frustration among the people of South Down at the failure of previous administrations to deliver important projects.ldquoShe has already set out her ambition to address regional imbalance with the delivery of projects and hopes elected representatives from across all parties and across the Executive will support her in securing the money to deliver strategic projects which improve both our economy and the wellbeing of our local communities in South Down and across the North in these dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"National Trust sites reopen  ","story":"A NUMBER of local National Trust properties reopen from today.The National Trust has confirmed that Saintfieldrsquos stunning Rowallane Garden and Castle Ward and Mount Stewart mdash both on the shores of Strangford Lough mdash will be welcoming visitors after being closed for a number of weeks as part of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.In total,  properties are reopening across the province, with Trust officials confirming that advance bookings will be required in order to limit numbers and maintain public safety.

Funding opportunities are being explored and while this work will also have been interrupted, I hope that it will resume in the near future.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one offering and

They decided they would do a Zoom competition instead and we thought it would be great to enter some of our teams in a way to keep spirits high, keep training, keep motivated and most importantly - have some fun.“We have been doing weekly Zoom rehearsals every Tuesday with the mini, junior and intermediate competition teams, which has been amazing. I have been brought to tears on many occasions by seeing their beautul, smiling faces that I miss so much.“As the restrictions started to relax - where you could meet six people outdoors - some of the dancers have started to meet up outside for their Tuesday Zoom classes, which has been really special for them. I still haven’t seen any of them in person yet but am very excited to.”Victoria revealed that a productive collaboration with Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council and the Riverside Theatre was key to making the event happen.The Ulster Dance Championships Zoom competition will feature Victoria Lagan dancers on Friday“I spoke to a member of the Council during a weekly FaceTime meeting I have with them regarding re-opening the studio and discussed the idea of us being able to do our Zoom competition together outdoors and they went through some of the legalities around it,” she said.“Once I realised this could be an option I contacted Roseanne Sturgeon, Manager of the Riverside Theatre, who was over the moon with the idea. She then had Megan Sheeran, who is the Technical Coordinator at the Riverside, to contact me to go through possibilities.“Megan has been such a huge help with this and has really gone above and beyond the call of duty in helping me do all the risk assessments so we could put it forward to be approved by Ulster University, Coleraine.“Thank goodness the Uni said yes! So we will be meeting on Friday outside at the back of Riverside - weather permitting - to compete in the Ulster Dance Championships via Zoom.”Victoria Lagan dancers will perform live on Zoom on FridayDancers and parents will have to adhere to a number of strict regulations to make sure the event passes off safely.Each dancer must use personal hand santisers, bring their own labelled water bottle, practice social distancing and have no physical contact at any time with other competitors or equipment.There will be security on site to check names of the children participating and only one parent per child will be allowed to spectate.First aid and fire marsahals will also be present and there will also be a special isolation room in the theatre should anyone develop symptoms.Markings on the grass outside the theatre will assist social distancing and no toilets will be in operation.Victoria added that anyone ignoring the safety measures will be asked to leave the site immediately.“It’s a lot of rules and regulations but we are eager to follow them and make this work so that we can give these kids a great day,” she added.“Our dancers are known for being well disciplined and I have the utmost faith that they will follow all regulations. Dancing means the world to these girls and I know how grateful they are to everyone at Riverside for allowing them to perform.“It’s going to be an amazing day! I know I will be bawling my eyes out start to finish watching them dance.“I am so proud of each and every one of them for putting % effort into their craft especially during these dficult times.”Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id
