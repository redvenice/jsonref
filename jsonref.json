She was only 16 and working as a £3.60-an-hour supermarket checkout girl in her native Cockermouth, Cumbria, when in 2003 she became an overnight millionaire after scooping £1.8 million.She promptly left her job, gave £500,000 to friends and family, and splurged the rest on three surgical breast enhancements, lavish parties and £300,000 of designer clothes. Ten years on, the now mother of four had just a few thousand left.Last year, she was reported to be claiming Universal Credit.Since her win, the age limit for players has been increased to 18.Further controversy came in 2004, when Iorworth Hoare won £7.2 million despite serving a life sentence for attempted rape.Jailed in 1989 and released on licence in 2005, he had bought the ticket on weekend leave from prison, and his win was met with public outcry. Four years later, his victim Shirley Woodman, who subsequently waived her anonymity, successfully fought to change the law so she could sue him for damages despite the time allowed for a claim expiring.Hoare last hit the headlines in 2016 when he was fined after resisting arrest when police came to his home in Northumberland to investigate an allegation of flashing.And who can forget ‘Lotto Lout’ Michael Carroll, a former binman who squandered his 2002 £9.7 million win on a Norfolk mansion, whose garden he turned into a 24-hour racetrack, as well as spending millions on cocaine, gambling and prostitutes?He appeared in court more than 30 times after his win, but is now living a more peaceful life in Scotland where he was last reported to be working as a coalman.SPARE A THOUGHTIn 2001, Martyn and Kay Tott, from Watford, were dubbed ‘Britain’s unluckiest couple’ after missing out on a £3 million jackpot. It took the pair, who played the same numbers every week, six months to realise they had scooped the prize after they spotted an appeal for the winner to come forward (you have 180 days to claim winnings), only to realise simultaneously they had lost the ticket.Computer records at their local store proved they were telling the truth — but after informing Camelot, the couple discovered they had fallen victim to a little-known rule stating that lost tickets must be reported within 30 days.Even the support of public figures including Sir Richard Branson and Tony Blair was not enough to persuade Camelot to change the rules, and without the actual winning ticket, the Totts were unable to collect a single penny.The couple’s marriage later broke down, although Martyn eventually explained that, after being initially tortured by his failed win, he had reconciled himself to what had happened.‘There is no guarantee it would have brought me happiness,’ he told The Mail on Sunday."},{"url":null,"title":"Secrets Victoria Line station tiled mural","story":"Share this articleLondon Underground: The one thing that every station on the Victoria line has that you\u0027ve probably never noticed - MyLondon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71d08c9c9216caa0621be2ec3fa6977c94bda225/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f84ceaebb3f689db900240c4732322ce","title":"bank of england interest rates inflation oil markets sterling russia bond payments business live","story":"The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates back to its pre-pandemic levels today as it tries to dampen the UK’s inflationary surge.

It points out that while Russia and Ukraine contribute relatively small amounts to global output, they were big producers and exporters of key food items, minerals and energy. The OECD also warned that energy and food price rises are hitting the poor the hardest, and suggested governments could use windfall taxes to finance support. Seperately, Russia’s finance ministry said today its order to pay the $117m interest payment had been fulfilled, and it will update the market separately on whether the payment was deposited into the account of payment agent Citibank.

In a sign of inflationary pressures, Ocado Retail told shareholders that the grocery sector has seen “significant increases” in the costs of raw materials and products in the last quarter, alongside energy, utilities and dry ice. In response, it has lifted some retail prices where costs couldn’t be mitigated ‘in line with the rest of the market’. Looking ahead, Ocado warned that it is hard to predict the scale of food price inflation over the course of this year, with the Ukraine war increasing the uncertainty.

As it transpired, however, 5mm on Tuesday, which only went on to the quickest parts of the track, was neither here nor there, and Nicky Henderson, who would have been bitterly disappointed to see Shishkin run no sort of race in the Champion Chase, was among those to make that point. It was a reminder that forecasts, even just a few hours out, are no more than educated guesses based on the best information to hand, and also that the clerk’s job is bordering on impossible at times.  Despite today’s sunshine, the ground is inevitably to be testing later on. “Following the 21mm of rain that we had yesterday,” Pullin said in his early-morning briefing, “the ground on the New course, which we switch to today, has been updated to soft, heavy in places. The forecast for today is dry, bright this morning, clouding over later with temperatures around 13C.” The third day of the meeting is generally the weakest in terms of quality, but it has provided some memorable moments in the past, not least when Bryony Frost and Frodon took the Ryanair Chase three years ago and Paisley Park landed the Stayers’ Hurdle 40 minutes later.  Paisley Park has been the beaten favourite in the last two runnings of the Stayers’ and his powers appeared to be slightly on the wane before he bounced back to winning form for the first time since December 2020 in the Cleeve Hurdle in January. Andrew Gemmell, his devoted owner, has been blind since birth and missed his latest win as he was undergoing a heart operation at the time. He is certain to be back on track today and Paisley Park would be a hugely popular winner.  He faces strong Irish opposition though, including Flooring Porter, the defending champion, and there is a real possibility that the Irish could go through the whole card at Cheltenham today for the first time. St Patrick’s Day would be the ideal afternoon for it too, and there’s no doubt that they will get at least the first race on the board as all four runners are from across the water.  The action is under way at 1.30pm, picks for all seven races are here should you be so inclined, and you can follow the whole day as it unfolds here, so keep hittin’ refresh y’all.

Photograph: Erin Scott-PoolGetty Taoiseach Micheál Martin has tested positive for Covid -19, leading to the cancellation of his St Patrick’s Day face-to-face meeting with US president Joe Biden at the White House. Officials said on Wednesday night that they hoped the meeting would go ahead virtually, but the plans for the Taoiseach’s St Patrick’s Day programme were thrown into chaos by the news.Mr Martin was attending the Ireland Funds dinner in the National Building Museum in Washington on Wednesday night, part of a programme of events in the US capital this week, when he received the news. Before the news about the Taoiseach’s positive test, the event was addressed by Mr Biden, who received a rapturous reception from the 700 guests.The dinner, held every year on the eve of the Taoiseach’s visit to the Oval Office to meet the US president, is a major event in the Irish-American political calendar.In his speech, Mr Biden praised Mr Martin and paid tribute to the links between Ireland and the US, drawing heavily on the experience of his own family. The White House said Mr Biden’s speech ended at 7.54pm and he immediately left the podium. His motorcade left the venue four minutes later. He arrived at the venue at 7.10pm, officials said.Irish ambassador Dan Mulhall told guests at the dinner that Mr Martin had tested positive in a precautionary PCR test earlier, after a member of the wider Irish delegation visiting Washington had tested positive on routine antigen test.The White House insists that anyone visiting must undergo Covid-19 tests, with all visitors screened the day before they are scheduled to attend.Feeling well The first indication that something was amiss regarding the Taoiseach came as the Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi was finishing a speech. During her address, she welcomed the British ambassador to the event but warned her and the British government that if the border “hardened”, there would be no US-UK trade deal.Ms Pelosi had been scheduled to make an award to Mr Martin. Towards the end of her speech, she appeared to say that Mr Martin was on a call with European leaders. The Taoiseach had earlier been sitting next to Ms Pelosi. Mr Mulhall then took the stage. He said Mr Martin had tested positive for Covid -19 but was feeling well. Mr Martin, his officials who formed part of his delegation visiting Washington this week as well as travelling and resident journalists had to be tested. Shamrock ceremonyAhead of the St Patrick’s Day visit to the White House on Thursday, the Covid-19 testing was carried out on Wednesday afternoon and early evening. The Taoiseach tested negative after undergoing an antigen test. However, one of his colleagues in the delegation tested positive, and he took a precautionary PCR test, which also proved positive.Mr Martin then underwent a precautionary PCR test. The White House indicated that Mr Biden was not considered a close contact. However, the planned meeting with Mr Biden in the Oval Office on Thursday as well as the traditional shamrock ceremony will not take place, officials said. There were discussions between American and Irish officials about the potential of holding a virtual ceremony. This week was to have been Mr Martin’s first and possibly final opportunity to travel to the White House as Taoiseach. Last year, the trip was cancelled due to Covid. Mr Martin is scheduled to rotate out of the role of Taoiseach next December.

You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there.

In the last days, the Ukrainian president said, a family was killed by Russian missiles when they went to the memorial to remember the dead.‘Words are worth nothing’“After 80 years, every year, politicians repeat the words ‘no more war’,” said Mr Zelenskiy, “and we see now that these words are worth nothing”.After eight decades, he said, his people were being “annihilated” and, with them, everything they treasured.Mr Zelenskiy expressed his thanks to all in Germany who support Ukraine - civilians, politicians, journalists and firms who have “put morals over profit” and ceased trading with Russia.He concluded by recalling how former US president Ronald Reagan, in his speech to West Berlin in 1987, urged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down” the Berlin Wall.Addressing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, he urged the German leader to “destroy” the new, metaphoric wall created by Russia’s attack on Ukraine.“Give Germany the leadership role it has earned,” he said, “so that your descendants will be proud of you. Support Ukraine and its people, stop this war and help us to stop this war.”Since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, Germany has performed two significant u-turns: it suspended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and has begun delivering arms to Ukraine, shattering a decades-old taboo.In addition Chancellor Scholz has promised to bring Germany up to its Nato spending obligations and, in addition, announced a €100 billion defence fund to rebuild Germany’s defence capability after years of underinvestment.But Russia’s war on Ukraine has shattered Berlin’s decades-old policy of “transformation through trade” policy that made Germany one of Russia’s most significant foreign investors.Before the war there were more than 3,600 German-run companies in the country, employing nearly 280,000 people with direct investment amounting to about €25 billion.Now most big German companies, from Daimler and Volkswagen to Adidas and building materials giant Knauf, have ceased trading. Like other EU members, the German government is working to reduce its reliance on Russian energy. Last week in Versailles, however, Mr Scholz said he had made a “conscious decision” to continue buying Russian gas and oil, given Germany’s particular dependency.Mr Scholz did not respond to the Ukrainian president’s 15-minute address on thursday. Instead, Bundestag vice-president Katrin Göring-Eckardt thanked Mr Zelenskiy and, despite opposition protest, the order of business moved on to discuss Germany’s proposed vaccine mandate.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Phenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dodo could brought back extinction successful genome sequence","story":"The entire genome of the dodo has been sequenced for the first time, raising hopes that the bird could be brought back from extinction. Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told a Royal Society of Medicine webinar that her group would soon publish the complete DNA of a specimen in the Natural History Museum of Copenhagen.The flightless 3ft-tall bird was wiped out in the 17th-century, just 100 years after it was discovered on the island of Mauritius.Not only was it hunted by humans, it also became prey for the dogs, cats and pigs brought with the sailors as they explored the islands of the Indian Ocean.Asked whether the dodo genome had been completely sequenced, Prof Shapiro said: “Yes, the dodo genome is entirely sequenced because we sequenced it. It’s not been published yet, but it does exist and we’re working on it right now.”“I tried for a long time to get DNA from a specimen that’s in Oxford. We got a tiny little bit of DNA…but that particular sample didn’t have sufficiently well-preserved DNA.”She said that the team had now found “fantastic specimen” in Denmark.“So we have a very high quality, high coverage, dodo genome which will soon be published,” she added, but warned that it still could be tricky to bring back the bird.“Mammals are simpler,” she said. “If I have a cell and it’s living in a dish in the lab and I edit it so that it has a bit of Dodo DNA, how do I then transform that cell into a whole living, breathing, actual animal?“The way we can do this is to clone it, the same approach that was used to create Dolly the Sheep, but we don\u0027t know how to do that with birds because of the intricacies of their reproductive pathways.“So there needs to be another approach for birds and this is one really fundamental technological hurdle in de-extinction. There are groups working on different approaches for doing that and I have little doubt that we are going to get there but it is an additional hurdle for birds that we don’t have for mammals.”The dodo takes its name from the Portuguese word for fool after sailors mocked it for its apparent lack of fear of armed hunters.It is closely related genetically to the Nicobar pigeon, and it is likely scientists would edit pigeon DNA to include Dodo DNA if they wanted to bring back the species.Mike Benton, Professor of Vertebrate Palaeontology at the University of Bristol, said it would be preferable to bring back a dodo, rather than an animal from further back in time, because it could survive in today’s environment.However, he said it may not completely resemble the extinct bird.“The dodo is a popular bird and it’s one you can make a case for bringing back,” he said. “If you bring T-Rex back to life maybe that wouldn\u0027t be the popular thing as it would run riot and cause havoc.“But bringing back something that wasn’t so ancient would be much more feasible. The dodo has a known habitat that is readily available.“In terms of engineering the dodo, you would face all the problems that people have faced and the reality of generating of a whole new species, whether you could inject parts of that dodo DNA into a modern pigeon and somehow generate a dodo, it would probably not look anything quite like what we would expect a dodo to look like.”World-renowned geneticist Prof George Church and his team at Harvard University have been working for the past two years on recreating the DNA blueprint of the mammoth.He also said it was easier to engineer a mammal than to bring back a bird like the dodo.“Probably the easiest thing right now is to engineer a mammal,” he said. “But even if you can just bring some of the DNA back, those genes can be used in a whole variety of ways, for example restoring ersity to a species.“It means we are not limited to the last herd, we can go all over the world and backward in time and get ersity, and reach for inidual parts of the plants of animals.”More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Germany for financing Russian invasion\u0026#39To The Manor Born\u0026#39 star Peter Bowles dies from cancer aged 85St Patrick\u0026#39s Day 2022: Shamrocks, snakes and how a British slave became Ireland\u0026#39s patron saintSurvivors \u0026#39emerging alive\u0026#39 as rubble is cleared from bombed theatre in MariupolHoli Festival 2022: How the thwarting of a Hindu demon king led to the colourful celebrationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"paul pogbas house burgled playing manchester united against","story":"Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has revealed that his house was burgled while his two children were asleep in their bedroom as he played in the Champions League on Tuesday night. Pogba said his and wife Zulay’s “worst nightmare” had been realised and that the break-in, which happened while United were playing Atletico Madrid at Old Trafford, had stripped them of “our sense of safety and security”. Zulay was in the stands watching the match on Tuesday night.The France World Cup winner is the latest Premier League player to fall victim to criminals targeting homes in the north west area.Victor Lindelof, Pogba’s United team-mate, was playing against Brentford in January when his house was broken into while his wife and two young children were inside.That incident came a month after thieves broke into the home of Manchester City full-back Joao Cancelo, attacking him in front of his family before fleeing with jewellery.Pogba, who turned 29 on the day of the robbery, has offered a reward to anyone who can provide him with more information.He wrote on social media: “Last night our family\u0027s worst nightmare was realised when our home was broken into and burglarised while our babies were sleeping in their bedroom.“The burglars were in our home for less than five minutes but in that time they took from us something more valuable than anything we had in our home... our sense of safety and security.“This occurred during the final minutes of last night\u0027s match when they knew that we would not be home. My wife and I rushed home not knowing if our children were safe and unharmed.“As a father there is no feeling worse in this world than not being there to protect your children and I sincerely hope that no one ever has to feel what I felt last night.“It is for this reason that I would like to offer a reward for anyone who has a clue to help us.

Welcome home.”Mr Ashoori made a peace sign to journalists as the pair walked side by side from the runway to a building at the air force base in Oxfordshire.Looking forward to a new life, said Mr Ratcliffe.You can\u0027t get back the time that\u0027s gone. That\u0027s a fact. But we live in the future.Gabriella had already picked out the toys she wanted to show her mother.By 2.30am, the Ratcliffe family had left the airport to begin the next chapter in their lives, in a convoy of people carriers with tinted windows. Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guard arrested Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe in April 2016 at Tehran Imam airport while she was on holiday with her then 22-month-old daughter to visit her parents.Her captors claimed she was a British spy - a charge she has always denied.She spent the first month in a windowless two-by-one-metre cell, illuminated by a single lightbulb that was never allowed to go out.Interrogators spent countless hours trying to illicit a confession, frequently threatening to take away her daughter Gabriella and send her back to London.The charges against her have never been publicly revealed.Ms Truss said Oman had been “instrumental” in brokering the release. She was keen to separate the payment of the “legitimate debt” with the release of the prisoners, but sources confirmed that the plane could only take off once the transaction had been made.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Germany for financing Russian invasion\u0026#39To The Manor Born\u0026#39 star Peter Bowles dies from cancer aged 85St Patrick\u0026#39s Day 2022: Shamrocks, snakes and how a British slave became Ireland\u0026#39s patron saintSurvivors \u0026#39emerging alive\u0026#39 as rubble is cleared from bombed theatre in MariupolHoli Festival 2022: How the thwarting of a Hindu demon king led to the colourful celebrationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nothing woke online safety","story":"It’s a momentous day in the digital age. Years in the making, and with countless improvements to strengthen the legislation, today the Government is introducing its world-first Online Safety Bill to Parliament. It’s one of the most important things I’ve ever worked on – and it will finally bring some accountability to Silicon Valley.No one can deny it’s needed. While the internet has been a huge force for good in our lives – we wouldn’t have survived the pandemic without it – there are some glaring exceptions to that rule. Ones that, in particular, horrify any parent.Teenage girls are drawn into suicide chat rooms, or subjected to algorithms that litter their Instagram feeds with posts teaching them how to be bulimic or anorexic. Vulnerable users are radicalised online by terrorists, or stumble upon extreme pornography while browsing Twitter. A footballer misses a penalty and they’re bombarded with racist abuse. Grieving parents are trolled by ghouls.The result? People too often face a lose-lose situation: stay on social media and face a daily torrent of hate, or close down their accounts and miss out on the huge benefits of a healthy online life. It shouldn’t have to be like this. Ask most members of the general public, and they will tell you the Government needs to act. In fact, in the vast majority of cases this behaviour is banned by the platforms themselves. They just do very little to enforce it. Thankfully, much needed change is here.The Online Safety Bill will hold platforms to account in three key areas. Our absolute priority is protecting children and the vulnerable from harm. Social media companies will have a special duty to protect their youngest users. They’ll also have to urgently remove illegal content, such as child sexual abuse and terrorism.The major platforms will also have to enforce their own terms and conditions against racism, misogny, anti-Semitism and other forms of toxic abuse. Lastly, they’ll face new responsibilities to protect free speech and journalism online. Facebook and others will no longer be able to arbitrarily silence users with the click of a mouse, without explanation or access to appeal.If any of these companies fail in any of these things, they will suffer serious legal consequences. Huge billion-dollar fines will be coming their way. In the most egregious cases, Ofcom will have the power to block their sites, and to initiate criminal proceedings against named tech executives. That includes the very real possibility of jail time – and not years down the line, but shortly after this Bill becomes law.In the original Bill, Ofcom would have had to wait at least two years to pursue senior managers in criminal court. I’ve reduced the period to two months – one of the many changes I’ve made to strengthen this legislation. Accountability is hurtling down the tracks towards Silicon Valley execs. They no longer have the luxury of looking the other way.We have also listened to the Law Commission and created three new criminal offences in the Bill. Establishing these offences will help better address harmful online behaviours such as that of domestic abusers towards their victims, threats to rape, kill and inflict physical violence, and deliberately sharing dangerous disinformation about hoax Covid-19 treatments.This is what civilised societies do. In countless areas of life we’ve passed certain laws to protect people from grievous harm. Fifty years ago, we made seat belts compulsory in the UK. They haven’t ruined driving – but they have saved countless lives.And that’s what the Online Safety Bill is all about. It’s not about protecting adults from being offended online. It’s not about “cancelling” anyone. In fact, it contains stringent new protections for freedom of speech and journalism.In recent weeks social media firms have been quietly lobbying MPs over lunch. They have said the Bill will somehow be used to push a “woke” agenda. I think this is the first time I have ever been called “woke” in my life. It’s hardly a surprise that some in the tech world don’t like the Bill. We’re about to make them do more to protect children and others online – a duty they have failed at, with catastrophic consequences in a number of tragic cases.It’s time to think more about putting people’s safety first, rather than prioritising platform growth above all else. Our manifesto said we would make the UK the safest place in the world to go online. The  has rightly campaigned for a Duty of Care to protect users online. Today, we’ve moved one step closer to that goal.Nadine Dorries is Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and SportMore from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Germany for financing Russian invasion\u0026#39To The Manor Born\u0026#39 star Peter Bowles dies from cancer aged 85St Patrick\u0026#39s Day 2022: Shamrocks, snakes and how a British slave became Ireland\u0026#39s patron saintSurvivors \u0026#39emerging alive\u0026#39 as rubble is cleared from bombed theatre in MariupolHoli Festival 2022: How the thwarting of a Hindu demon king led to the colourful celebrationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russell brand became mad hatter conspiracy theories","story":"The mockney messiah with a man bun has found a new calling. Russell Brand, formerly known for stand-up comedy, hosting reality shows and making incendiary phone calls about granddaughters of Fawlty Towers actors, can now be found posting ‘truth-seeking’ daily videos and weekly podcasts to some 10m people across YouTube and Instagram. Recent episodes include ‘You’ve Been LIED To About Why Ukraine War Began’ ‘Can We REALLY Trust Vaccine Fact-Checkers??!’, and ‘Trump was RIGHT About Clinton \u0026amp Russia Collusion!!’. It’s all a far cry from the man three times named ‘S------ of the Year’ by The Sun.The charismatic Brand, who became ubiquitous in the mid-Noughties, has harnessed his popularity into virtual populism, his ‘anti-partisan’ videos winning millions of fans across both Left and Right. The 15-minute posts usually begin with thanks to “awakened beings” for joining the “journey to truth” he has defended both Putin and Trump, decries billionaires, and wants to root out racism. Brand detests authority – mass media and the Government being the primary evils – and wants revolution. So much so that he wrote a book of that name in 2014 (from the country pile of his then-girlfriend, heiress Jemima Khan).Seemingly modelling himself on Joe Rogan – the controversial US podcasting phenom who followed the stand-up to reality presenter to populist pundit pipeline to become one of the most powerful figures in American media – Brand promises to “say the unsayable”, earning himself a loyal, and large, following. The 46-year-old says he is not there to flout conspiracy theories, but to ask questions and “create new narratives” – a similar defence employed by Rogan, who in January found himself at the centre of a scandal after being accused of peddling Covid mistruths.One episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 11m listeners, resulted in a letter from more than 270 doctors slamming the programme as a “menace to public health”. Neil Young and Joni Mitchell told Spotify, the platform on which his podcast is streamed, that it had to ditch Rogan or their back catalogues Rogan won out. The brouhaha only solidified the status that the podcasting behemoths now wield – which is good news for brand Brand.There are major differences in their approaches, however. While both are martial arts fans keen to host isive figures – Rogan’s include ex-NRA leader and Sandy Hook-denier Alex Jones, academic Jordan Peterson and Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-Right Proud Boys group – the US presenter’s hours-long conversations belie a genuine desire to find what makes his interviewees tick. Brand is a different beast, his videos a stream of verbal ablutions that begin with a plea for viewers to buy tickets to his live tour (his T-shirts bearing anti-Government slogans sell for £25.99). ‘Stay Free’ is splashed across merch from tea towels to phone cases and mugs, the latter of which also features his face. His site promises that “grants using money generated by this endeavour” will be made, though no further details are provided.Brand – an avowed anti-capitalist with a net worth over £10m, according to Spear’s – was criticised for his 2017 book Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions, which some said was a for-profit version of the 12-step programme used for alcohol and drug addicts (which is available for free). “The point is that you don’t profit from the 12 steps,” says an insider who knew Brand as his star was rising that is “really frowned upon”. But he’s “very funny, he’s very charming,” she admits. “When I was with him, I felt like I was the only person in the world.”It is this “incredible ability to make people feel as though he’s talking just to them” that has supercharged his online success. “This is what it feels like to be part of a conversation,” he tells viewers in a video posted this week: “to be heard, to be seen.”Henry Jeffreys saw that appeal up close in 2007, when working as a publicist for My Booky Wook – Brand’s sex and drink-fuelled memoir. “People loved him,” he recalls of Brand’s effusive chats with old ladies and security guards. Back then, Brand was a household name, thanks to hosting E4’s spin-off show Big Brother’s Big Mouth, appearing in Hollywood films from Forgetting Sarah Marshall to Get Him to the Greek, and tabloid-documented liaisons with Kate Moss, Sadie Frost, Geri Halliwell (and many, many more).By the middle of the last decade, Brand had interviewed Holocaust-denier David Icke on multiple occasions and, in 2015, invited the would-be Labour leader Ed Miliband on his YouTube show, The Trews (a portmanteau of True News), so great was his appeal among young voters deemed to be by politicians. Brand, at the time, was not registered to vote.“There are particular iniduals within the anti-vaccine world who are amenable to pro-Russian propaganda,” according to Imran Ahmed, executive director of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, who notes that there is also crossover among supporters of QAnon (the group who believed Trump was fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles across the government, media and corporate worlds). Rather than these groups fading with Covid, experts warn that the same mindset – dismissing the prevailing logic so as to deny the status quo, no matter the evidence – will merely be transferred to other crises.This has also led to hybrid conspiracies: such as that the US has long had a secret, illegitimate bioweapons lab in Ukraine, which now works with bat-borne coronavirus samples, which Russia is simply attempting to destroy.Brand never clearly nails down his own views, “discussing” conspiracies, so as to skirt accusations of being a conspiracist. He is helped somewhat by those who still associate him with his cheeky Noughties screen persona and former marriage to pop star Katy Perry, as well as his quest for wellness – the subject of another of his YouTube channels – and faithful practise of yoga and veganism, all of which obfuscate possible sightings of tin foil hats.He is currently touring the UK with ‘The 33’, which consists of three segments – his back story, the hypocrisy of the Government during the pandemic, and a meditation with the crowd. An Instagram post from Monday’s show in Sheffield features him clasping the hands of an audience member, as others watch on in wonder at what Brand called “a magical meeting of souls”.Rogan’s brand remains more steak and dumbbells than spinach and savasanas. But the pair share a great deal: both are “funny and fearless”, says listener Jon Miltimore, 42, who appreciates their ability to “talk intelligently about complex ideas and provocative ideas” these are men who aren’t “afraid to poke at those sacred cows, and to question authority”.They share mutual affection, too. “You’ve emerged authentically,” Rogan told his British counterpart during a marathon three-and-a-half-hour episode of his podcast in 2019. “This is who you really are… you found yourself.”Brand – who posted videos of support over Rogan’s Spotify debacle earlier this year – also cited him in his 2019 book, Mentors, in a nod to his “influence and impact.” With a net worth of around £92m, Rogan is still around 10 times bigger than Brand – but with his YouTube subscribers climbing by a million in a month, that gap may yet be closing.My Booky Wook was a bestseller My Conspiracy Wiracy is looking like a dead cert.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Germany for financing Russian invasion\u0026#39To The Manor Born\u0026#39 star Peter Bowles dies from cancer aged 85St Patrick\u0026#39s Day 2022: Shamrocks, snakes and how a British slave became Ireland\u0026#39s patron saintSurvivors \u0026#39emerging alive\u0026#39 as rubble is cleared from bombed theatre in MariupolHoli Festival 2022: How the thwarting of a Hindu demon king led to the colourful celebrationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"1 4 women unable help","story":"Exclusive:  in  of women unable to get help they needed from NHS staff during labourThe Care Quality Commissions maternity survey shows that % of women were either \"sometimes\" able to get prompt care - or not at all - while in labour last yearByLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political Editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |comments Almost a quarter of women were unable to get help they needed from NHS staff while giving birth, a survey has revealed.The Care Quality Commissionaposs maternity survey shows that % of women were either sometimes able to get prompt care - or not at all - while in labour last year. This was up from % in . Some women did not get the postnatal care they wanted, with % of respondents wishing they could speak to or see a midwe more than they did, compared to % in . The watchdog also found % of women who needed it said that in the six weeks after the birth of their baby, they ‘definitely’ received help and advice from a midwe or health visitor about feeding their baby, down from % in . It comes after midwery leaders warned that worsening staffing shortages were hitting morale.  The Royal College of Midwivescalled on the Government last week to fix workforce issues, as a survey of its members last year found over halfof those considering leaving planned to go within the next year. Shadow Primary Care Minister Feryal Clark said: Women giving birth shouldn’t have to worry about whether they will be well looked after, safe and comfortable. After a decade of Conservative mismanagement, the NHS went into the pandemic with , fewer beds than in  and now it is losing more midwives than it is recruiting. It’s not just that the Tories didn’t fix the roof when the sun was shining, they dismantled the roof and removed the floorboards.The watchdog surveyed more than , women who gave birth in English hospitals during February  as the country faced its third national lockdown.The CQC said results had declined in some areas, but added despite the pressures of the pandemic, the majority of women continued to report positive experiences of maternity care. The CQC recently found that midwives at Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are worried about being “too exhausted to keep patients safe,” and that the trust does not have enough staff to keep women and babies safe. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “All women should feel supported during childbirth and receive the best quality maternity care. “We want the NHS to be the safest place in the world to give birth, which is why we’re aiming to hire , more midwives with a £ million recruitment drive.“More widely, we are driving women’s health to the top of the agenda through our upcoming Women’s Health Strategy and our dedicated Maternity Disparities Taskforce is examining how the government can continue to improve maternity care.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSCare Quality CommissionHospitalsGiving birth\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The coalition warns soaring inflation will force the poorest to pay £ a month extra for energy and £ a month extra for food this spring and summer. Yet despite unveiling gloom-laden inflation projections in next Wednesday’s Spring Statement, the Chancellor will raise benefits by just .%.That is £. a month on Universal Credit and comes after a £-a-week cut in October.The gulf will leave Universal Credit claimants £ worse off next year and drag , more people into poverty, the charities calculated.It comes after shock research by the Resolution Foundation last week found inflation is set to peak at .% in April after Russia ’s Ukraine invasion.The Mirror understands Whitehall officials believe this is accurate, and fear inflation could go even higher - even hitting %. That would smash the .% peak last hit in .  Fty-nine charities including the Child Poverty Action Group , Citizens Advice, Save the Children and Oxfam, issued a joint statement to MPs today. It said: “The soaring costs of essentials will hurt low-income families, whose budgets are already at breaking point, most.” It added: “A second cut to benefits in six months is unthinkable. “The government should increase benefits by at least % in April to match inflation, and ensure support for housing costs increases in line with rents. “All those struggling, including families affected by the benefit cap, must feel the impact.”  The Mirror understands Mr Sunak is unlikely to raise benefits by more than .% because of the multi-billion pound cost. Allies of the Chancellor believe boosting benefits would force him to raise public sector pay, pensions and other help too. Officials are also resisting any bid to give more help for energy bills before this Aprilaposs rise, instead waiting for another rise in October. But a former Treasury minister told the Mirror that approach is “not going to work”. They added: “He’s going to have to do something, it just can’t be the full Covid.” A Government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we’re providing support worth £ billion this financial year and next to help.

Fellow Brit Anousheh Ashouri, who was detained in , has also been freed and the pair are expected to arrive at home later tonight. Morad Tahbaz, an American-Iranian national, who also holds British citizenship, remains in Iran but he has been released on furlough from prison.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: I can confirm Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe and Anoosheh Ashoori willto the UK today, and Morad Tahbaz has been released from prison on furlough.They will be reunited with their families later today. We will continue to work to secure Moradaposs departure from Iran.Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe was held by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on trumped up national security charges in  after a holiday to introduce her young daughter Gabriella to her parents. Her husband Richard, who lives with six-year-old Gabriella in Hampstead, London, has campaigned tirelessly for her release, including by going on hunger strike in October last year. Mr Ashouri, a retired engineer, was arrested in  on spying charges after travelling out to visit his mother. Conservationist Morad Tabaz was detained by the authorities in .The news comes after efforts by five British Foreign Secretaries tried to secure their release, including Boris Johnson who was widely criticised for telling a Commons committee in  that she was teaching journalism in the country. Her family have always denied the claim.Ms Truss and Foreign Office officials have been engaged in intensive behind-the-scenes talks to secure their release and officials finally found a way to settle a -year-debt.  Hereaposs how the deal was done. Negotiations have been underway for a long time over securing the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe and other British nationals in Iran. Talks are understood to have intensied over the past six months, with help from the authorities in Oman. The pair are due to touch down in the Gulf state before ing to the UK later today. Alongside these talks, the UK has also settled a £ million debt to Iran which has proved a stumbling block to the release of British dual nationals. The -year row centres on Britainaposs sale of tanks to the Shah of Iran in the s. But the UK refused to send the tanks after the Iranian revolution, when the Shah was overthrown. Britain has today paid the debt, which appears to have been a signicant moment in the release of the detainees.  Officials have been working around the clock to find ways to pay the debt while complying the international sanctions imposed on Iran. The Foreign Office finally agreed that the funds can solely be used for humanitarian purposes. Ms Truss said it had been done in full compliance with UK and international sanctions and all legal obligations. The top Tory is said to have made securing their release and resolving the debt her top priorities when she took over as Foreign Secretary in September. After meeting all the families, she held talks with her Iranian counterpart in New York and tasked officials to hold talks in Tehran over October and November.  Omani ministers acted as mediators to help free the prisoners, with Ms Truss meeting the Omani Foreign Minister at Chevening in December. Negotiators travelled out to Omanaposs capital Muscat, last month to finalise the terms of their release. Ms Truss spoke twice to Iranian Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian in a final push to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion Talks have been ongoing for some time over the fate of the Brits in Iran but it is understood that the repayment of the debt got the deal over the line. However Mr Tabaz is still being kept in Iran on furlough from prison and there are other dual nationals who have not been freed.

The TUC said its study indicated that the cost of childcare was putting huge pressure on family budgets. One in seven of , workers surveyed said the costs take up more than half of their pay. Black and minority ethnic and disabled working parents were most likely to spend more of their wages on childcare bills because they were more likely to be in low paid jobs. TUC general secretary Frances OaposGrady said: Parents are spending a massive chunk of their pay packets on childcare bills, while their wages stagnate. This is putting huge pressure on family budgets. We desperately need a plan to get wages rising across the economy or too many families will have to choose between turning their heating on or putting food on the table.  Every worker in Britain should be paid a wage they can live on, that goes up with the cost of living, and the government must commit to a boost in childcare funding to ensure decent affordable childcare for everyone. The TUC called for an urgent cash boost for the sector to give childcare workers better wages, and a long-term funding settlement to make sure childcare is affordable and available for families. Helen Hayes, shadow minister for children and early years, said: Good quality childcare and early education is essential for children to thrive and for parents to pursue a career, but it is wholly unaffordable for far too many families.  Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, said: “It is widely accepted that high quality early years education can make a lasting dference to a child’s le. “The current levels of free childcare access for working families are not sufficient and there is evidence it may be contributing to the recent widening in the attainment gap. “As part of the solution, government should make the entitlement for  hours of funded childcare and early education universal so that every child has the very best start in le regardless of their background or their family’s circumstances.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Helen HayesPaul WhitemanFrances OGradyTrades Union CongressEducationNurseriesChildcareThe economy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Energy bills, National Insurance and inflation are all surging in April, outstripping benefit, pension and wage rises. Meanwhile tax and student loan repayment thresholds are being frozen in a squeeze on the cost of living. The Ukraine-Russia war will make inflation worse - and in a bombshell development, the Mirror understands Whitehall officials are braced for it to go higher than %. The SNP called for an emergency package of support while Labour demanded a windfall tax on oil giants. Boris Johnson said: “We’re taking steps to mitigate that to help people with the cost of living.” Yet Chancellor Rishi Sunak is understood to be strongly resisting bids to cut fuel duty, give more help for bills, or raise benefits or pensions by the same amount as inflation.So when and what is the Spring Statement, and what do we know about how it’s shaping up  Here’s what you need to know. When is the Spring Statement  Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the  Spring Statement on Wednesday  March at .pm. He will give a speech in the Commons, followed by documents and forecasts published online. After complaints from the Speaker, less of his statement is expected to be ‘trailed’ in advance. But the Chancellor is set to appear on Sunday morning TV this weekend to give a preview. What is the Spring Statement The Spring Statement is a ‘mini-Budget’ by the Chancellor on the situation facing the economy.It is lower-key than a Budget and does not contain the same tax and spending powers.For instance, fuel duty and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol were already set for the year in October’s Budget. So was the minimum wage rise from £. to £. in April - though you can expect Mr Sunak to crow about it anyway.What will Chancellor Rishi Sunak announce during the Spring Statement The Chancellor is expected to lay out the sheer scale of the cost-of-living disaster hitting poor Brits. This will be in the form of Office for Budget Responsibilityforecasts on GDP growth, borrowing, debt and inflation. They will also have the warm-up acts of the Bank of England’s interest rates decision tomorrow, and monthly inflation figures for February - which will be published at am on the day of the Spring Statement. While growth is rising post-Covid, so is inflation - and it is set to be much worse than the last forecast . All this will ramp up pressure to announce extra help for households - but he’s reluctant to do that. Soaring inflation looks set to push up his borrowing bill, reducing the amount he claims he can spend. He could recycle already-announced policies or announce vague ‘consultations’ on future ones, but will it be enough  UK inflation could rise over % Shock analysis last week found inflation is set to peak at .% in April after the Ukraine invasion made it even worse.The Mirror understands Whitehall officials believe this figure, calculated by the Resolution Foundation, is broadly accurate. Officials in fact fear it could go even higher, beating the .% rate of  and even hitting %. This will blow October’s forecasts - that inflation would peak at .% this year and could rise to .% - out of the water. It will mean more expensive food and goods in the shops, hitting the poorest families hardest.Will there be help with energy bills Rishi Sunak is reluctant to offer extra help on energy bills - despite soaring prices and mounting pressure from MPs and charities. Previously he announced a £ council tax discount for Bands A-D next month, and a £ repayable rebate in October. Yet bills are rising by £ a year on April  and will rise again in October - possibly by another £, a year. This is a far bigger hit to the poorest tenth of households who spend around % of their income on energy. The richest spend %. Treasury officials want to wait until the run-up to the October rise before announcing more help. But a former Treasury minister told the Mirror that approach is “not going to work”, adding: “He’s going to have to do something, it just can’t be the full Covid.” Laura Suter, head of personal finance at AJ Bell, speculated that ministers might raise the £ repayable bills discount in October, or put back the start of repayments, currently April .But Mr Sunak has rejected Labour’s calls to cut VAT on energy bills or impose a windfall tax. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: Millions of people are worried sick about soaring bills. Meanwhile, BP have said theyaposve got more cash than they know what to do with, and have compared their record profits from inflated prices to a cash machine.” A long-term energy supply planBoris Johnson will set out a long-term energy supply plan for the UK to wean off Russian oilby the end of the year. This is expected to invest more in renewable power and nuclear power, as well as trying to get more oil from places like Saudi. But it’s not directly connected to the Spring Statement and could be published on a dferent day next week.Will benefits and pensions rise in April Despite gloom-laden inflation predictions, Mr Sunak will raise benefits by just .% - as little as £. a month on Universal Credit. In October he cut Universal Credit for millions by £ a week. Pensions will also rise by just .% after the triple lock was axed. These are both real-terms cuts that will leave the poorest struggling more.In a Budget rabbit out of the hat in October, he handed more generous benefits to .million working families by cutting the Universal Credit taper rate from p to p. But this only helps those who work, not the sick or out-of-work.The Resolution Foundation is worried there will be a “rollercoaster” with real benefits down this year and up next year. Tory MP Nigel Mills suggested bringing forward next yearaposs increase in Universal Credit to this autumn to solve the problem. The Mirror understands Mr Sunak is unlikely to raise benefits by more than .% because of the multi-billion pound cost - and the need to raise pensions and pay at the same timehe does. Will there be a pay rise for nurses, teachers and other public sector workers from April  Inflation means planned rises to public sector wages - due every April - will be wiped out by prices. Rising prices put huge pressure on the Chancellor to give these vital key workers pay rises above % or %, to avoid hitting them with a real-terms cut. But the Treasury is resisting such big cash rises. The government has spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  .Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike.Pressure on the Chancellor to reverse this will be huge but again, it will take a lot for him to budge. Will fuel duty be cut Fuel duty was already frozen at October’s Budget for a th year in a row - handing £, to the average car driver since . Despite environmental fears, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is being pressed to go even further and actually cut it. One idea from a Tory MP is to give a % cut to vital fuel users, such as haulage firms. But it’s understood the Chancellor resists this idea, because it would not make a huge dference to the overall cost of a tank. Not compared to the huge rises coming from inflation and the war in Ukraine, anyway.Will National Insurance and other tax rises be cancelled National Insurance will rise from % to .% from April . Tory MPs are still pushing for this to be cancelled as it’s a major tax rise just as a cost-of-living crisis hits. Downing Street say the rise is going ahead, despite previous claims Boris Johnson was wobbling. But some Tories still hold out hope. One said: “If itaposs about pride, they can now say that Ukraine is the reason they need to change course. Meanwhile more than  MPs have backed a bid from left-wing MP Richard Burgon to replace the hike with a wealth tax on the richest %. He says the same amount of income could be raised with a .% tax on wealth above £m. There are other tax squeezes - the Income Tax personal allowance and p rate threshold will freeze at £, and £,. And the VAT rate for hospitality firms, currently .% due to Covid, is due toto %. There are spaces here for the Chancellor to act but it would scupper his claims to be recovering from Covid.A vision beyond Covid and the war The Chancellor will likely try to set out a world beyond Covid but the Ukraine war and soaring inflation will make this dficult. Expect many references to infrastructure and ‘levelling-up’ but be on the lookout for old pots of money being reannounced. One Tory admitted to the Mirror: “The Rachel Reeves line that weaposre a high tax, low growth Government is true at the moment. “We donapost seem to have many pro-growth policies, weaposve pretty much given up on supply-side reforms.

Days later, he oversaw the largest mass execution in the country’s history. He is betting countries like the UK will look away, because they would rather fund his blood-soaked petro-state than Putin’s war machine. It is not an either or. There are better and more sustainable ways to deal with the energy crisis than empowering these regimes. By visiting Saudi Arabia, Johnson will confirm that the Kingdom will face no meaningful consequences for this mass execution. It virtually guarantees more people whose only crime was to protest against Bin Salman’s rule will be executed. People like Hassan al Maliki, an academic currently facing a death sentence for owning banned books.  The  executions at the weekend were probably beheadings, but Saudi ‘justice’ is such a black box we can’t be sure. The European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, which tracks death sentences in Saudi Arabia, didn’t even know about  of the cases. These men were tried, convicted, sentenced and executed in complete secrecy.Of the  we do know about, at least three were tortured into making  confessions to terrorism offences after taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations. Aqil al-Faraj was held in solitary confinement, beaten all over his body and tortured with electricity and cigarette burns. He was imprisoned for five years, without access to a lawyer, before trial. This is the reality of Saudi capital punishment. The authorities label executed men ‘terrorists’ but there are political prisoners, non-violent drug offenders, and people arrested as children on death row. In , the UK and Saudi governments signed a top secret ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ on judicial co-operation. Since this agreement has been in place, the Saudi regime led by King Salman and his son has dramatically increased the pace of executions – there have been more than  in all. Ministers claim the UK is a restraining influence, but the Saudis don’t seem to have noticed.Visiting Riyadh so soon after this mass execution shames the Prime Minister and shames Britain. We must not show our revulsion for Vladimir Putin’s atrocities by rewarding those of Mohammed Bin Salman.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON King SalmanBoris JohnsonVladimir PutinTerrorismHuman rightsPoliticsRussia Ukraine warDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

An inspection found the pitot probe was blocked with a “solid soil-type material”. The next day a BA A parked in a bay nearby had a series of error messages on its flight display, caused by similar blockages, and the problem also forced a BA  to abandon take-off. The AAIB found eight planes in all were affected and sent samples to the Natural History Museum for analysis.  Wall mason wasps were found incubating in a BA Airbus  and there was an infestation of the hairy-toothed small leafcutter bee in a Virgin Airbus A The AAIB report said insect blockages were “not a new hazard, but one likely exacerbated due to the unusually low operational tempo in the pandemic”.

The -year-old hairdresser initially thought the alpaca was a large dog until the car stopped at a red light and she got a clearer view. Video shows the curious alpaca looking around outside with its head poking out, while the car had stopped. Its long dark brown neck pokes through the gap in the window as its head towers above the roof of the vehicle.  Just as the car begins to move off, the mammal retracts its neck back inside but still appears to be having a good gander out of the window. Kirsty posted the bizarre sighting on TikTok on Saturday, writing: “Meanwhile in Airdrie.” The video has since collected over , views and more than , likes. Hundreds of viewers left comments after being left in stitches by the clip. One person said: “To be fair, thataposs not the weirdest thing Iaposve seen in Airdrie or Coatbridge.” Another said: “Whataposs the highway code say about this one ” One shocked local commented: “When you think youaposve seen everything in Airdrie.” One user claimed the same alpaca paid visit to a local school that day . She said: “It was in my daughteraposs high school this afternoon, they brought it to Coatbridge High for a visit.” Alpacas are distinguishable apart from llamas by their signicantly shorter ears. They also tend to be much smaller than llamas whilst also having much shorter blunter faces than that of the more elongated llama.

Though he was less than impressed, Paul didnapost have time toto the store to lodge a complaint - and ended up having to skip lunch. Speaking to Hull Live about the ordeal, Paul said: When I received the pasty I saw it was an unusual shape and I thought, aposthis is strangeapos. On my way back to work, I bit into it and realised that it had no filling in it at all. I was quite deflated. I paid £. for a shell - a very disappointing shell.  I showed my friends and they all laughed at me. I was quite annoyed in the end as I didnapost have time to go back, so I ended up without any lunch. You just wonder, aposhow did that get out on the shelf apos Paul said: Iaposll still go back to Greggs because itaposs my favourite, but Iaposll have to check the weight of my pasty next time before I leave. They can trick me once, but they wonapost trick me twice! A Greggs spokesperson said: “Oh crumbs! We certainly didn’t intend for our Beef and Vegetable Pasty to be given to this customer without the tasty filling. “We’d love the customer to get in touch with us through our customer care team so we can put it right for them.  Just weeks ago, a similar incident sparked fury from chocolate fans. Angry KitKat customers sank their teeth into the confectionary classic only to find no wafer inside - just a solid choc bar. KitKats are traditionally a chocolate-coated biscuit bar with three layers of wafer biscuit inside. But it is not just the original bar showing up waferless - the brandaposs aposChunkyapos and flavoured ranges are too. One angry chocoholic Bronwyn Openshaw said: Iaposm actually quite upset because it doesnapost taste nice without the wafer. Tracy Bennett was equally unhappy and fumed: If I didnapost want wafer, I wouldnapost have bought a KitKat. Not happy. Yvonne Donnelly added: Gutted I got a KitKat with no wafers inside, just orange chocolate. Bels Reed even joked that the lack of wafer made her manager cry. Yet Logan Bradley bucked the trend and said: I just bit into a Kit Kat that didnapost have a wafer in it and honestly it made my whole day. KitKat, I love you.KitKats - made by Nestle - also came under fire last week for announcing it will discontinue its vegan options.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON GreggsFood\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Everyone involved in the strip search of a -year-old black schoolgirl needs to be sacked – immediately.That includes politan Police officers who carried out this utterly inappropriate act, and the staff at the school who called them in the first place and allowed this to happen. None of them should be in a position of authority over anyone, let alone children, again. The child was suspected of carrying cannabis. Let’s be clear, she wasn’t seen smoking or even in possession of the drug. Her “crime”, as far as the school and the police were concerned, was to allegedly smell of it. And that was enough for the full force of the law to descend on her.  Instead of calling her parents or another appropriate adult, the staff rang the police. The child was taken to the medical room of the school in Hackney, East London, and stripped-searched by two female officers while the teachers waited outside. The details of the intimate search are too graphic to go into. The girl was on her period and during the ordeal she was forced to take off her sanitary pad as officers searched for drugs. They didn’t find any. A child safeguarding review concluded this week the incident was unjustied and racism was “likely” to have been a factor. The review found it was highly likely there was “adultication bias”, where adults see black children as being older than they are and don’t treat them in age-appropriate ways. As a mother, and a mother of black children, it breaks my heart to think what this poor young girl went through. You’d think this type of treatment is reserved for terrorist suspects or highly dangerous criminals, not a child at school. She was treated this way because she is black. Her parents have spoken of the profound impact this ordeal has had on their daughter. She went from being “happy-go-lucky to a timid recluse”. Time and time again we see public authorities fail black children. And then they wonder why black communities have so little faith in them. The police have apologised. Standard procedure which means nothing. And the incident is being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. What we really need is action, to see heads roll and compensation for the girl and her family. I hope the young victim is getting all the support and care she needs to heal and live le to the full. She shouldn’t suffer for something that wasn’t her fault. If she does, that will be an even bigger failure.

But by simply switching off the engine while waiting in queues motorists could save hundreds of pounds, reported BirminghamLive. Motoring experts have said that cutting the engine while stationary could mean drivers end up spending £ less on petrol per year - and it is recommended by the Highway Code. By using this simple trick where the ignition is switched off as well, motorists will also be doing less damage to the environment.  The advice comes as drivers continue to be clobbered by record fuel prices as petrol reaches an average of £. per litre. MotorEasy founder and CEO Duncan McClure Fisher said: “One thing many people do that is entirely unnecessary is to leave their engine idling. This can be done first thing in the morning to ‘warm it up’ or when stuck in traffic. Even dropping off something at a friend’s house can see people leave the motor running instead of turning off the ignition. “While this might seem very innocent, research has shown an idling engine can burn through three to four pence of fuel a minute.  If you are doing  minutes of warming up, five days a week, and spending another  minutes per week stuck in traffic – that adds up to a very handy £ a year that’s being wasted.” Figures from data firm Experian Catalist show the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts has increased by  pence in the past month. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: With the spring statement just a week away, drivers will be looking to the chancellor to end their misery by cutting duty or VAT. One thingaposs for sure: simply reiterating that fuel duty has been frozen at  pence a litre simply isnapost going to cut it.

In the footage, the man, who is wearing a red bubble coat and backpack, begins small by stepping and moving his arms up and down, as a member of the public walks by. He soon picks up the pace by utilising the whole of the pavement. The man stretches his arms towards the sky and begins to spin around, kick out his legs, and moves his arms in isolated intervals. The moves spark infectious laughter with Hayley, who is filming, enjoying the show.One person tweeted: Living his best le. Is right!, while another posted: They say dance like no one is watching and he is. Brilliant. I wish I could dance like that... Brings smiles and that is great. A third user tweeted: Heaposs brilliant. Made my day, tell him he is famous. While a fourth posted: He was on the bus the other morning doing his exercises and dancing on the bus, heaposs a lovely fella. The unknown dancer was filmed on Great Homer Street in Liverpool.

Harley and Harry were conceived through IVF and were born at just  weeks and five days.Parents Jade and Steve Crane had been warned by doctors it could be a miscarriage as the tiny tots were so young, telling them to “prepare to say goodbye”.But when they were born they showed signs of le so the team burst into action.Now, after  days of intensive care, the brother and sister have been allowed to go home, the Liverpool Echo reports.Former mental health nurse Jade said: Iaposm so proud of my babies - theyaposre little fighters. “Theyaposre doing absolutely amazing. Theyaposre doing all the things that we were told they wouldnapost do - theyaposre crying, theyaposre surviving.  The doctors were saying the babies wouldnapost survive at this gestation. I was still two weeks away from what the UK classes as viable and the babies were given a zero per cent chance of survival. “It was only because I was at a teaching hospital and that the babies were born with signs of le that they chose to intervene medically.”The couple underwent eight cycles of IVF over  years as they tried to start their family, tragically suffering three miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy before the twins’ arrival.Jade discovered she had an overactive immune system, causing her body to reject the pregnancies before the couple moved from a fertility clinic in Nottingham to one on Harley Street in London.Jade was prescribed several types of medication in order to combat her immune system problems. Jade added: On our eighth cycle of IVF, we had two embryos transferred which both worked and we ended up with boy and girl twins. “I couldnapost let myself believe it, I was so fearful of a miscarriage or something going wrong. I was still in disbelief when we got to  weeks, and I hadnapost even hit my third trimester when I went into labour so we hadnapost bought anything. “The few bits of clothes that I did buy made me think that I better keep the tags on just in case - you just donapost want to let yourself believe. The couple checked in at Queens Medical Hospital in Nottingham on October  when Jade leaked fluid at home for several days at  weeks.  The babies were not considered to be viable and the poor mum believed she would lose her precious twins. She added: The doctor kept saying it was a miscarriage but I said it couldnapost be because I could feel the babies moving. I knew they were ok but was being told they wouldnapost survive at this gestation. It was only because the babies were born with signs of le that they chose to intervene medically. They were alive, moving around, and they cried. Their little cries sounded like a tiny kitten.” The tiny children were finally allowed home on Monday- just two weeks after their initial due date. Steve added: The absolutely stunning doctors, nurses and surgeons have all been part of the making of this moment. “Itaposs hard to say goodbye to them but I hope I never see them again.

It is hard to comprehend the torment she has endured since she was arrested on trumped-up charges by the Iranian authorities. Twice she went on hunger strike. Her health suffered. She lost two appeals and had her sentenced increased. Many would have been broken by this adversity but Nazanin’s spirit never faltered. It was matched only by the love, tenacity and dedication of her husband Richard who campaigned tirelessly for her release. They did not deserve to be the pawns in a diplomatic power game between London and Tehran. Nor did they deserve to be let down by Boris Johnson whose blundering prompted Iran to level fresh charges against her. This story was not destined to have a happy ending. The fact that it does is a testament to their resilience and devotion to each other.  No more delays Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion has created the worst humanitarian disaster in Europe since the Second World War. Almost three million Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes as they seek sanctuary from the Russian bombardment. That number is set to rise as more people flee the besieged cities in Eastern Ukraine. They are in desperate need of food, clothes and a place to live. The tens of thousands of people who have signed up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme shows that households across Britain are ready to help. The only thing standing in their way is the Government’s delay in carrying out checks. Now is the time for compassion, not cold-hearted box ticking and foot dragging.

David Bailey was working with Her Majesty back in , and just like with every other job, he wanted to help her feel as comfortable as possible.So, the famous snapper began reeling off a few jokes, namely about the impressive jewellery she was wearing at the time, but as he slipped into photographer-cum-comedian mode, David accidentally forgot who he was talking to - just for a second. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Speaking to The , David explained that mid-joke, he accidentally ended up calling the Queen by a slightly inappropriate pet name, when he referred to her as girl.The photographer was making light of the incredibly expensive jewels she was wearing, and jokingly asking herthey were real, when the mishap took place. David recalled: I said: aposI bet that cost a few bob, girlapos. It just came out. I call everyone aposgirlapos. Royal protocol means that members of the public should first address the Queen as aposYour Majesty,apos before going on to say aposMaaposam.apos There certainly doesnapost seem to be any reference to aposgirlapos in the royal handbook. However, it sounds like the Queen was as gracious as ever, with an unphased David going on to say, We had a laugh. Beautul skin, the Queen.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

A large high pressure system will bring the soaring temperatures on Friday but before that people are likely to wake up to frosty start on Thursday.The weather for the rest of March remains changeable with the UK set to see the highest temperatures of the year so far with it reaching C on Friday but there is then an unsettled outlook for next week. Going into Thursday, BBC weather said that it could get as low as -C in Scotland and it will be chilly with wind and rain for much of the day in the north while further south there will be warmer weather and sunshine.Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir said: “For the Western Isles and Northern Ireland the clouds will thicken here with some showery bursts of rain through the early hours of the morning and a strengthening wind. Elsewhere a fairly widespread frost leading to a cold start to the day come Thursday morning but for many it will be bright with some sunshine. It is not the case across western Scotland, you can see some heavy bursts of rain, snow above m or m. That rain extends down towards Northern Ireland. Ms Nasir said it is likely to be very warm over the weekend. Temperatures are on the up over the next few days you can see here most places will be fine and dry with some lovely sunshine, she continued. Into the weekend high pressure reaching across Denmark will allow for settled conditions to extend right across the UK, but some stronger winds on Saturday certainly, gusts over the hills and moors as well as the mountains but with a southerly wind it will feel very warm across some parts particularly I would say the Moray Firth where we could see an C.

Speaking about her experience, Abbey said: I got admitted for the kidney infection because I needed an intravenous drip and they kept me in for some more tests. But on one of the rounds of testing there was a bit of miscommunication - but it worked in my favour. The doctors asked meit hurt anywhere and I said it hurt to breathe, but I was referring to my kidney - he thought I meant my chest. They sent for further CT scans on my chest and found the aneurysmon my heart. I was there for  days, my mouth was full of ulcers and I had a lump under my armpit, which turned out to be an aneurysm as well.  Itaposs such a rare disease, normally no one would think about it being that. It was my second kidney infection in such a short period of time so I think that was a bit of a red flag. Boyfriend Jack Bates, , admitted he thinks without the shock diagnosis his girlfriend wouldnapost have made it to Christmas. The electrician has since decided to raise money for Dr Bergaposs research department with a three peaks challenge. He added: Her condition is a lot to take in some days, having to take some time off work to look after her, but it’s scary. The fundraiser is something I’d been wanting to do for a while, to try and raise money for Dr Berg’s research department and Behcetaposs UK as well. Without Dr Berg’s diagnosis in November , Christmas  would have been Abbey’s last. After receiving her diagnosis Abbey was placed on chemotherapy and steroid treatments to prevent the inflammation and will need heart surgery on a mm split which is leaking fluid. The -year-old hopes to be a mum one day and in an attempt to prevent the disease affecting her fertility she is having injections in an attempt to save her eggs. She added: I didn’t realise how serious it was, which was a good thing, but also when they came in to say I had to start chemotherapy and might not be able to have children, it was quite scary. I just thought I had a kidney infection but then they started talking about heart surgery and all this, it’s still strange now.  If I didn’t go in, they thought I was going to die, so it’s a good thing that I got a diagnosis. I’m not religious or anything like that but I do think someone was looking out for me, to go in with a kidney infection and come out with this. I had to leave my job because they said I couldn’t work for  weeks, which is almost a whole year, what was I supposed to do  I think also having an additional barrier of maybe not having children, I meant to be in the prime of my le. She admitted to feeling relieved to know the reason for her symptoms. Abbey added: To finally know what was causing my symptoms, I didn’t want to be in pain all the time, it was such a nice feeling to know that I wasn’t making it up. It was a relief, but it’s a shame that the treatment is so intense. It is for le and it is intense. I struggle to even walk my dog because of my chest pain. I had to get an ambulance last week because I honestly thought my aneurysm had ruptured, and I’ve never been so scared in my le. I really thought that it had ruptured and I was  and dead. It was so scary. Behcetaposs is an incurable form of vasculitis with ying symptoms, and with little research surrounding the illness, it is dficult to receive a diagnosis.

Details of the methods used on Baluchi - which date back to  - were revealed in documents declassied on Thursday. The report shows that the CIA went well beyond their usual techniques in Baluchiaposs case, and would strip him naked with trainees queuing up to smash his head into a wall. . Officers at the site - known as the Salt Pit and dubbed the darkness by prisoners - tested torture methods without approval from chiefs at the intelligence agency, the documents show. Baluchi remains in custody at the CIAaposs infamous Guantanamo Bay site and is one of five set to face a military court for his alleged involvement in financing the   terrorism plot.  The case itself has been on hold for over  years because lawyers have argued the testimony gathered under torture should not be allowed in court. The report is largely redacted, but there are several passages detailing the type of abuse he was subjected to. Officers at Cobalt, where prisoners were so broken they are said to have voluntarily put themselves on the water-boarding rack, used Baluchi as a living doll to demonstrate unapproved torture techniques to other agents.  The report details how officers used a technique known as Wailing to terrorise Baluchi. He would be naked when interrogators-in-training would line up to repeatedly slam his head into a wall made of plywood while he was restrained with a towel.The report explains: “The interrogators would grab the ends of the towel in front of and below the detainee’s face and shove [Mr Baluchi] backwards into the wall, never letting go of the towel.Baluchi has spoken before about his ordeal, with it only now being officially confirmed in the CIAaposs declassied papers. The horrors were made public as part of a legal challenge for Baluchi to be checked over by an independent physician.CAGE, an NGO campaigning for rule of law and end to the injustices of the War on Terror published an interview with the suspect on their website. In it, Baluchi said: “After US government agents shaved my head, they smashed my head against the wall repeatedly. It continued until I lost count at each session. “As my head was being hit each time I would see sparks of lights in my eyes. As the intensity of the sparks were increasing as a result of repeated hitting. All of a sudden I felt a strong jolt of electricity in my head then I couldn’t see anything and everything went dark and I passed out.”  “The US government had both my hands tied together by tight handcuffs for about  days straight,” he added. “They had to cut the handcuffs by bolt cutters because the handcuffs got so rusted that wouldn’t open with keys.” Baluchi was  in  when he was taken from Karachi in Pakistan and into US custody in what his lawyers claim was an extra-judicial arrest. The black site where the torture took place has reportedly been destroyed.

Stephen took to TikTok to share his insight on what itaposs like working on buses, saying he was sick of people blaming him when things donapost go their way.He said there were rules he had to follow - and one in particular related to the doors, as Stephen said he wasnapost allowed to open them again once they had been closed. Stephen, who drives buses in Glasgow, Scotland, said that the bus operators face a finethey open the doors after aposservicingapos a stop, and he could get in big trouble with his employerhe reopened them. What do you think about Stephenaposs insight  Let us know in the comments... Stephen, who posts to TikTok as @fatbusdriver, said: Quite a lot of people don’t know this. In the town, we are under TRC conditions which means they’re enforced by Glasgow City Council, SPT and our own inspectors.As soon as we’ve serviced a stop and the doors close we cannot open them again. The company faces a fine and can have their bus license for that vehicle taken off which means it costs them money. And we can get into serious s**t for it into the bargain. It’s nothing to do with the drivers. If it’s in the town that’s what it is,it’s outside the town I can’t say.

Fireworks were then set off behind the house as the voice of Dumbledore spoke the names of the Hogwarts houses, before an image of the Sorting Hat flashed up on their garage.The video, which was posted on Kaydenaposs @kaydenwwe account, then showed text displayed on the garage which read: Itaposs a girl!Angel then let off the smoke cannon he had been holding to reveal billowing pink smoke, confirming the couple are expecting a daughter. The extravagant gender reveal has sparked debate online though, as while some believe itaposs the best reveal theyaposve ever seen, others think the couple put too much into what could have been a more subdued affair. One person said: That was amazing. Best reveal I’ve ever seen. But another disagreed, writing: Youaposre doing way too much and taking way too long. I got bored halfway through! So pretentious, someone  posted. While a fourth had nothing but kind words to say, stating: This is the BEST ever reveal I have ever seen! Congratulations on your baby girl. There were even comments from some people who were tempted to try the light show out for themselves as they dared to ask how much it would cost - though no one was able to give them an answer.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Harry PotterPregnancyFireworksViral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I wish I had a phone with a really good zoom to be honest. “I’d be interested to hear what an expert would have to say. “Realistically, it’s probably a trick of the light, but it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before.” Sharing his footage online, Matthew soon discovered that he wasn’t alone in what he saw. “The most intriguing responses were the couple of people who claimed to have seen something very similar,” he said. “One person said they’d seen it that very same morning where in Scotland.” Mr Gowans kept his eyes on the mysterious presence for a couple of minutes, before looking away for a few seconds to check some of the footage he’d recorded. By the time he’d lted his eyes again, it was gone. “I’m disappointed I didn’t keep an eye on it for longer,” he said. And while some viewers have offered totally ordinary explanations for what he saw, its true nature remains a mystery.  Matthew said: “There were some definitive claims made about it, but the range of those claims proves it’s not cut and dry.“One person said it’s obviously a cloud, one person said it’s obviously a weather balloon, one person said it’s obviously a plane, and so forth.“Personally I don’t think it’s any of those things.” And when it comes to the extraterrestrial, Mr Gowans takes a nuanced view. He said: “Certainly there’s other intelligent le in space. People that believe otherwise sort of baffle me. I mean, the sheer size of the universe… “But, given that sheer size, I think the chances that aliens have made it all the way to Earth – or even been made aware of us – are slim. “There’s so many sightings these days, though, and that NASA investigation a while back was interesting – so many Navy pilots have recounted seemingly credible encounters.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NasaUFOs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jordan Mapes posted the picture of the cups online, where they sat alongside a note that explained how people could choose the cup that was right for them.The cups each had words printed on the front including strategy, articial intelligence, innovation, and leadership, and attendees were told to pick a cup based on what they wanted to talk to others about. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Alongside the cups, a note read: Pick a cup based on what you would like to discuss most. This will help everyone to network with like-minded people.Jordan, who posts on Twitter under the username @jordanmapes, then kicked off a debate around the idea of the cups, as she said she would simply not drink coffeeit meant she had to socialise at the same time.Many others took a similar stance, with thousands replying to the tweet to share their distaste for mingling at business meetings - especially when itaposs forced through the use of coffee cups. One person said: I would drink it from my cupped hands rather than go through this torture.  While another added: Nightmares from my days in marketing. And a third said: Strategy is literally my job and even I wouldnapost want this. Others jokingly shared what they would write on their own cups instead, with answers including dinosaurs, Fight Club, and memes. Someone tweeted: This is why I carry a Sharpie with me at all times. Iaposd have to put aposLeave me the f**k aloneapos. As someone  added: Just bring a sharpie with you, cross out whatever it says on your preferred colour of cup, and write aposcatsapos instead. But some were in favour of the idea, as one person pointed out the cups could actually be useful in the right setting, providing everyone involved actually wants to socialise. They said: I actually kinda like the idea, assuming that this is happening at some kind of conference or event where people came specically to discuss this kind of thing, as opposed to the cups being handed out to random people in the street or something. And another agreed, writing: This is dumb but % a genius event idea. Theyaposre always looking for ways to start conversations. Evenitaposs stupid it still works because people can laugh about it and still talk.

And for Rachel Jenkins, her decision to try out the £ bags offered on the app by Morrisons came with a hilarious surprise, as she opened her bag to find no less than  broccolis. Rachel, , from West London, said she chose to give the app a go after seeing it advertised online but was left bemused when instead of the iety of fruit, vegetables, meat, deli, cheese, and dairy that are on offer in the mystery bags, she instead got lumped with almost three dozen of the same green veg. The carer purchased the bag for £. on February  and picked it up later that evening, where she opened it to find  packets of double broccoli, along with one box of grapes, strawberries, and parsley.

The photo taken by Alisa Teptiuk, , travelled the internet leaving behind many questions and concerns. Belfast Live has exclusively shared the real story behind that incredible image, taken on a mobile phone by an exhausted we and mum as her family fled Ukraine for their lives.We tracked down Alisa to her temporary home in Poland where she explained how the snap of her beloved dog riding on her husbandaposs shoulder became world famous in an instant.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News BulletinhereUntil last month Alisa and husband Dmytro had lived in Kyiv with their two daughters and their German Shepherd. Le was settled and happy, the children were at school, the dog spent her days between walks and snoozes and the family’s grandparents doted on everyone. Now Alisa, her children and their dog are in exile in Warsaw where they are safe and close to her mother and sister. But Alisa’s beloved father is dead, still in a morgue in Kyiv awaiting burial, and her husband is back in Ukraine trying to take care of his parents and defend their home. With the Russian bombardment now hitting their hometown hard, Alisa is living in abject fear while trying to keep her feelings under wraps in front of her daughters - but she has one steady comfort, her dog Pulya.Follow all the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blogAlisa told DogsLive : “She is a comfort to all of us. She’s old but always the same, loving and gentle. We couldn’t leave her behind. Pulya is family. She is a German Shepherd aged  and a half, she is old and grey after a letime with us. We bought her on the first day of my maternity leave when she was almost four months old.“That day I began to train with her. She has been through the happiest and saddest moments of le with us. She understands us and loves us and we love her very much and will do everything to look after her and keep her safe. No one could convince us that Pulya could be left behind. It was not possible, we didn’t even think about it.Today she is alive and doing well, she stands as a symbol of love, devotion, determination, she represents our family, the lives we had, the lives weaposve left behind. Pulya is our one constant in all of this madness.”Pulya, whose name translates from Ukrainian to English as Bullet, travelled with her family of nine plus Alisa’s mother’s dog Kolt, aged four, in a small car for  miles heading to the safety of Poland.Alisa said: “It was my idea to go to the border but it was very painful to leave our home. My father died unexpectedly on February . He was just  and Dmytro and I tried everything to have him buried, but he’s still in the morgue because war broke out on February , the day after he died. “People were leaving Kyiv while my husband Dmytro and I were trying to sort out funeral documents at places all over the city in order to bury Dad. “We went from morgue to funeral agency to prosecutor’s office to registry office to morgue to funeral agency. The sirens were sounding all over the place and tanks were driving around the city. We had collected almost all the documents, booked a restaurant for a commemoration service and then discovered the registry office had been evacuated which left us without the one final document we needed.“In the end the crematorium refused to accept anyone. So my poor dad is still in the morgue. I hope that when I come back he’ll still be there. I will give him the best funeral I can. “It was heartbreaking but we had to go. We packed five adults, four children and our two dogs into a Peugeot  car and we drove out of Kyiv. We filled every bit of space, my mother, myself and my sister, our two husbands, the four children and two big dogs Pulya and Kolt. We drove for  hours to a village about  miles from Kyiv and then we stopped.” As the family drove on towards Poland the traffic grew heavier, and then they hit gridlock and faced the possibility of a three to five day journey inching to the border. Alisa said they felt like sitting ducks. Alisa explained: “We decided to leave the village later shortly after we arrived because it was just too dangerous to sit still, even there. As we got closer to the border there were a lot of cars queuing and we were told it would take the next three, or may five days to get to the border by car. We didnapost want to sit in a queue without shelter, open to the air, open to attack.  “So we decided to walk the last  miles. We left at am. It was minus seven degrees. It was a hard trip around mountains and rivers. Our kids were crying because it was so cold. I wanted to cry too, I could feel the tears travelling to my eyes but I couldn’t allow myself to cry, I couldn’t give up. It had been my idea to go to the border, we were almost there and we just had to keep going.” It was during that last stretch walking on the road that Alisa took the now famous photo of Pulya. She said: “Pulya was fantastic. She walked a lot of the way but she’s old and she needed to stop to rest and then she struggled to get back on her feet and she was getting slower and more tired.  “I stopped cars to beg for help but everyone refused. They told us to leave the dogs, to save our family. They didn’t understand, our dogs are our family too, Pulya comes too. “Pulya is no less family than anyone . She has been through everything with us, good times, happy days, hard times, sadness and now war and exile. And Kolt is the same. He’s my mum’s dog and all she has left of her former le, he is her comfort. “So we walked on and when Pulya got tired Dmytro lted her onto his shoulder and he carried her. I took a photo without thinking about it too much. I suppose I just wanted to capture the moment. But now I know how special it is. It shows the world our love and devotion. Weaposre just an ordinary family who love each other. Pulya was  kg when we started the walk. Sheaposs  kilos now. When she could walk no more Dmytro lted her. She was so calm. I think she understood we needed to keep moving and she needed to let us help her.Sheaposs a beautul dog. She reacted calmly to being lted, she didn’t struggle. You have to remember she knows we’re her family too and she completely trusts us. “We made it to the border, all  of the family including the dogs and we rested for a few hours. We could see rows of red tents and a big crowd. A woman asked me to take her -year-old daughter - someone was waiting for her in Poland. I agreed of course. “The decision to leave our home and the journey to Poland was hard physically and psychologically and we could see a lot of people around us needing help and medicine. “We rested in a tent for about seven hours together, the dogs and the five children. We were exhausted, sad and our feet were wet but we’d made it. We were safe.Before the war Alisa, , worked as a computer specialist for a German company helping develop Python, one of the worldaposs most popular programming languages that has been used to create everything from Netflix ’s recommendation algorithm to the software that controls self-driving cars. Her husband Dmytro, , worked as a fibre optic network installation engineer and was just about to start new high level qualications.Today work is just a memory for the couple and they donapost know what the future holds living more than  miles apart despite the success of their journey together to exile. Stepping onto Polish soil heralded a bittersweet victory because just hours later Dmytro and his brother-in-law had to turn around and make their way back to Ukraine. Alisa said: “We took our first steps into Poland and showed our passes and that was when I realised that weaposd be OK, that we were in a safe place. For a moment everything felt fine. “Our dogs passed their health checks and were allowed to come in with us but my husband and brother-in-law couldn’t cross the border because of their age and the mobilisation order. They had to go back home. “Right now I’m in limbo. I want my husband here with us but for now I must find a safe place to stay with my children. Weaposve not decided whether to stay here in Poland or go to Germany like many of my work colleagues. “It was so hard to leave my home, to leave Ukraine. First I lost my dad, and now I’ve left my husband there. Dmytro is such a big part of me, my best friend, companion, adviser.

walk on the wild side at its latest meeting as Argyll Estates# head stalker set his sights on an entertaining evening.Tom Kirsop provided society members with an informative and imaginative talk at their February gathering, covering his work and experiences on the local estate.Growing up in Clydebank, Tom had always had an interest in animals and moved to Argyll as a forest ranger in Dalmally.Since starting to work with Argyll Estates, which he thoroughly enjoys, Tom has been able to develop his work with animals in many dferent ways.In Queen Victoria’s time the current ,-acre estate was on an even bigger scale and has witnessed a huge increase in the number of deer since then.This has been due to the lack of any natural predators and, with further planting of trees since the s, the deer have had more protective covering.Modern inventions such as drones and the use of argocats, have made it easier for people working on estates to estimate numbers of deer more accurately and to be able to meet the necessary annual targets of keeping the deer population to manageable levels.Working on the estate also involves a range of other projects, such as collecting data on golden eagles, barn owls, making fishing available at the Glen Shira dam and taking clients out stalking.More recently Tom has started up West Highland Wildle Tours to give people of all ages a real insight into the wildle and beautul scenery on our doorstep.For the society#s March meeting, Ken MacTaggart will give a presentation about #The Medieval Pilgrim Way to Loch Awe#.The venue will be Inveraray church hall on Tuesday March , starting at .pm.Everyone is welcome.

I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#.

It is now waterlogged, not suitable for construction.An environmental impact assessment is essential. His proposed site is wild land, habitat to wildle – deer, foxes, possibly badgers, many bird species, some rare, and bats too.Lochend Wood will soon be completely surrounded by built environment.Development would be catastrophic for wildle, already suffering from signicant habitat loss and stress. Cllr Hampshire acknowledges “there is still wildle in the woodland and we will do everything we can to make sure we protect that”.Clearly, the best way to protect this area for wildle, including nocturnal species, is to NOT fill it with floodlights and noisy, boisterous humans.He continues: “People complain about young people hanging around and doing things they should not be doing.”Yet this proposal aims to attract kids to a location that is isolated and not overseen. This is dangerous. Emergency services have been called to deal with gatherings in the woods in recent times – ambulances for vulnerable young adolescents suffering serious alcohol effects, fire services, and police to disperse large groups.

Previous letters on the topic appear to favour somewhere between  per cent and a two-thirds majority of those voting, and deep down I cannot really disagree with that provided no additional hurdles are put in the way.It is also high time unionists stopped harping on about the “overwhelming” result for the No side in the referendum of . A two-thirds majority in favour of the Union would have been a result of .% instead of the somewhat lowly % achieved for the status quo and obviously % for the losers. Statistics can be moulded to any argument andwe look at actual votes rather than percentages in the  referendum, figures show that had only , more votes been cast for Yes than No, the result would have been for independence by one vote. Little wonder unionists were and are worried, especially as a new independence campaign is yet to start.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.BREXIT DAMAGE IS STILL EVIDENTTHE excellent Ian McConnell hits the mark with his revealing article on the grim reality of Brexit and the scale of the damage to exporters and trade . Astonishingly, we are constantly being assured by Boris Johnson and his ministers that Brexit has been a great success. The fact that the almost Soviet-sounding title of Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency has been awarded to Jacob Rees-Mogg, nicknamed the MP for the th Century, speaks volumes.Mr McConnell rightly points out that \"companies and consumers have had to become used to a lack of availability, delays in getting materials and parts, and higher prices for the things they can buy\". I know of at least one major retailer which in March is receiving deliveries of stock which were supposed to have arrived before Christmas.Ruth Marr, Stirling.ENERGY GIANTS SHOULD LEVEL DOWNI AM delighted to see that the UK Government is willing to support not only The Herald by paying for today’s “Levelling Up” cover , but also Scotland’s recycling aspirations by so efficiently topping up our blue bins.Within its inane covers, in the true tradition of trite Tory mantras, “Levelling Up” contrives to achieve a neatly-rounded -pronged aspiration. Number Four boasts “a £bn boost for the green industrial revolution”. Apart from the oxymoronic challenge of the language, the number rang a bell – double-digit billions of pounds. It echoes recent energy giant profits: over , ExxonMobil turned a £.bn loss into a £bn profit Shell has raised its £.bn to £.bn BP from £.bn to £.bn the “Big Six” British energy suppliers’ profits in were already over £bn.While our population faces unprecedented increases in energy costs, unprecedented profits from such polluters might have merited a “green industrial” windfall tax to ease our % hit. After all, Emmanuel Macron has instructed Eon to limit increased domestic charges to four per cent in France. But no, Boris Johnson deems that we have to cover costs.Keith Reid, Blairgowrie.* YOUR four-page advertisement for Levelling Up was a bit alarming: I thought UK Government civil servants would at least have a decent grasp of English. We had “more people owning their own homes – and much more to make a real dference to our everyday lives” printed twice in the same sentence. Perhaps an extended example of epizeuxis more likely just sloppiness. I’m not even sure that more home ownership, as encouraged by Margaret Thatcher, is automatically good, and I note that it’s followed by a plug for “a thriving private sector”.Elsewhere in the puff from gov.uk we had “Levelling Up means not only having more, but better skilled jobs”. Having more of what  And then there is “the £m Community Ownership Fund which gives people over the UK to protect and take over local assets…” I think I know what they mean, but it’s not written in the English taught by the redoubtable Doc Forrest at Robert Gordon’s College in Aberdeen.Feedback for the “UK Government Scotland”, as it styles itself: A poor effort, with little attention to detail must do better.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.STOP BACKING SAUDI REGIMEEIGHTY-ONE men are killed in one day by the Saudi Arabian regime under Prince Mohammed bin Salman with no condemnation by Boris Johnson and his Tory Government about these executions, due process violations or torture-extracted confessions . Instead he goes cap in hand to this dictatorship to plead for more oil to be produced to help the British economy.There will be no mention by Mr Johnson and his cronies about the arbitrary arrests and executions of  Shia Muslims among the above by the Saudi regime which has a record of persecution of this group. There will be no mark of respect for the lives stolen away like Aqeel Al-Faraj, Mortada al-Musa, Yasin al-Brahim, Mohammed al-Shakhouri , Asad Al-Shibr and others with relatives only belatedly finding out about their deaths and not knowing were they are buried.The invasion of Ukraine is a heinous crime condemned correctly by the British Government, but the unconditional support by that same Government of the brutal Saudi regime that tortures and kills their own people amounts to double standards.Sean Clerkin, Barrhead.SALUTE COURAGE OF JOURNALISTSTHE horric events being reported daily from Ukraine continue to shock and disgust. However, as the BBC correspondent Quentin Sommerville points out,we are surprised at the carnage and destruction that Vladimir Putin has unleashed upon the innocent, then we have not been paying attention. This is what Russian military forces do, whether in Georgia, Chechnya, Syria or now Ukraine.The grim news that two Fox News journalists and a US film maker have lost their lives in the countryreminds us that one of the pillars of democracy, freedom of speech, comes at a heavy price. Make no mistake, those who honestly report what is happening in areas of conflict are seen as targets by President Putin and his ilk. Marie Colvin, for example, was assassinated in a rocket attack in Syria by a government which disapproved of her journalism. The courage of Quentin Sommerville, Lyse Doucet, Lindsey Hilsum, Jeremy Bowen and others who keep us accurately informed about this war should not be underestimated, nor taken for granted.Bob Scott, Drymen.HAVE FACE MASKS BEEN WORKING NICOLA Sturgeon has delayed the plan to relax the legal requirement to wear masks in certain settings, because of, she says, “the current spike in case numbers” . But doesnt this spike suggest that masks havent been working Geoff Moore, Alness.* APPARENTLY Scotlands higher infection rates are, according to John Swinney, because we are \"ahead of the curve\" but this necessitating a further two weeks of mask wearing.Ive just ed from France, Netherlands and Italy, where they insist on you wearing FFP Medical Grade masks and consider cloth masks to be in the category of chocolate teapots.The First Minister might need to upgrade her natty tartan face coveringsshe is to re-enter the EU.Ian McNair, Cellardyke.Read more: We have to convince Putin that the West does have a red line"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-cracking-freedom-speech-universities-worrying-new-trend","story":"Freedom of speech, dialogue and debate is surely the raison dêtre of a university. Following the Nadhim Zahawi threat to ‘‘crack down hard’’ on pro-Kremlin views in higher education, the Scottish Government has been urged to do more to stop university lecturers sharing “pro-Putin propaganda’’ . As so often in these situations, JS Mill said it all: ‘‘The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is robbing the human race posterity as well as the existing generation those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth:wrong, they lose what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.’’It is clearly too late to promote such notions in our universities the remedy must begin in our schools. Every school should have a debating society, and every pupil should be a member and be given the tools and encouraged to develop and use their critical thinking skills to take part.Doug Clark, Currie.DOUBLE STANDARDS ON FOOTBALL PROTESTSWE all stand appalled at the attack on Ukraine and the dreadful impact this is having on the Ukrainian people.As a football supporter, seeing the many gestures, symbols and Ukraine flags of support flying in stadia across the UK has demonstrated the capacity of fans to come together to call out injustice and stand against oppression .It is welcome that footballing authorities have not imposed fines and sanctions on clubs for allowing this to happen.Why then have Scotland and some of its clubs been fined and sanctioned for flying flags of support for Palestinians who are continuing to endure military invasion and occupation  Does their resistance somehow disqualy them from offering support. What does that mean for future Ukrainian resistance Shrugging our shoulders at one breach of international law provides cover for other such breaches. Using football sanctions to enable \"sportswashing\" isn’t just about oligarchs and oil sheiks.Give the fines imposed on Scotland and its clubs to support those oppressed by war and invasion and stop the fines in future.John Davidson, Carnoustie.PLAYING DUMB WITH SMART METERSTHE back page of the Business section is of more than passing interest for me today as it mentions my energy supplier, Shell Energy and my smart meter provider, Smart Metering Systems . I had more than five years good experience with a former energy supplier who gave me a smart meter discounted rate because they didnt need to read the meters and I was provided with an In House Displaywhich allowed me to understand where and when energy was being used.Unfortunately, that provider was bought over by Shell Energyand after a bit, the gas consumption loggingon the IHD stopped working. To cut a long story short, following the installation of second-generation smart meters and a new IHD, the IHD is still blank and \"waiting for information\". Smart Metering Systems assures me theres nothing wrong at my end but \"the system\" is not receiving information from the supplier. Theres not a lot of incentive for Shell Energy to fix this, as it continues to get \"smart\" readings and is issuing bills. So it gave me £ off my bill and advice like the proverbial \"switch it off for  hours\" or \"you might need new meters\". Communication with the provider is not at all \"smart\".I suspect I am not the only energy user with similar problems and evenfixed, it doesnt look like the new IHDs are going to give me the same quality of information as I used to receive. Whether its because the national \"system\" is not working properly or the people at Shell Energy who are answering my complaints dont understand how it works, I dont know. However, Shell Energy is already at second from bottom on Which  Magazines customer score table and might get the wooden spoon in the next issue.Thomas GF Gray, Lenzie.FACULTY HEADS A FALSE ECONOMYI HAVE to agree with Eric Melvin , who stated that the creation of secondary school faculty heads was triggered by the need to save money. It was certainly not a proposition founded upon educational grounds.It meant that the head of faculty was responsible for a subject grouping in some of which that head had no real expertise, whereas the old subject principal was on top of the game with direct expertise in the areas under the subject principals control.Money and the saving thereof was at the root of that innovation and it has impaired the proficiency of the person at the top along with the performance of the members of the faculty who do not feel that they have any signicant part to play in that cobbling together of disparate disciplines.Throwing the baby out with the bathwater is characteristic of many educational reforms when politicians interfere in the running of the education system.We would not go about building houses in the way that we go about educating our youngsters. Unless the foundations are laid properly, there can be no satisfactory outcome in either case.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.GAMBLING WITH THE LOTTERYCAMELOT has lost the franchise for the National Lottery from . While I don’t necessarily approve of Camelot, I am concerned that the franchise for the lottery is being given to Allwyn, the UK subsidiary of Sazka.

Orkney Islands Council has announced that it will be installing card payment machines in its car parks, thanks to a boost from the Scottish Government.New ticket machines being installed in the coming weeks will offer contactless and chip and pin card payments.Work to install the machines – which will also accept coins – starts from Monday  March.The new machines are fully funded by the Scottish Government Place Based Investment Programme Capital Fund.All new machines are expected to be in place by the end of March.OIC’s roads support manager, Kenny Roy, said: “The existing machines require more and more maintenance now and are due to be replaced.“The option to pay by card has been a growing request over the past few years from our community and visitors, so we’re pleased to have secured funding from the Scottish Government to help us invest in that option.”Once works start, there will be periods during the installation of new power supplies and of the new machines, when parking in the car parks affected will be free of charge due to temporary unavailability of the machines.All other conditions of the car park order will continue to apply and be enforced, such as maximum stays and parking within marked bays.Drivers are being asked by the council to continue to use the bays in the short stay “pay and display” car parks for a maximum of three hours to ensure a turnover of available spaces. You should always check whether the machine is working and not assume free parking is available.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the UK and Ireland, men are three to four times more likely to die by suicide than women.Over three quarters of people in Northern Ireland living in rural areasalso said there was at least one barrier that would stop them reaching out for support eventhey were struggling. Lack of privacySamaritans discovered the top three barriers are concern over lack of privacy , not knowing who to turn toand stigma around mental health .As evidence suggests that suicide rates are higher in rural areas compared to urban areasiii and rural-based occupations, such as those in agriculture, have also been shown to have an increased risk of suicide, the UK’s leading suicide prevention charity is raising awareness amongst men in these environments to let them know they do not need to face things alone. Nigel, a Samaritan volunteer in Northern Ireland who is a farmer said: “The farming communities tend to have less contact with the outside world, they are isolated, feel undervalued and have many financial issues. Many are working full time in jobs and trying to farm at the same time.“From my experience farming communities are less likely to seek help as they don’t want other people to know about their problems, there is a real fear of being judged. As a farmer myself I get a lot from volunteering with Samaritans, I can be there for people when they need someone.”Real People, Real StoriesSpeaking about the Charity’s Real People, Real Stories campaign, Professor Siobhan O’Neill, Mental Health Champion for Northern Ireland said: “People who live in rural areas can feel disconnected and isolated, and this can lead to suicidal pain. “There is so much stigma surrounding mental health and it can be hard to find the words to say that we are struggling. It is important that we all understand and speak about our feelings, and that people who are suffering reach out for support. “Suicidal thoughts are a sign that something about our lives needs to change and this campaign shows us the benefits of reaching out for help and reminds us that change is possible”. Marie Nesbitt Samaritans Ballymena Branch Manager commented: “Samaritans is here for anyone struggling to cope, no matter who you are or where you are. “Mental health challenges and suicide are complex, going beyond simply where you live or what profession you are in but these can be factors. The increased risk factors for those living in rural and agricultural settings such as poor access to services, isolation and persistent loneliness mean it’s essential for us to do more to reach people in these environments. “We hope this new Real People, Real Stories campaign will raise awareness of the support that’s out there and encourage more people to seek help early on, so that we can continue the drive to reduce suicide rates across NI.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1583406084855.jpg--flybe_set_to_return_to_the_skies_from_belfast.jpg?1583406084000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220316newsflybe set to return to the skies from belfast","story":"Flybe is making ato Belfast, it has been announced.

To contribute to this, the Forests For our Future Programme announced by Mr Poots in March  set targets to create , hectares of new woodland by , which falls well short of those recommended by the Woodland Trust.The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas a woodland expansion target  hectares for  .Ammonia emissionsAmmonia is an air pollutant largely emitted from agriculture and has a damaging impact on bioersity, including sensitive habitats, as well as human health. It is produced by many common farming activities, such as the housing of livestock, the storage and spreading of manure and slurries, and the application of fertiliser.An Audit Office report from February found that most areas of Northern Ireland, including designated sites and other priority habitats, are affected by high levels of nitrogen being deposited on land and into water surfaces.The levels in most areas are signicantly above what is considered their “critical load”, the concentration of nitrogen at which signicant ecological damage occurs. Northern Ireland is responsible for % of UK ammonia emissions, despite only having % of its population and % of its land area, and is the only region of the UK where ammonia levels have not been decreasing.“Failure to address the increasing level of ammonia emissions also has the potential to contribute to serious, long-term harm to the environment and human health,” the report concluded.Mr Poots has conceded that a failure to publish an Ammonia Reduction Strategywill be a regret when he leaves office and it is one that has left the department vulnerable to legal challenge. However, he stresses that he wants to publish a strategy before leaving office.Independent Environmental Protection AgencyUnder an outline programme for government in the New Decade, New Approach, a number of coordinated measures to reverse climate change were laid out.They included an Independent Environmental Protection Agencyto oversee targets that would be set as part of climate change legislation.Mr Poots is opposed to the establishment of an IEPA, believing it to be unnecessary bureaucracy. However, he has proposed setting up an office of environmental protection to do similar independent work.Conservation Management PlansNorthern Ireland is home to important nature and wildle, of both national and international importance, which are a key part of the Northern Ireland landscape, providing a wide range of goods and services to society and helping to deal with climate change.The UK faced formal infringement proceedings by the European Commission because of the failure to have in place Conservation Management Plansfor its European sites.There are  special areas of conservation and  special protection areas in Northern Ireland. Strangford Lough and Rathlin Island were reported to the commission as having a CMP in place.That leaves  sites without such plans in Northern Ireland.At the time of the infraction proceedings it was reported to the Commission Rathlin Island and Strangford Lough had Conservation Management Plansin place.The Commission took the view that developing CMPs for each of the remaining SACs would signicantly contribute to addressing the alleged failings to comply with the obligations under the Habitats Directive.DAERA subsequently embarked on a signicant programme of work to develop such CMPs to date draft CMPs have been developed for  of the SAC sites, with the intention to have draft plans for all SACs completed by December .Clear AirAir pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and the fourth greatest threat to public health after cancer, heart disease and obesity.The Clean Air Strategy, published in January  by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs , sets out a number of objectives to improve air quality across the UK.Additionally, DAERA issued a Clean Air Strategy for Northern Ireland Discussion Document for public consideration in November . The period of public discussion closed in early .This strategy aims to build on existing improvements within Northern Ireland and seeks to tackle important cross-Departmental issues relating to transport, energy, agriculture, industry, local air quality management, and communications.An air quality strategy was anticipated but has not been published. Minister Poots says that recommendations await the next office holder.Mobuoy super dumpAt public meetings, government officials have been repeatedly challenged to urgently deal with an estimated one million cubic metres of waste at the Mobuoy “super dump” on the outskirts of Derry. The River Faughan which forms the western boundary of the site supplies the city with % of its drinking water.Ongoing legal action has been blamed for delaying remediation work at the site. That trial is due to commence next month.The clean-up cost at Mobuoy has been estimated at a minimum of £ million — and potentially as much as £ million.NI Water and DAERA have always assured the public that chemicals present in drinking water are at safe levels. However, campaigners contend there are “no safe levels” of arsenic or manganese as exposure to such chemicals can have a long-term damaging effect on the brain.It is expected that based on successful approval of a business case, a remediation contractor will be appointed by late .Ban on petroleum licensingIn a somewhat unexpected move, the DUP Economy Minister, Gordon Lyons, announced that he would support a ban on fracking and onshore petroleum licensing activity in Northern Ireland.Fracking is broadly banned across the UK and Ireland. In England, the Government told the industry it would not agree to any future fracking “until compelling new evidence is provided” that it was safe.Two petroleum licensing applications in NI relate to Fermanagh, where a company called Tamboran Resources UK applied for a licence in .A separate application from EHA Exploration takes in five council areas: Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Mid Ulster.However, Sinn Fein said it is “bitterly disappointing” that as a result of the DUP collapsing the Executive, that ban cannot now be brought forward.Water pollutionA recent ‘Water Framework Directive Statistics Report’ determined that none of Northern Ireland’s  rivers, lakes and coastal waters achieved a “good overall status” rating for water quality.Environmentalists have argued that minimal fines handed down for water pollution do not act as an appropriate deterrent for repeat offenders.Figures obtained by Green Party MLA Rachel Woods showed that more than seven million tonnes of raw sewage is being dumped into Northern Ireland’s seas and rivers every year.NI Water requires investment of around £bn in water and wastewater services over a six year period, the Utility Regulator said in May. This financial year the DfI Minister allocated a combined budget £m to NI Water for  .Coal banSmoky coal is one of the worst causes of air pollution. It has been reported that approximately , premature deaths have been averted in Dublin since the introduction of a coal ban back in . In the past, DUP MP Sammy Wilson strongly opposed proposals saying that low-income households who use cheap coal would be adversely affected as smokeless coal costs more.In response, then Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said: “It is great to hear Saint Sammy, defender of the disadvantaged — I do not know what happened to Sammy, the champion of the Tory cuts — make all these arguments on behalf of those suffering fuel poverty.“There is not a word about the big business interests of those in the coal business or, indeed, the interests of Larne port in his own constituency.”DUP MLA Michelle McIlveen, who was DAERA Minister before the Assembly collapsed, also said it was not her intention to ban smoky coal in the North.Now, Mr Poots, says he has no intention of banning coal because people would “die of hypothermia” in homes that are not properly insulated.Most ReadFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestBBC’s Emma Vardy is on the crest of a wave... and set to tie the knot at Co Antrim fairytale castleA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland Latest EnvironmentMLA seeks to investigate recent surge in fuel prices amid Kilroot Power Station confusionUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontStormont crisis ‘farcical and very damaging’ – Green Party leader easy ways to ‘green-proof’ your home that won’t cost the earth and will reduce your billsSam McBrideOpinionBasic, inexcusable failures mean that recyclable items are being dumpedLatestFuel price hikes risk sending UK into ‘de facto lockdown’, Tory warns ministersIn Pictures: The world goes green as celebrations mark St Patrick’s DayDamian Penaud s for France against EnglandTo The Manor Born star Peter Bowles dies aged DWP job cuts mean workers are being ‘abandoned’, says union,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It featured an array of talents from across the island.Families were treated to stage highlights from the Duncairn Creative Collective, a brand new collaborative project that brings together more than  independent musicians from dferent backgrounds and genres.There were also memorable performances from the Irish duo Mick Flannery and Susan O’Neill, rising star Tolü Makay, Lisburn singer-songwriter Joshua Burnside and Armagh-born tin whistle and flute player Brian Finnegan.Belfast City Council estimated that around , people attended the free event. It is anticipating “a great turnout” for the main parade on Thursday, titled ‘We Are All Patrick’.

A traffic management system and signage will be in place, with motorists asked to follow any directions issued by the PSNI.The police also urged residents and visitors to “enjoy all that Belfast has to offer safely”.Chief Inspector Gavin Kirkpatrick warned that any “overindulgences in alcohol” that lead to antisocial or violent behaviour “will not be tolerated”.He said that, alongside colleagues from the council, universities and schools, police “have again been working hard to highlight that the Holyland area of south Belfast is a residential area, not a party or nightle destination”.The area is popular with students and has witnessed thousands of young people flocking to its streets on St Patrick’s Day for parties that sometimes result in criminality. Police have launched a crackdown on problem behaviour in the neighbourhood named Operation Exposure. Officers have asked parents and s to ensure they know where their children are and to warn them about “the impact of underage drinking”. Those intending to go out for a few drinks have been urged to leave their cars at home and use alternative means of transport, with the PSNI reminding motorists that “drink-driving laws will, as always, be robustly enforced during St Patrick’s Day and across the weekend”.Other St Patrick’s events will be in full flow across Northern Ireland on Thursday, with Derry city to host its Spring Carnival Parade, which aims to feature more than  participants. Foyleside Shopping Centre will be hosting a ‘Feel Lucky’ event from  to pm, featuring Irish dancing, traditional music, face painting, balloon modelling and more. Armagh city, where St Patrick built his great stone church in AD, making it the centre of the church in Ireland, will have its parade at .pm. It will be followed by a family fun afternoon, with free admission, in the Shambles Market until pm.In Tyrone, meanwhile, Strabane and Cookstown will be hosting their own parades, kicking off at pm and .pm respectively. Omagh’s town centre will host a programme of music and dance throughout the afternoon. Mid Ulster District Council will be having a free day of celebrations in Dungannon from pm to pm. In Fermanagh, Enniskillen town centre will be full of street entertainment, and the castle is hosting an exciting programme for families with food vendors and a craft fair.In Co Down, you can visit St Patrick’s grave at the cathedral in Downpatrick, followed by an array of free celebrations commencing at noon in the town’s St Patrick’s Square.Whatever happens, be prepared for a green and orange St Patrick’s Day, with rare ‘blood rain’ potentially falling on Northern Ireland on Thursday. It is currently sweeping across Europe, triggered by a huge Saharan dust storm.Blood rain happens when red-coloured sand or dust finds its way into clouds, giving the rain a red appearance as it falls.Satellite images published by the Met Office hint that the dust clouds could make their way from North Africa towards the island of Ireland. Pictures from Portugal, Germany and Spain have shown the sky glowing an orange colour because of the phenomenon.Related topicsSt. Patrick#s DayBelfast City CouncilPolice Service of Northern IrelandMore On St. Patricks DaySt Patrick’s Day : Dublin parade in picturesTaoiseach Micheál Martin tests positive for Covid on St Patrick’s Day visit to Washington ahead of planned meeting with Joe BidenSt Patrick’s Day : Events and activities across Northern Ireland this March John C Reilly happy to ‘spread joy’ as a special St Patrick’s Day guest in DublinPoliticians from both sides of border tout for business as trade and tourism on agenda in USMost ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaNorthern Ireland power station wants to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland Latest Northern IrelandViewpointOpinionA lasting legacy for a remarkable teenArmagh pair among three sets of twins to star in musical adaption of The Parent TrapSt Patrick’s Day : Dublin celebrationsafter two-year Covid absencePO Ferries ‘unable to run services’ due to upcoming company announcementTyrone McKenna will continue to entertain and have fun with world title shot against Regis Prograis on the lineLatestDamian Penaud s for France against EnglandTo The Manor Born star Peter Bowles dies aged DWP job cuts mean workers are being ‘abandoned’, says unionE-tickets soar as Trainline continues Covid bouncebackRussian air strike appeared to target civilian building in Mariupol – Cleverly,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Kilroot power station said that shipment was not for it, and it last brought in Russian coal on th February. The power station, which dominates the northern shoreline of Belfast Lough just east of Carrickfergus, is our last coal-fired electricity generation plant and is due to close next year.Read MoreUkrainian refugee scheme: Vital that sponsors in Northern Ireland are properly checked, warns anti-slavery expertUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontHowever, it is still key to keeping the lights on, and has been called upon more in recent years due to problems at other power stations and unusually calm days reducing wind power generation.Coal was Russia’s third most valuable export by value in , bringing in £.bn. Northern Ireland was the only UK region to see coal-fired electricity generation increase that year, accounting for % of all electricity.Energy imports from Russia have not been banned, but have come under scrutiny due to revulsion at Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of the war through the targeting of civilians.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Kilroot’s position appears similar to that of Shell, which bought Russian oil — entirely legally — days into the Ukraine war, but backtracked under huge public pressure and promised not to do so again.Read MoreMalachi O#Doherty:OpinionMy utility bills now cost £ a week. Pensioners are in big troubleHowever, Kilroot’s situation is complicated by what it says is a requirement in its licence to buy Russian coal for environmental reasons, because it is low-sulphur, and thus somewhat reduces air pollution when burned.!forfort[r].style.e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"When Stormont’s Department for the Economy, which is responsible for electricity policy, was askedit believed environmental rules should be relaxed to allow Kilroot to burn dirtier coal, it initially washed its hands of the matter, saying: “The department does not have responsibility for environmental rules. This is the responsibility of DAERA Northern Ireland Environment Agency .”That answer came despite the RHI Inquiry recommending Stormont stopped operating in silos and behaved coherently as a single government entity.However, Kilroot’s owner then told the Belfastit had been meeting the department, NIEA, electricity grid operator SONI and the Utility Regulator to discuss this issue since the crisis began. That was put to the Department for the Economy and to Edwin Poots’ Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for NIEA.But there was no response at the time of going to press.EP Kilroot, a subsidiary of Czech company Energetický, which owns the plant, said it “condemns the indefensible aggression and actions by Russia”.It added that it “complies with all UK sanctions and associated regulations in relation to Russia”, and stressed there were “signicant stock levels of coal on the Kilroot site at present”.It said: “We have contingency plans in place for alternative sources of coal supply. “This plan requires changing EP Kilroot’s permit, which currently prevents us from using coals from other countries.“Since the start of the Ukraine crisis, EP Kilroot has chaired a number of roundtable workshops with officials from DfE, NIEA, the Utility Regulator and SONI to urgently address the issues of the current permitting arrangements to enable EP Kilroot to remove its reliance on Russian coal.“If the permitting arrangements are not changed, we believe there will be signicant security of supply risks that SONI will need to manage.”The company claimed there could also be “signicant additional costs” for consumers “depending on the extent to which the coal units are restricted”.When DfE, headed by DUP minister Gordon Lyons, was asked for its view on whether Kilroot should continue to buy Russian coal, the department expressed no preference, and said: “The purchase of coal is a commercial decision taken by EP Kilroot. However, the department will follow the guidance that has been issued by the UK Government in relation to Russian imports.”When asked how much coal stocks were in place at Kilroot, DfE said “this is not a matter for the department”, but SONI would tell itthere was a problem. When asked how much secondary fuel was stored at Kilroot, DfE said that was a matter for the company.SONI said it was “unaware of any immediate risk to coal stock at Kilroot”. It said inspection of fuel stocks was “not a matter for SONI”. It added Kilroot “has a key role to play in the energy transition”, involving the current generators as well as new gas turbines.Belfast Harbour said it was “working closely with shipping agents and relevant partners to implement all of the Government’s legislative sanctions on Russian vessels”, but it would only bar vessels excluded by law, rather than go further.The Utility Regulator said Kilroot was responsible for ensuring it held adequate fuel stocks. It added: “In light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we are working with DfE to proactively monitor the situation, and are engaging with EP Kilroot and other key stakeholders on a regular basis about fuel stocks and fuel security arrangements.”Overall imports of coal have generally been falling, but have risen to the point where they are now roughly where they were in , despite the reduction in the use of coal for home-heating and electricity generation.Irish state-owned electricity company ESB said it will not be taking delivery of Russian coal to its Moneypoint power station in Co Clare “for the foreseeable future”. It was reported that members of staff at the River Shannon facility had expressed concerns to management about accepting Russian coal in the current circumstances.On Monday, Andrei Melnichenko, owner of Russia’s biggest coal producer, said publicly that the war in Ukraine was a tragedy that must be stopped.Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaNorthern Ireland power station wants to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland Latest Northern IrelandViewpointOpinionA lasting legacy for a remarkable teenArmagh pair among three sets of twins to star in musical adaption of The Parent TrapSt Patrick’s Day : Dublin celebrationsafter two-year Covid absencePO Ferries ‘unable to run services’ due to upcoming company announcementTyrone McKenna will continue to entertain and have fun with world title shot against Regis Prograis on the lineLatestTo The Manor Born star Peter Bowles dies aged DWP job cuts mean workers are being ‘abandoned’, says unionE-tickets soar as Trainline continues Covid bouncebackRussian air strike appeared to target civilian building in Mariupol – CleverlyViewpointOpinionA lasting legacy for a remarkable teen,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s really demoralising.“I also have to get taxis to and from work, which is around a trip fare of £. It takes me three hours at work to pay for my travel with my shts on average being between seven and eight hours.”With the cost-of-living crisis, she said young workers feel they should receive a pay rise and get the top minimum wage hourly rate of £., as they work as hard as someone aged .Unison’s Saoirse Fanning said the survey findings around Covid were particularly concerning.Twenty-five per cent could not self-isolate, % couldn’t afford to, and % said their employer wouldn’t allow it.She added: “We have been fighting for our members to get paid in full while off sick with Covid- or having to isolate.“Some employers were only paying statutory sick pay, even though money was available from the Department for Communities to pay staff in full.” She said the privatisation of services meant front line staff were on “poverty pay and poor terms and conditions”.She called for a social clause to be included in all contracts outsourced to the community sector.Independent councillor Gary Donnelly said what he was hearing was “shocking”, and asked what council could do to assist.Ms Ward said workers doing the same job should receive the same pay rate regardless of age.Mr McCarroll said Derry suffered from deprivation and neglect from ious governments and it can’t be the case that the city progresses on the back of local workers getting paid just over £ an hour without sick pay.He suggested the council look at wage inequalities and exploitation, and that hospitality businesses should make their pay rates known on menus.People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin branded wages for teenagers “a disgrace” and said every worker should receive at least the minimum wage.He proposed initiating research to get an accurate assessment of pay scales across the council area. He was told a motion could be brought before the full council.Councillor Derek Hussey, who has been in the hospitality business since , said he was “really shocked” by Grace and Cliona’s revelations.“The figures you’re quoting, I wouldn’t have got away with back when I first started in the business,” he added.“At the weekend I had an event and had to bring in part-time workers. I can assure you that I had to pay well — well over the minimum wage in order to actually get folk to work.”The DUP’s Hilary McClintock said for someone to have to work for three hours to pay travel and to not have guaranteed hours was “exploitation”.Related topicsDerry City and Strabane District CouncilCost of LivingPeople Before ProfitMore On Derry City and Strabane District CouncilNI was ‘undersold’ by Government’s levelling-up fund, insists CampbellNI rates explainer: Why are they rising and where is your money going Bigger rates bills on way for all Northern Ireland householdsCouncil withholds £ Good Relations funding from Castlederg loyalist bandPolice in Derry investigate ‘unnotied parade’ not connected to commemorationsMost ReadFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestBBC’s Emma Vardy is on the crest of a wave... and set to tie the knot at Co Antrim fairytale castleA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland Latest Northern IrelandIn Pictures: The world goes green as celebrations mark St Patrick’s DayViewpointOpinionA lasting legacy for a remarkable teenArmagh pair among three sets of twins to star in musical adaption of The Parent TrapSt Patrick’s Day : Dublin celebrationsafter two-year Covid absencePO Ferries ‘unable to run services’ due to upcoming company announcementLatestKate Garraway to host new ITV Saturday morning show‘Why  Why  Why ’ Ukraine’s Mariupol descends into despairFuel price hikes risk sending UK into ‘de facto lockdown’, Tory warns ministersIn Pictures: The world goes green as celebrations mark St Patrick’s DayDamian Penaud s for France against England,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

To be honest, I’m not sure what I expected, but I know it wasn’t what I got.Maybe I thought the crisp pieces would be much more prominent, maybe more of a crunch in the chocolate And I know I definitely thought the strong taste of Tayto cheese and onion would be more at the forefront.In short, to me it’s a little reminiscent of the popping candy chocolate. It’s chocolate with a little added something, but I don’t thinkyou were blind-folded you would know that it was crisp pieces.Personally, I couldn’t really taste the bits of Tayto crisps — unless the bar I got had a little less sprinkling of crisps pieces than others. Sadly, it just didn’t seem to live up to the hype.It’s a fun thing to try, but I’m not sure it’s something I’d be rushing out to buy again.Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaNorthern Ireland power station wants to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland Latest Northern IrelandViewpointOpinionA lasting legacy for a remarkable teenArmagh pair among three sets of twins to star in musical adaption of The Parent TrapSt Patrick’s Day : Dublin celebrationsafter two-year Covid absencePO Ferries ‘unable to run services’ due to upcoming company announcementTyrone McKenna will continue to entertain and have fun with world title shot against Regis Prograis on the lineLatestRussian air strike appeared to target civilian building in Mariupol – CleverlyViewpointOpinionA lasting legacy for a remarkable teenWar in Ukraine will take global economic toll, OECD warnsArmagh pair among three sets of twins to star in musical adaption of The Parent TrapDegree course dropout rates fall to lowest on record,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireSam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailStormont is on course to waste at least £m — and perhaps as much as £m — over the next  years due to its failure to find a way to spend Treasury funding made available to Northern Ireland for subsidising renewable heat.As revealed by the Belfastlast week, £m has already been wasted in this way and there is no sign of the Department for the Economy producing an alternative proposal for how it can spend the money.However, new figures show the vast scale of the waste aheadthe situation remains unaltered. In response to a Freedom of Information request from the Renewable Heat Association— which represents most RHI claimants — the department said that it was now on course to underspend by around £m. However, those figures only cover expenditure until , yet the GB RHI scheme — from whose budget Northern Ireland’s share of money for renewable heat is derived — has been extended and will not now close until .Based on that longer duration for the GB scheme, RHANI has calculated that Northern Ireland’s underspend may be closer to £m.Read MoreCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidiesThe department said that it “will explore the potential to utilise any available [Treasury] funds in support of alternative or additional actions to decarbonise heat”. However, there is still no suggestion that this work has reached an advanced stage nor even that it will be possible because the Executive remains unable to decide how to handle existing RHI claimants.Those claimants were promised unalterable payments for  years but once the calamitous scale of the RHI overspend became apparent, Stormont abandoned that promise and retrospectively slashed their payments, meaning the actual overspend was £.m.That decision made them far less well rewarded than their counterparts in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland, which recently launched its own version of RHI — putting Northern Irish businesses at a competitive disadvantage.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Sources within the DUP suggest that the party is split on how to handle the situation. Former leader Arlene Foster — the minister who set up the disastrous scheme but then said she was “accountable but not responsible” for the mess which followed — had endorsed a policy of throwing all RHI claimants out of the scheme, paying them a fraction of what they were originally promised as compensation. Sinn Fein has also endorsed this policy, but other DUP figures believe it is unfair to those claimants who entered the scheme in good faith, took on huge loans at the suggestion of its minister and government officials, and who did not abuse RHI.There is another factor which might explain the decision not to spend such a vast sum of money. The retrospective cuts to subsidies which had been guaranteed were immediately challenged in court by claimants. However, that process has moved tortoise-like over the last five years and has not yet gone to the Supreme Court. That case is just one of several RHI legal actions, the outcome of which the department cannot be certain.It may be that its decision not to launch a new green heat scheme is a way of hedging against the possibility that the original scheme is reinstated and it faces a vast compensation bill.Whatever the reason, it is having an increasingly stark impact. As oil and gas prices soar, renewables are among the cheapest alternatives — but have high up-front costs to install, which is why subsidies are in place where across the UK and Ireland.RHANI executive chairman Andrew Trimble said: “If civil servants had not removed  words from the national legislation on renewable heat when the NI legislation was implemented, then today we would have a strong, sustainable, environmentally friendly renewable heat sector. We would be contributing to our pathway to net zero and have a vastly reduced reliance on fossil fuels — with their polluting emissions reduced by %.”He said that Stormont could solve the problem by reinstating the missing  words — essentially replicating the GB scheme, with cost controls, something he said “could solve the political problems that Stormont and the department have created for themselves and for the people of Northern Ireland”.Mr Trimble highlighted that in , a Commons committee inquiry branded the department’s actions “a raw deal”, but the department had repeatedly failed to help genuine claimants suffering as a result of their broken promises.Related topicsDepartment for the EconomyThe Executive OfficeArlene FosterSinn FéinClimate ChangeMore On Department for the EconomyGreens urge Northern Ireland Executive to help Kilroot power station to stop using Russian coal‘No plans’ to ration NI’s energy over supply fearsDepartment​​ of Economy slammed over Covid spend PremiumEpidemic Belfast: Podcast takes a scalpel to our medical pastCost of living crisis leads to .% slump in retail footfallMost ReadFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestBBC’s Emma Vardy is on the crest of a wave... and set to tie the knot at Co Antrim fairytale castleA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland Latest PoliticsNew Belfast council chief John Walsh will earn up to £k a yearMLA seeks to investigate recent surge in fuel prices amid Kilroot Power Station confusionAlex KaneOpinionDisagreements are only going to grow as unionism heads into election in fractured stateNorthern Ireland births, deaths and marriages can now be registered in IrishMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ bodyLatestWestle announce two shows for Belfast later this year as part of new tourOfficial Platinum Jubilee emblem souvenirs go on saleFears of major job losses as PO Ferries suspends sailingsKate Garraway to host new ITV Saturday morning show‘Why  Why  Why ’ Ukraine’s Mariupol descends into despair,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

AMFacebookTwitterEmailA rider has raised more than £, with the help of the equestrian world to fund an aid-giving trip to Poland after seeing two dead Ukrainian children on the news.Stephen Barnes, , from Manchester, galvanised the equestrian community, which has donated money to support his trip to the Ukraine-Poland border with volunteers.The group will be delivering horse boxes full of aid such as blankets, clothes and first aid equipment while they also plan to bring back those with an eligible visa to enter the UK under the new Homes for Ukraine refugee scheme, or transport them to a place of refuge anywhere in Europe.Mr Barnes told the PA news agency he was motivated to begin fundraising for the trip after seeing a mother and her two children die whilst trying to flee the war-torn country via a humanitarian corridor.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ad .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ffb-c-bd-ab-cbaeab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ad .ece AUTOCROP w

said.“They were traditionally, nicely dressed and they were with their mother, and they had been killed by a blast, but they were just asleep on the floor.”Mr Barnes said he “does not care” how long he needs to be on the road for, as his building consultancy business, Black Cat, can continue to run without him.Nine horse boxes will depart from Knutsford, Cheshire at .pm on Thursday before boarding a am boat journey to Holland on Stella Line ferries, which has been donated as a free journey by the company.The horse boxes have beds, heating, cooking facilities and bathrooms, and Mr Barnes has already been in talks with owners of holiday homes in France and Portugal who may be able to house some refugees.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP h

Barnes said that he grew up in the equestrian community and has been inspired by how much support his campaign has received.“The idea was simply that I come from a world of a equestrian people,” he said. “And they are pretty much all very determined, self-driven, ‘can-do’ sort of people – who are completely unmanageable by the way!“They’re all brilliant people and they all generally have big trucks and can move big horses and people around the country.”As well as money, the Ukraine Equestrian Relief group is also looking for volunteers to offer their homes as short-term stopover points on the journey to and from the border, and for anybody who can assist with translations.”Mr Barnes posted on his GoFundMe page: “There is no time like the present. People and their children are walking, freezing and hiding from shelling. We do something great that affects generations to come.”To keep updated with Mr Barnes’ efforts, visit www.gofundme f ukraine-equestrian-relief.

I was held responsible for a smell… but I’m just a child.”Mr Khan wrote: “As Mayor, I have been clear that London’s police service must have the trust and confidence of the public they serve and incidents such as those experienced by Child Q, not only foster distrust in the Met but actively hamper any efforts to police by consent.”He said that Londoners “rightly expect their police service to act with the utmost integrity at all times”, and that where standards are not met, they need to have trust that those charged with investigating the police would “leave no stone unturned”.“This case has understandably caused widespread concern amongst the public and it is important that all allegations are thoroughly investigated, and that all relevant sources of information are taken into account,” he said.

Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany and the Low Countries have demonstrated the ability to deliver that we can learn from locally.Cllr Enright praised the support of Ards and North Down Council which has already delivered  miles of walk as far south as Comber.ldquoThis -mile section of trail is designed to encourage more people to learn about the history of North Down and Ards, including the impact the area had in a European context through the links with Columbanus, he explained.ldquoOur big challenge will be to engage with Newry Mourne and Down Council to deal with their huge gaps in the Saint Patrickrsquos and Ulster Ways.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government department and Housing Executive their desire that these discussions should be centred on the interests of the Shirley community, with the outcome safeguarding the future of the cherished

controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been urged to do all it can to quickly deliver Newcastlersquos new multi-million pound leisure complex.The appeal was issued by the local authorityrsquos chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Fin tasic with formation of new angling club  ","story":"A NEW course angling club has been formed in Downpatrick.Known as Quoile Angling Club, the organisation is holding its inaugural meeting this Friday night at Murphyrsquos Bar in the town at pm, with an open invitation extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting this Friday evening, members will adopt a constitution and select a new management committee.

The funding provided by the Department means it will be assisting Downpatrick in a very substantive way over the next few years.ldquoThe planning has been completed. The next stage is to get things done.

He was inch-perfect through the morningrsquos slippery conditions, quickly building up a sizeable advantage and catching his rivals on the hop.This continued his fine form after the local driver also won the opening stages.In the space of two stages, he had amassed a lead of more than  seconds ndash a huge margin on the single venue event.From there, he managed his lead and with the sun shining, Greer powered home in his Citroen C to eventually win by . seconds and claim another maximum points haul in his bid for this yearrsquos championship spoils.ldquoIt was a brilliant day, said Greer.ldquoThe car was faultless and was really well suited to the event. We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three. McGarrity tried hard to fight back but in the drying conditions, McLaughlin had the edge in his Fiesta WRC.He was really enjoying himself and an attempt to secure the fastest time on the final stage saw him come to within one-tenth of a second of rally winner Greer.ldquoHersquos a machine, said McLaughlin.ldquoI was really hoping for a fastest stage time. I just wish we had started the day as good as we finished it.Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson had to be content with third overall in their Skoda. Their stage two overshoot potentially cost them a position but they still secured an armful of points for their McGrady Insurance NI Championship campaign.ldquoIt was a silly mistake on the second stage, said McGarrity.ldquoThen we had a small misfire on the last stage but it is what it is.Joe McGonigle and Ciaran Geaney clipped a bale and damaged the front wing of their Fiesta on stage two but they survived to tell the tale.Seventh after the test, they climbed back up the order to secure fourth overall ahead of Joe and Ashleen Hegarty, who were lucky to escape a high-speed spin on stage four.ldquoWe were using new tyres and the car broke away from me at high speed, explained Hegarty.ldquoWe went over a few trackside tyres and ended up on the grass.Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson would have been in the mix too but they took a wrong route on stage five and were handed a stage maximum. Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

It is little surprise that workers are concerned that their pay packets may not be sufficient in this time of soaring prices.One alarming aspect of this current monetary headache is that one of the traditional levers of control of inflation is rendered almost redundant at this time — rising interest rates. Only weeks ago a gradual such increase was expected, indeed assumed, to be happening over the coming months. But such a move would be so unpalatable as to be almost impossible in the context of burdened families grappling with devastating fuel bills.No-one wants lectures on pay restraint from Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, given that he earns £, a year. But it is not unreasonable to be concerned that across-the-board high pay rises could lead to a s-style spiral. High inflation, among other things, will decimate cash savings.There are urgent measures that can be done to help families such as scrapping VAT on energy billsand encouraging those who can work from home to do so, to save on their fuel expense.

Antrim, from Scotland this morning.“Until then, services from PO will not be running and we are advising travellers of alternative arrangements.”Stormont Assembly members whose constituency incorporates the port of Larne have expressed concern about the potential implications for the PO route to Cairnryan in Scotland.East Antrim MLA John Stewart, who has relatives who work at the port, said staff were uncertain about what would be announced.“The information is being nothing more than drip-fed to them,” the Ulster Unionist MLA told BBC Radio Ulster.He said it was a “worrying” development.“For the staff, for Larne port itself, particularly for the local effect here, and also for businesses and passengers that regularly use that service, it’s an invaluable local service over to Cairnryan and I think this news will be deeply worrying for all of them, especially in the absence of any concrete information as to what the long-term strategy is going to be.”East Antrim MLA John Stewart added: “What we need to hear from the company is that the sailing from Larne to Cairnryan is set in stone and will continue to be there, and they’re going to honour and keep the staff there and continue that sailing because it’s such an integral part of the local economy here.”His constituency counterpart, Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson, said: “It’s very disturbing, of course, for passengers but particularly concerning for the port of Larne in my constituency of East Antrim.“Larne port is pivotal for tonnes and tonnes of load freight that comes through that port on a daily basis.”Mr Dickson said the issue needed attention at the top of government.“It should be people like Grant Shapps the transport minister making an announcement because this is affecting the whole of the United Kingdom,” he told Radio Ulster.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Kymin in Beach Road is currently empty, but the Vale of Glamorgan council plans to run the building in a similar way to the Pier Pavilion, which it took over last year and refurbished.The Vale council previously let the Kymin to Penarth Town Council. But after a funding dispute, the lease ended and the Vale planned to sell off the building on a long lease, possibly as a restaurant or hotel.After a public backlash the council performed a U-turn last summer and dropped the plans. Now council bosses have suggested the building could be used for business meetings, open-air theatre, community fairs, weddings, and food festivals.Plans are already underway to host productions this summer of Peter Pan, Pirates of Penzance, and a Midsummer Night’s Dream. Council bosses welcomed the progress during a cabinet meeting on Monday, March .Cllr Kathyrn McCaffer, cabinet member for leisure, arts and culture, said the initial refurbishment work includes making the building safe and protected from wind and rain.She said: “We’re investing to make sure the building stays watertight and secure and is fit for purpose. We have a great relationship with a couple of local community groups who are already using the grounds of the Kymin, which is really encouraging.”Since the Pavilion reopened in April last year, after the council took it over, the building has brought in an extra £, income from the cafe, cinema screenings, weddings and art sales. The building has hosted events for Halloween, Christmas, arts and crafts, and carols.Cllr Peter King, cabinet member for neighbourhood services and transport, said the council took the Pavilion on from the charity which used to run it “at the most challenging time” yet now the building is making money for the council.He said: “The previous organisation failed to make a financial success of operating the Pavilion and frankly ended in a bit of a mess. It defaulted back to us as the landlord, and it came to us at the most challenging time you could imagine for any business or organisation..remove“And yet we have managed to turn things around, despite all those restraints of lockdown, and we’re reporting what can only be described as a successful community facility—and one that has produced a financial surplus.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She is a member of GSD Dog Club of Wales Training Club and receives support from professional mentors.Luca, who also qualied for Crufts  but failed the last challenge, was unstoppable in this years event - winning the competition and being awarded a trophy.“It’s a long process to qualy for Crufts,” said husband Mr Heath.“This is the second time Luca has qualied and he nailed everything this year.“He came in first place and was asked to stay behind to do a demonstration in the ring – we are really happy.“It was a long day, but worthwhile.”The trio travelled from Wenvoe and stayed at a bed and breakfast ahead of the event so Luca could have his time to shine in the prestigious competition.“I was the most nervous watching the final exercise,” added Mr Heath.“Carolyn doesn’t look at the score as she doesn’t want the pressure so – although she knew she was doing well – she didn’t know that she was winning.”Although the trio had to head back to Wenvoe after the competition, Mr Heath had anticipated the day would go well so had a bottle ready – meaning Ms Heath could enjoy a celebratory bubbly on their travels.Due to Luca’s success in Crufts  he has automatically qualied for the event in .And –all goes as planned – it is hoped that Luca and his female friend Eva, will be welcoming puppies into the world later this year and that Eva will qualy for Crufts in a few years time. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: PA Twickenham Stadium, London​Saturday, February .pmNew Wales flanker Jac Morgan admits playing at Twickenham next week would be special given the historic rugby rivalry between England and Wales.Morgan won his first cap on Saturday as reigning Six Nations champions Wales bounced back from a Dublin drubbing against Ireland to beat Scotland - in Cardf.The Welsh-speaking Ospreys openside says he was so nervous before kick-off that he almost forgot the words of the national anthem ‘Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau’.“It’s always a dream to play for your country from a young age,” said the -year-old.“Growing up England is one of the biggest games with the rivalry between the two countries over the years.“Everybody knows how big the game is with the history between the two sides.\"Morgan produced an impressive debut display last weekend, as Wales revived their Six Nations title hopes before heading to Twickenham next Saturday.Courtney Lawes has resumed full training in time to reinforce the middle phase of England’s Guinness Six Nations title push.Lawes was unable to play in the opening two rounds of the tournament because of concussion but has now completed histo play protocols and comes into contention to face Wales next Saturday..removeDefence coach, Anthony Seibold, said: \"Courtney trained fully today , which is obviously really good news for himself and England. He looked sharp.\"Meanwhile, Wasps flanker Jack Willis is set to make his first appearance in a year after finally recovering from the serious knee injury sustained against Italy at Twickenham in the  championship.England v Wales Six Nations: How to watch on TV, live streamThe England v Wales Six Nations match kicks off at .pm on Saturday, February .You can watch coverage on ITV or live stream the game via ITV Hub.Alternatively,you cant make it to a screen, you can also listen live on BBC Radio  Live Sports Extra. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Headquartered in Birmingham, George Best Belfast City Airport is to become its second main base of operations. And it is reported that flights to a number of destinations are set to go on sale next week. Flybe CEO, Dave Pflieger, said: “Next week is going to be an exciting time for customers and communities that have been waiting to hear from us about low fares, new routes, and new destinations—all of which are being timed to coincide with the restart of the economy and ato normality after two dficult years for all. “As you’ve heard, our team has been working hard for over a year and a half to bring customers a new airline that people will love, and we are particularly excited to be flying to Belfast City Airport and serving Northern Ireland. “Once we start flying from Birmingham, Belfast, and many other cities in the UK and EU, we are confident that a new and improved Flybe will provide customers with great value, more choices, and the opportunity to quickly and more conveniently visit loved ones, go on holiday, and more easily visit customers or attend important meetings. “Given that goal, Flybe hopes to do its part to help communities across the country bounce back from the dramatic impact of the global pandemic.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cdecfacaceabf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_befdfaabffabffcf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
