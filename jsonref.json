Last year, it proposed chopping £2 million from its libraries spending over two years, a funding reduction of two-thirds. The biggest cut of £1.05m was due to hit at the start of this coming financial year, until the council came up with what could be described as a novel idea.At a January meeting, a rescue package was proposed — erting funds from the council’s health and wellbeing budget to reduce the impact of the cuts on libraries. If the decision is ratified by the full meeting of the council’s executive on 4 March, it will mean injecting £700,000 into libraries, dramatically reducing the proposed cuts for the coming financial year and alleviating fears voiced by library campaigners and staff — who took strike action in October in protest against the cuts — that job losses and branch closures would be inevitable.Not only that, but the proposal on the table is for a recurring annual investment of that amount. If the decision is passed, then it will be a firm commitment and recognition by Bradford that libraries really are medicine for the soul – an inspiration for other authorities who facing savage library cuts.This week, Bradford politan District Council announced it was opening a consultation process for residents to give their views on the proposals and was also “exploring wider funding opportunities which would help support ambitions for a sustainable library service which meets the needs of local communities”.Councillor Susan Hinchcliffe, the leader of Bradford Council who will be presiding over the meeting next month, said the council’s focus “has to be on preventing ill-health in the first place, not dealing with it after the fact. And libraries have a big part to play in that.”“A huge number of the decisions we have to make at the council are about the health and wellbeing of people,” Hinchcliffe said. “Books are of course hugely important in libraries but there are many other aspects. The social interaction they provide is vital, especially for isolated people. They host clubs and events, they provide information and access to the internet.“We are remodelling how libraries work to meet the needs of the health agenda. Libraries are symbols of community and we have to be passionate about libraries and how they serve these communities.”“We interviewed two large groups, library users and non-users, and library usage was associated with higher levels of happiness and satisfaction,” Lawton said. “What’s often important to councils in these situations is the cultural value of a service ... We know libraries are beneficial anecdotally, but with our research we tried to look at how valuable they were in monetary terms, by asking people if they would hypothetically be prepared to pay for the services they receive.”This was the first time he had heard of a local authority putting funds from health provision into library services, he continued, but “Bradford putting money from its health and wellbeing budget into libraries does seem to suggest they are subscribing to our research”.Users at Bradford’s City Library tended to agree. “Libraries have tangible benefits for health,” said regular library user Paul Davies, “especially mental health.”Another regular library user, Frances, who lives in nearby Shipley agreed. “I would say that libraries are definitely good for health and wellbeing,” she said. “Not just in terms of reading and what that gives you, but also the social aspect of visiting a library, especially for people who live on their own.”A Bradford libraries card holder since the 1970s, she welcomed the initiative: “It’s entirely appropriate to spend money from the health and wellbeing budget on libraries. I see a lot of people using the libraries. Some go in just to borrow books, some go in to use the computers, some go in for a chat with a friendly face.“If we didn’t have libraries, I think people would be very miserable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f747052b547b61293d90ac40b7f8afd6934ff524/0_135_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d92c98fe8c16aff969d84f24e1e67ce","title":"the volunteer by jack fairweather review witold pilecki auschwitz","story":"Humanity’s limits are laid bare in the gripping story of a Polish soldier who chronicled Hitler’s genocide from withinThis year will mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war, probably the most revisited period of history in history.

After Poland was invaded and ided by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in September 1939 – with its political, professional and officer class ruthlessly annihilated by both powers – Pilecki joined the Polish underground.He laboured at first under the illusion that Poland’s French and British allies would soon come to his country’s rescue. As these hopes began to subside, he was recommended by a rival officer for the mission to infiltrate a concentration camp the Germans had established in southern Poland called Auschwitz. His near-impossible task was to set up and maintain an underground resistance.Though little was known at that time about the workings of the camp, there was at least enough information to suggest that it was effectively a suicide mission. Nonetheless Pilecki took up the challenge, got himself arrested in an SS round-up and was duly transported to Auschwitz.On his arrival, he was beaten and brutalised as part of an initiation process to force new prisoners to adjust to the hell they had entered. “Let none of you imagine that he will ever leave this place alive,” one of the senior Germans warned the prisoners, explaining that their food rations had been calculated to enable six weeks’ survival and, if anyone outlasted that, it meant that they were stealing and would be duly punished.There have been many testaments to the cruelties of Auschwitz, but few have followed its development from concentration camp to extermination camp with such gripping descriptive power.The very idea of solidarity was total anathema to the Auschwitz regime, which was a kind of microcosm in extreme of Nazi philosophy put into practice.For inmates to demonstrate shared values, trust and selflessness was not just to invite torture and death, but to challenge the very process of dehumanisation that the Nazis demanded all prisoners undergo. Yet somehow Pilecki was able to convey these higher qualities in such a manner that others wanted to follow his example.It cost many their lives, but for over two and a half years Pilecki stuck to his mission through unimaginable suffering, a near-fatal bout of typhus and the constant threat of exposure. He built an underground resistance movement and smuggled out in-depth reports from the frontline of Hitler’s race war.Unlike many of his fellow Polish Catholics, Pilecki was also alert to the plight of the Jews. He was among the first to alert the world to the gas chambers that awaited Jewish men, women and children who were transported to Auschwitz.But to what end? Pilecki begged for the camp to be targeted by allied bombers and pleaded the case for an attack by the Polish underground. None of it made any difference. The allies maintained that all efforts should be focused on winning the war, and that to highlight the mass murder of Jews in Auschwitz would, perversely, foster antisemitism. Meanwhile the Polish underground – itself riddled with virulent antisemitism – decided that any assault on the camp would be too dangerous.Eventually, when he realised that his meticulous accounts of the unfolding genocide had left both his and the world’s leaders unmoved, Pilecki staged a breathtaking escape in 1943, during which he was shot. Nevertheless he got away and made it to Warsaw, where he fought bravely in the doomed uprising of August-October 1944, which cost more than 100,000 Polish lives.He was then taken to a prison camp in Germany, was saved by the Americans from death at the hands of the SS, and after a brief recuperation in Italy, he chose to return to Poland, which had been occupied by the Soviets.Pilecki remained loyal to the Polish government in exile in the UK, but a communist puppet regime was installed by Stalin. It arrested 80,000 members of the Polish underground, among them Pilecki, who was executed in 1948 following a show trial in which he was portrayed as a traitor. His courageous exploits were wiped from history by the communists, and it wasn’t until after the collapse of the eastern bloc in 1989 that Pilecki could be discussed again.This vivid portrait is of someone who is no way a larger-than-life or conspicuous hero, but instead a man with a remarkable sense of faith, despite the most inhospitable conditions, in human decency.Pilecki’s tale is well known in Poland, but now finally this towering figure has been brought to the attention of a much wider global audience. Fairweather’s book is an impressive feat of research, organised by a keen moral intelligence and written with the elegance and pace of a first-rate thriller.• The Volunteer: The True Story of the Resistance Hero Who Infiltrated Auschwitz by Jack Fairweather is published by WH Allen (£7.99).

In the 1960s, distaste for the treatment of “non-standard” vocabulary such as “ain’t” in Merriam-Webster’s Third International Dictionary was so vociferous that a hostile takeover of the company was attempted, and after that failed a competitor dictionary was founded. The price of used copies of the 1934 Second International Dictionary skyrocketed as customers rejected the dictionary’s approach to controversial usages.Another kind of case has emerged in recent days. Tottenham Hotspur has shown the yellow card to the Oxford English Dictionary for its new definitions of the words “yid” and “yiddo”. While the dictionary records both words as usually offensive terms for Jewish people, it now also describes them as nicknames for Spurs supporters, noting that the fan-directed usage is “originally and frequently derogatory and offensive, though also often as a self-designation”. The club has issued a statement saying that it has “never accommodated” use of the “Y-word”, and considers the definition “misleading”.Every time people say that a word or meaning “doesn’t belong” in a dictionary, lexicographers sigh a little. Dictionary writers share a vocation to record a particular language as it is used rather than how anyone, whether Peta or Spurs, would like it to be used. This is especially true of the OED, which is designed as a tool for the historical study of the language, recording evidence of changes in English words and meanings over the past thousand years. It’s worth noting that at this point Oxford Dictionaries has included the “Spurs supporter” definition of the Y-words only in the OED, a subscription-based service intended for those engaged in historical and linguistic research. It does not appear in its web-searchable online products, which are designed for everyday use by people learning or using the language.There are good reasons for wanting a warts-and-all record of the language. Though offensive words may be pushed out of use, they will survive in many of the places where they have been printed, including in journalism, fiction, correspondence and diaries. Future readers will be as puzzled by the slang of our time as we might be by the mention of yellow boys (gold coins) in Dickens, and dictionaries should be there to help. There’s also good reason for recording that Y-words are used by different people to derogate and to celebrate, regardless of what is authorised by Tottenham Hotspur. If dictionaries record the usage of only the authorities, the voices of the people are lost. Should “yid” be alleged as a weapon in a hate-speech crime, it will be important to have a record of, and to appreciate, the complexity of its history.That doesn’t mean that the protests are unwarranted or unwelcome. Despite any temptation to sigh and point to the academic motivations for recording such words, protests are productive for the improvement of dictionaries. They are particularly welcome where they concern the dignity of those to whom the words refer. This is nothing new. In 1924, the Jewish Chronicle took issue with Oxford Dictionaries’ inclusion of a derogatory use of the word Jew to mean “an unscrupulous usurer”, prompting the dictionary to label the usage as “opprobrious” and to provide explanatory notes about the history of the word’s usage, as well as its meanings. Last year, the #RedefineBlack campaign led Dictionary to reorganise its entry for “black”. Lexicographers, while well intentioned, often come from groups that suffer less from the slinging of slurs. Whether or not the OED’s definition of Y-words will ever please Spurs, at least a conversation is happening about what dictionaries could do better.• Lynne Murphy is professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex and author of The Prodigal Tongue: the Love–Hate Relationship between British and American English"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4b00e49be059567230569addc0c74f1ee38781/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d544ee1318cc013ef824a5db4997ad6c 940w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of clash","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘clash’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘clash’.Share your photos of what clash means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 19 February at 10am.

We know graduates tend do better and earn more in full-time employment.More 18-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds are going to university than ever before, but they remain three times less likely than those from wealthier backgrounds to do so. To narrow that gap, universities must do more to help them.It is essential that the university admissions system is easy for students to understand . That’s why, at Universities UK, we’ve launched a fair admissions review group, which will analyse whether offer-making from UK universities is fit for purpose.To inform the group’s work, Savanta ComRes polled students and recent graduates asking, among other things, whether they felt the system is fair and their views on whether it would be better to apply to university after receiving exam grades.The main complaint is that unhelpful careers advice is undermining the current process. It is therefore the job of universities, colleges, schools, employers and the government to work together to provide better support for all applicants. Failing to do so means we risk talent slipping through the cracks.Universities have a responsibility to explain and to justify why and how places are awarded. In particular, the use of unconditional offers – an offer that is made without requiring a specific entry grade – is being carefully considered in this review. The new universities minister, Michelle Donelan, is among those politicians to question their use in the past.The group will also scrutinise the impact of these offers on exam performance, how students decide which university to attend, and on their future career prospects. Offers must be made in the best interests of students, without limiting ambition or adversely influencing course choices.Universities are trying hard to reach applicants in disadvantaged communities by awarding them “contextual” offers, which reflect inidual circumstances and potential. The polling shows, though, that greater transparency and better communication is needed.The polling also shows that almost one in three applicants feel that not having their exam results before applying to university is a challenge and, significantly, more than half of recent applicants believe universities and colleges should only make offers after grades have been received.The benefits and disadvantages to students of switching to a post-qualification system will be explored in the review. It’s a complicated question: moving the admissions process to after students have received their results could substantially change school, college and university timetabling.It is a frequently repeated myth that such a system is the norm across the world. But in most countries, including Australia, France, Germany and Canada, students apply to university several months before they take their final exams and don’t get their offers until after their exam results are known – similar to in the UK. Again, educators in these countries stress the importance of good quality careers advice.Universities are working with students, schools, colleges, Ucas and the government to ensure the system in the UK is the best it can be. The students and graduates have spoken. We must make sure we listen and take actions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d6fe9a31de394c19dbeab78889e1c90792b210b/0_152_3591_2155/master/3591.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b7fe954bc7b627004d17a20090bfdaf","title":"uk universities face pressure to reform admissions process","story":"Exclusive: minority candidates complain of poor careers advice and time-consuming processBritish universities are taking a hard look at changes to their admissions procedures for undergraduates, after evidence that significant numbers of disadvantaged and ethnic minority students are dissatisfied with the current system. A survey of university applicants commissioned by vice-chancellors and seen by the  found that many black and other ethnic minority candidates, as well as those from families without a history of studying in higher education, complained of obstacles during their applications, including poor careers advice and a time-consuming process.The poll of 1,500 recent applicants to higher education, conducted by Savanta ComRes and commissioned by the Universities UK (UUK) group, found that fewer than two-thirds said the system works well, with black and minority ethnic applicants the most likely to support a radical overhaul such as a shift to applications after A-level grades are published.Julia Buckingham, the vice-chancellor of the University of Brunel University London and president of UUK, said: “On the whole university admissions are seen as fair but all students must have faith in the system and receive careers advice to help them make the best decisions about what and where to study.“It is the job of universities, colleges, employers, schools and the government to work together to fill the gaps in good quality careers advice for applicants, and particularly to disadvantaged groups.”The survey was commissioned by the group representing 137 universities in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for its admissions review group that is considering recommendations to improve the system.The Office for Students, the higher education regulator in England, is conducting its own review of admissions, a move endorsed by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, who said: “I am glad the OfS is looking at whether it would be in students’ interests to apply for their university place after they have their A-level results.”Most students receive offers of places that are conditional on achieving certain A-level grades, based on the grades predicted by their teachers. But critics say grade predictions are notoriously unreliable, and conditional offers leave students and universities in the dark for several months.Fifty-six per cent said universities and colleges should make offers only after receiving students’ results, and the same proportion backed a more radical shift to begin applications after A-level results, “even if the term started later”.Students who were the first from their families to apply to higher education, and those from black and ethnic minority backgrounds, were more likely to support post-A-level admissions.Clare Marchant, the chief executive of Ucas said: “It’s welcome news that most students agree the current application process is fair, and that the clear majority of applicants felt supported when applying, particularly by Ucas.”Marchant said her organisation was “already exploring innovative reforms to the admissions process, including how changing when students receive offers could bring benefits”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52c8b65bd7c2066f46d49dc8f18aa010d0699c44/0_19_3979_2388/master/3979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bf723194cf2a069f4f210e9609eee36","title":"canal istanbul erdogans crazy plan to plot route between black and marmara seas","story":"Proposed route slices through a major drinking water source and an important stop for migratory birds To the west of Istanbul, between the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea, lie erse landscapes of forest, farms, marshes and ancient settlements. Following a curving line from north to south would connect you through the Terkos Lake, Sazlıdere stream and reservoir and Küçükçekmece lagoon, important water sources for migratory birds – not to mention the city’s residents.This line, however, is also the path of Kanal İstanbul, a $12.6bn(£9.7bn) mega-infrastructure plan described by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as his “crazy project” when he first mentioned the idea in 2011.Kanal İstanbul, approved by the environment ministry last month, would be a 45km (28 mile) shipping canal joining the Black Sea to the Marmara, running parallel to the Bosphorus strait, which already cuts through the centre of Istanbul. The government says the canal is needed to reduce water traffic through the city.Critics – who include the mayor of Istanbul – warn of a great environmental cost, including the potential ecological destruction of the Marmara Sea. There is a delicate ecological balance between the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea, currently connected by the Bosphorus strait.“The salinity of Black Sea is less than Marmara Sea, and the organic content of Black Sea is much higher than that of Marmara Sea,” says Cevahir Efe Akçelik, Istanbul secretary of the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects.Because the Black Sea is 50cm higher than the Marmara, both the level and salinity density would change if the two were connected by the canal.Not only that, the flow of cellular organisms into the Marmara would eat up extra oxygen.The loss of oxygen could see bacteria and other organisms create a sulphurous gas, the scent of which could spread across Istanbul like rotten eggs. And there are fears it could wipe out life in the Marmara entirely.“Some oceanographers say 30 years later there will be no oxygen left in the Marmara Sea. It’s a really harmful and dangerous project.” said AkçelikOne section also directly threatens Istanbul’s water supply. Terkos Lake and Sazlıdere reservoir provide a quarter of the city’s drinking water the city has drawn water from the lake since the Roman period and it has always been regarded symbolically as Istanbul’s main water source.Should those reserves be lost, Akçelik says, there is no alternative water source on the European side of Istanbul. Instead the government would have to pump water from the Sakarya River, deep on the Asian side.That would be much more expensive. It also carries health hazards, given the river passes through Turkey’s capital, Ankara, and through polluted industrial areas to reach the Black Sea.The canal would also destroy Küçükçekmece lagoon, which in turn could see hundreds of different species vanish, scientists warn. The lagoon is an important stop for migratory birds, particularly the Cetti’s warbler, grey heron, eastern imperial eagle and the flamingo, who all lay their eggs in Küçükçekmece.“If you lose that lake, you lose not only a drinking water source, but a really important ecology,” Akçelik says.The ministry of environment and urbanisation opened the project to public consultation. More than 70,000 people signed a petition against it.The mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, who is affiliated with Turkey’s main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), has been at loggerheads over the project with Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).İmamoğlu has started to campaign publicly against the canal, and the municipality is taking legal action to halt construction.According to the head of the zoning and urbanisation department, Gürkan Akgün, the objections made by public institutions, non-governmental organisations and residents have been ignored.“The north end of Istanbul is the life support system for all of us,” he says. “It all will disappear irreversibly with this project.”He argues that the ministry’s report contains “erroneous assumptions and insufficient analytical surveys” and says the city is appealing the decision.Greenpeace has submitted an appeal of its own.“In many respects, Istanbul, one of the most important and unique cities in the world, is going to be thrown into disaster with this unpredictable project,” says Greenpeace’s Mediterranean program director, Deniz Bayram.The national government and the city’s ministry for environment and urbanisation did not respond to requests for comment. Erdoğan has said there is no alternative to the Kanal İstanbul project for limiting traffic through the Bosphorus, and claimed all appropriate environmental and technical surveys have been undertaken.The Bosphorus strait is an internationally important shipping route. Around 48,000 ships pass through its waters annually, including oil tankers and war ships. The government claims there are risks posed by ships carrying dangerous goods.The construction of new petroleum and natural gas pipelines between countries has meant less reliance on ships and tankers to transport resources.Accidents have been falling as well, according to municipal officials, who point to improvements in maritime transport and shipping sector technology. “For many years, we have not encountered a serious accident in the Bosphorus and I hope we will not in the future,” Akgün says.Akçelik says he believes the true long-term aim of the canal, rather than easing shipping traffic, is to create a major infrastructure project north of the city to spur development.“The main idea is creating a new city in northern Istanbul,” Akçelik explained.Akgün agrees and says he believes the new works will significantly disrupt the area’s climate. “The construction areas to be formed around it will transform into an urban heat island, changing the temperature, humidity, evaporation and wind regimes in a very short time,” he says.“Considering all these points, it becomes clearer what kind of an environmental disaster we are facing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/911083f20bc708665f0966f385d5720433e258f7/103_573_4132_2481/master/4132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09d105e213230c57e313f5130d1b7a07","title":"shipping pollution regulations could harm food chain","story":"Use of ‘scrubbers’ to cut air pollution increases pollutants pumped into sea, UN report saysNew shipping pollution regulations introduced earlier this year could harm humans by contaminating fish and crustaceans with toxins, according to an internal report compiled by the International Maritime Organization and obtained by the .In the report the IMO, the United Nations agency responsible for regulating shipping, says that there is insufficient “toxicity data” to be able to assess the risk to humans caused by the increased use of exhaust gas cleaning systems, which are also known as “scrubbers”.These devices reduce the amount of pollution emitted into the air by ships, but the cheapest and most popular models dramatically increase the amount of pollutants pumped directly into the sea.Shipping companies have spent more than $12bn (£9.2bn) fitting thousands of scrubbers on vessels around the world in order to meet new air pollution standards that were introduced on 1 January 2020.Some of the pollutants deemed most concerning by experts that are pumped into the sea by scrubbers are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have been linked to skin, lung, bladder, liver and stomach cancers.Critics say IMO member states should have conducted thorough risk assessments before deciding to allow the use of scrubbers under the new legislation.Lucy Gilliam, a campaigner for the Brussels-based NGO Transport \u0026amp Environment, says the IMO should stop the use of scrubbers until it can answer key questions about how discharges may affect health.“Ships should not be allowed to use scrubbers if the IMO has no idea what the consequences will be for human health and food chain contamination,” she said.“The surge in scrubber use means that increasing amounts of PAHs will accumulate in sediment over time, and no one knows what the impact on human health will be.“It is going to have an impact on the food chain and, as things stand, we have no reliable information about when safe threshold limits will be breached.”Christopher Elliott, a professor at the Institute for Global Food Security at Queen’s University Belfast, believes the effect of bioaccumulation of PAHs in the food chain is a worrying issue.“Any increase in PAHs at the bottom of the food chain can have a negative impact on human health over the long term, damaging immune systems and potentially increasing susceptibility to cancer,” he said.Shipping companies have repeatedly said that they have commissioned rigorous studies to test pollutants discharged by scrubbers.Earlier this year a study commissioned by Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) Europe, the world’s largest cruise industry trade association, concluded that “exhaust gas cleaning systems have a limited impact on water quality”.In March last year Carnival, the world’s biggest cruise company, published a study that described scrubbers as “a safe and effective” way of complying with the recently implemented regulations for cleaner air emissions.The Clean Shipping Alliance, a lobby group for companies that have invested in exhaust gas cleaning technology, says it believes that sufficient research has been conducted and discharges from the devices are safe for marine ecosystems.“There is well-documented evidence relating to the composition of scrubber washwater,” a spokesperson said.However, in the IMO’s new internal report it criticises the existing body of research that been published based on analysis of chemical discharge from the devices, saying that some of the existing studies cannot be trusted.“In a number of reports, no basic information was provided either on the sampling techniques, or on the quality assurance and control of the analytical methods used,” it says.“Lack of all this information put a great uncertainty on a number of presented results and the quality of the provided data could not be fully judged and trusted.”Gilliam says many of the existing studies looking at chemical discharges from scrubbers have been done by entities that benefit financially from the use of them.“In some cases they are commissioning studies by independent groups, but the samples are being collected by their own staff,” she said.“How do we know exactly where they are taking the sample from, at what time, at what engine load? We don’t have those answers. It can’t be regarded as rigorous, independent, peer-reviewed research.“We don’t know if this will be a health crisis in 20 or 30 years, because proper research just hasn’t been done.”A spokeswoman for CLIA said: “Cruise lines are committed to environmental stewardship and have invested more than £16bn in ships with new technologies and cleaner fuels to reduce air emissions and achieve greater energy efficiencies.In October, the British Ports Association warned that the use of scrubbers by shipping companies could render some UK ports unusable by contaminating sediment and increasing the cost of dredging.The IMO is due to discuss future regulation of scrubbers at a meeting starting on Monday.

It looked like a slug on a quilted bed cover, but tasted absolutely right: plump where it should be, and wobbly at the centre a crepe of eggs cooked in butter. I ate it quickly and didn’t wash the plate.Thinking about it, a three-egg omelette is the thing I make most often for myself when I am alone, which at this particular point in my life (older mother of a young child partner also working at home) isn’t often. I know this phase will pass and morph into another, but for now my favourite solitary meals involve ignoring all leftovers related to recipe testing, and minimum cooking: the omelette (surely the most delicious thing you can make in one minute) or scrambled egg or three slices of country bread, halved and topped with 100g sliced cheese (mozzarella, fontina, provola or scamorza), six anchovies and a zigzag of olive oil, then baked in the oven at 180C160C fangas 4 for 10 minutes so the cheese melts down the sides like an oversized tablecloth. Whether you call them crostini con formaggio e alici or cheese and anchovies on toast, eat them while they are so hot they sizzle in your mouth.Then there is my joy at not cooking at all no pots or heat, not even a plate: just wine and cheese. Depending on the day, it might be careful slices of aged and veined cheeses with appropriate crackers, or two Babybel and the last hard inch of pecorino meant for grating.“Revel” is a word my friend Jacky used when we talked about cooking for one and eating alone. After years of jigsawing meals around her full-time job as a social worker and the demands of four other people, years that gave her immense pleasure but also pain, she revels in every aspect of her solitary meals, from the first glance at a recipe book to the last bite. She also thrives on cooking for her family and many friends the meals she prepares for charity and a local refuge. But the real revel is in the hours she spends pottering in her kitchen, braising a rabbit or making a pie food that can be eaten exactly when she feels like it, along with a glass of wine and her book, maybe her phone camera – after all, Instagram can be a place of conviviality.Madison’s chapter Saved by Sardines and Rescued by Pasta makes me think of another younger me, eating tinned sardines on toast in London then, at 33, a few months after arriving in Rome, discovering what happens when you fry a sliced onion gently in three tablespoons of oil and a knob of butter until it looks like mush, add a few anchovy fillets so it turns into a grey sludge, then toss the whole shebang with long pasta. It is like stumbling into comfortable umami I often still make it for two, although now I think about it, I wonder if, like omelette or pure cheese, it was more delicious when I cooked and ate it alone.I have ordered Madison’s book, for the recipes and stories that cover all areas of cooking for one, the practical and pragmatic, fantastical and funny, but also for the dedication at the beginning. It feels like a motto for life: “This book is dedicated to all who find themselves alone at the table.

Race is irrelevant to the issues that I was discussing and I deeply regret what I said. I sincerely hope that the players accept my apology.”Kick It Out had called on the BBC to take “effective action” after Ramage, a former Derby and Watford midfielder, said on the programme, which has since been edited and re-uploaded online: “When I look at certain players, their body language, their stance, the way they act, you just feel, hold on a minute, he needs pulling down a peg or two.“So I’d probably say that about all the young black lads, all the young advice if they wanted it, that, you know, it’s about, when you are struggling for form, you are going through a sticky patch, it’s about going back to basics, working hard, and doing the right things.”On Sunday the 22-year-old Derby defender Max Lowe flagged up Ramage’s comments on social media, saying he “decided to speak out on behalf of all black footballers at Derby County”. Lowe added on Instagram: “Racial ignorance, stereotyping and intolerance negatively affects the image of impressionable young footballers and creates an unnecessary ide in society. I am also disappointed that a public service broadcaster did not step in to ask the analyst to explain his reasoning or to distance themselves from these archaic thoughts.”The Kick It Out chairman, Sanjay Bhandari, said: “These comments are shocking and the views expressed are the kind of thoughtless racist stereotypes that we heard 50 years ago. We do not expect to hear them lazily trotted out in 2020. I expect effective action to be taken by the BBC. I support Max Lowe’s comments and we offer our support to Max, Jayden Bogle and the young Derby players.”Derby released a statement in which they said they had been in contact with the BBC, underlining that the club “take comments like these extremely seriously, we do not tolerate them, and stand shoulder to shoulder, together as one with all our players”. The club’s specialist first-team coach, Liam Rosenior, a member of manager Phillip Cocu’s backroom staff, said the comments were “unacceptable”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0d18af5dc3f0b2b254e8302c92996cb1944cdd6/0_49_2820_1692/master/2820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ece98021c0f1848500c718217751d1","title":"chelseas mario pasalic set to join atalanta for 125m in summer","story":"Mario Pasalic is poised to make a permanent move to Atalanta from Chelsea in the summer after the Italian side agreed to take up the €15m (£12.5m) option to buy the Croatian midfielder.Pasalic moved to Stamford Bridge in 2014 from Hajduk Split but has yet to make a single appearance for Chelsea having previously been on loan at Elche, Monaco, Milan and Spartak Moscow.The 25-year-old joined Atalanta on an initial season-long loan in 2018 and helped Gian Piero Gasperini’s side to qualify for this season’s Champions League before agreeing to move to Lombardy for a second season last summer having signed a new contract at Chelsea until 2022.Pasalic scored the winning goal in Atalanta’s 2-1 win against Roma on Saturday which cemented their grip on fourth place in Serie A and it is understood that an agreement for his permanent transfer is now in place.Chelsea have already agreed a €40m (£33.6m) deal, potentially rising to €44m, with Ajax for the Morocco midfielder Hakim Ziyech.

Burnley and Newcastle are not the sternest tests of a side’s defence – and Arsenal rode their luck in both instances – but there is no doubt David Luiz and co have begun to look notably more assured. Fourteen years after the departure of the club’s last top-class centre-back in Sol Campbell, could this be the beginnings of a new, level-headed Arsenal backline? Mikel Arteta’s first 11 games in charge have seen his side concede eight goals the equivalent figure from Emery’s final 11 games was 23. Goals at the other end have declined, too, by about a third, but that’s a small price to pay if it lessens the embarrassing clownishness at the back. Arteta was recruited because of his affiliation with thrilling possession football. His best work so far has been to revive the old spirit of “boring, boring Arsenal”. Alex HessOn a day when Son Heung-min scored his 50th Premier League goal, Aston Villa recorded an unwanted half-century of their own. “It is a lot,” said Dean Smith, whose side have the worst defensive record in the ision after conceding 50. They are actually on course to score 50, the sort of total that should inoculate a side against relegation but their fate may rest on whether enterprising attacking or porous defending proves the greater factor. There are times, though, when Villa feel luckless. Bjorn Engels, who played an unfortunate role in two goals, was only playing because Tyrone Mings was struck down with tonsillitis. Arguably their best win of the campaign, at Burnley, was marred by season‑ending injuries to Tom Heaton and Wesley. John McGinn, brilliant against Tottenham in August, has not played since Christmas. It is just as well Jack Grealish looks to be indestructible. Richard JollyNorwich are getting better. They remain bottom, seven points from safety with four points from their last five games. The “little miracle” Daniel Farke likes to talk about does not seem likely and after defeat against Liverpool even he seemed to frame it as a bonus. Expectation management is at work but relegation will not bring an end to the Norwich project and Farke, should he stay on next term, will know his young team are stronger than they were when last in the Championship. Norwich have become more competitive the longer the season has gone on. They still play their football but the gaps in defence are narrower and there are fewer careless actions. Against the leaders they gave one of their most mature displays this season. Norwich may be going down but the project is continuing. Paul MacInnesTraditional programmes may not carry quite the same appeal as they once did but Sean Dyche still pays attention to them. Dyche said his Burnley players thrived on “disparaging remarks” in the Southampton programme, which pinpointed left-back Charlie Taylor as a weakness and highlighted that only Sheffield United have played more long balls per game. “And they are definitely not long ball,” Dyche said. “I told the lads: ‘There you go, that’s what they think of you.’ They read it, disparaging remarks about Charlie Taylor of all people. I think his form’s probably worth mentioning with the national side – not just yet – but I think he’s one they’ll be keeping a background check on. It’s always lovely when they give you that little edge I love that. ‘They only do this, they only do that.’ It’s like fuel – you beauty!” Ben FisherHamza Choudhury’s suspension for the home game against Manchester City on Saturday leaves Brendan Rodgers with a tactical dilemma. If Wilfred Ndidi is still not fully recovered from knee surgery and Nampalys Mendy remains injured, Leicester could revert to the three at the back with the combative Choudhury unavailable after his red card in the goalless draw at Wolves on Friday. Dennis Praet and Youri Tielemans did not look a natural midfield pairing in the Carabao Cup semi-final against Aston Villa, so Ryan Bennett or Wes Morgan could join Caglar Soyuncu and Jonny Evans as Leicester seek to rub salt into City’s wounds. Choudhury has been an energetic force for Leicester behind James Maddison and Tielemans but his rashness remains a trait he needs to eradicate, even if his first yellow card at Molineux for a foul on Raúl Jiménez was harsh. Peter LansleyIf it’s drama you want, then there’s no shortage at either end of the Championship, with both the title race and the relegation scrap providing plenty of seat-of-the-pants excitement. But if it’s fun you want, look no further than the team in 16th, QPR, who are surely English football’s most gloriously maddening team to support right now. Only two teams in the ision have scored more and only one team has conceded more than the west Londoners, who were in typically rollercoaster form at home to Stoke, going 2-0 down within half an hour before roaring back to win 4-2. As has become customary this season, a defence resembling Swiss cheese was bailed out of trouble by the twinkle-toed magic of the men on their flanks: Eberechi Eze and Bright Osayi-Samuel, natural born entertainers who make playing football look like an effortless pleasure. Both were on the scoresheet, the latter seeming to defy the rules of physics to lash the ball home from an absurd angle, and both players’ agents can expect to field plenty of calls this summer. QPR are unlikely to go up, so the temptation for the players to listen to offers will be strong. Then again, why go somewhere new when you’re having this much fun? AHErnesto Valverde coveted Antoine Griezmann for a long time only to spend a lot of money signing him with no apparent plan to extract the maximum from his talent. What Barcelona needed was a centre-forward to succeed Luis Suárez, except Valverde refused to let Griezmann to become that, instead forcing him into a left-wing role for which he was entirely unsuited. Now, though – with Valverde gone and Suárez injured – Griezmann can ensconce, and against Getafe he showed his potential, applying a lovely finish to Lionel Messi’s through-ball before contributing to Sergi Roberto’s winner. Perhaps – in time – Saturday’s win will mark a turning point in his career at Camp Nou.

Then I started to get “screen time” notifications. This unwanted weekly intrusion was sobering: on average, I was using my phone for nearly four hours a day. And the bulk of that time was spent on social media.When I really thought about it, I could see how this came to be. Setting an alarm before bed turned into scrolling through Twitter for an hour checking the weather became a marathon Reddit session. All roads led back to social media, even if I’d picked up my phone with entirely different intentions.I was eager, then, to see if an Amazon Echo Dot with Alexa could change my behaviour. Reflecting on how I found myself inevitably in a social media hole whenever I used my phone, it felt logical that, if I could replace tasks I used my phone for with the smart speaker, I’d avoid wandering on to Twitter and ultimately prevent unnecessary phone time.When the Echo Dot arrived, I decided that the living room would be the best place for it. Setting it up was a doddle, although it did involve using my phone, but before long I had linked the speaker with my music streaming provider, my Audible account and had even saved recipes that I thought I might try during the week. That first evening – seduced by the allure of shiny new technology – I sat for two hours listening to podcasts on the sofa, my phone forgotten.Conscious that the Echo wasn’t there just to feed my true crime addiction, I scoped around to find out some other skills and tasks I could assign it. To prevent myself from waking up and looking up the news, weather and tube status on my phone, I decided to programme a morning routine – a set of Alexa’s commands triggered by a simple voice instruction. The next morning while having breakfast, I asked Alexa to “start my day”. First came a fact of the day, then the weather and finally the ’s news briefing, a 30-minute cut of the latest news, sport and reviews, read to you by Alexa.It was all very useful, but, being in a shared flat, having Alexa tell me the weather forecast out loud while my flatmate slept felt a little inconsiderate. And while I wish I had 30 minutes to spare to listen to a podcast each morning before leaving the house, it’s just not realistic. Like with any new addition to your home, Alexa and I needed to adjust.Diving back into the app, I reprogrammed my morning routine, replacing the news briefing with a mindfulness exercise. To get the news, I decided that I would use the  skill. The next morning, after being told that it was Britney Spears’s 38th birthday that day, I luxuriated in a minute’s worth of mindfulness, bathed in the soundscape of a forest, before asking Alexa to read me the headlines. When it was time to leave, I realised that I had only used my phone that morning to tweet a happy birthday to Ms Spears. Win.My phone use in the evening, however, was still a problem. Flatsharing means you have to be flexible, and arriving home after my flatmate I soon understood that it would be impossible to sit in the living room all night listening to audiobooks or podcasts or even doing Harry Potter trivia. I could hardly ask him to turn the TV off and vacate our shared space so I could listen to an episode of My Dad Wrote a Porno. So, the decision was made: I would take Alexa to my bedroom.Not only could I now set up alarms to wake me up, but I could also add little reminders each morning to water the plants or to not forget my phone charger before leaving the house without Alexa booming them out at 8am and freaking my housemate out. In the evenings, I found that I didn’t mind being holed up in my bedroom, as Alexa read me audiobooks and podcasts. As someone who needs background noise to sleep, I found that dozing off to a podcast was far more comfortable than wearing headphones in bed. I even added a sleep timer so that I didn’t miss anything when I eventually fell asleep.Most notable, though, was how easily using the Echo and Alexa replaced my phone. Sure, I was still drawn into the odd scour of Reddit and Twitter, but just asking Alexa to play me the latest episode of What Makes a Killer (yes, I know, not really light bedtime listening) instead of scoping it out on my phone before ultimately playing it while simultaneously bingeing on social media, meant I gave the podcast my full attention. I also didn’t fall asleep with my phone in my bed, either.It’s probably still too early to say that the Echo and Alexa have changed my life. But without doubt, it has shifted my behaviours. I make time in the mornings for mindfulness and engage properly, instead of just getting riled up by the latest scandal on Twitter. Mostly, though, it’s made me realise how much easier it is to find time in the day to take for yourself when you’re not sucked into hours scrolling on your phone. This week alone I’ve made my way through five hours of a new audiobook and my morning mindfulness is a revelation.Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7254b6c6fd2c10f6d43157c2a76d3a4338bc946/0_34_1824_1094/master/1824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ae6c49a63204d76f1d8404f7b558358","title":"the people who matchmake their own parents looking back it was a rash thing to do","story":"With the numbers of single over-50s growing, playing cupid for separated or bereaved parents can seem tempting. But there are potential pitfalls ...When he was widowed after almost 35 years of marriage, it seemed as if my dad might not find anyone else to love again. My mum was his first relationship, he had no experience of dating and, even if he had, the dating ecosystem had changed out of all recognition since the days of my parents’ romance in the 70s. There were, of course, plenty of dating apps, subscription sites, singles’ activities and old-fashioned blind dates to contend with, but for him the choice was overwhelming. He would rather have settled for being alone.Five years after my mum’s death, however, with our father’s stubborn reluctance well and truly established, my brother and I decided to take matters into our own hands. Taking advantage of the effects of the wine we had drunk for his birthday dinner, we downloaded Lumen – an app marketed as “Tinder for over-50s” – to his phone. Then we did an impromptu photoshoot and employed our best copywriting skills to sell him to the lucky ladies in a 10-mile vicinity.It took him a while to overcome the initial awkwardness of online messaging. He struggled to understand that most people prefer some informal chat before meeting up: he scared off some suitors by suggesting coffee straight away. After a few months of swiping, messaging and meeting up with strangers, he met someone who is now his partner.With the numbers of single over-50s growing in the UK, matchmaking for our parents is an increasingly likely prospect, and one that can be just as fraught as it is rewarding. For Jack (not his real name), the sudden death of his father in 2007 was devastating for him and his 58-year-old mother. “My mother suddenly found herself a widow, and since my dad was the love of her life, she was so lonely – and terrified at the idea of spending retirement on her own,” he says. “So I suggested internet dating, which was in its infancy at the time, but she wouldn’t contemplate it – she was too shy and I think she thought it may have been a bit vulgar, too.” Feeling helpless at the prospect of his mother’s solitary retirement, Jack decided to set up a page on a dating site without her knowing.“Looking back, it was a very rash thing to do,” he says. “I even set her age as a couple of years younger than she was because she has always looked young. But, just before I was going to launch the page, my girlfriend at the time persuaded me I had to come clean, and at least get my mum’s blessing.” There followed an awkward confession during which Jack persuaded his mum to give it a try for two months. “She went on a few dates, but didn’t meet anyone special and let her membership lapse,” he says. “That was until she checked back on her email alerts from the site and saw a photo of a widower, James, and decided to pay the £7 rejoining fee.”Jack was none the wiser until his mum introduced James to him as her boyfriend four months later. “I was shocked and elated,” he says. “They were clearly such a good match, and had hit it off after meeting up through the site. They ended up getting married in 2012, and my mum says that was the best £7 she ever spent. I’m glad I signed her up in the first place and that she was brave enough to take the plunge.”Julia Godoy’s parents had been separated for more than 10 years when, last summer, her 50-year-old mother decided to venture into the online dating world. “She was very close to a man, and they had a complicated relationship in which they were friends. But perhaps she hoped for more, and then in the summer she found out he was in a relationship and had been lying to her the whole time. She felt really betrayed and lost,” says Godoy. “But a friend of hers who is always on dating apps persuaded her to give it a try to help her move on and take back some control.”Godoy helped her mother, who was living in France, set up a profile on the French website Meetic, where she had paid for a three-month membership. Then they waited for the dates to start rolling in. “I was so surprised when she decided to sign up because my mum is usually shy and very private,” Godoy says. “But I’m glad she has taken that step.” Now two months into her subscription, her mum has been on a handful of dates. “She still feels awkward about it all, but I want her to keep trying,” she says. “It must all be very intimidating – even I have never signed up to any of the apps or sites – but all you can do is just be supportive to your parents and help them move on when they’re ready. I feel optimistic that she will meet someone soon – she deserves to.”Before internet dating was an option, Gillian Ross was matchmaking her widowed mother in a more traditional manner. In 1976, Ross, then 16, worked as a bookkeeper in an office where she met an older colleague, Derek. “I was hopeless at my job, and Derek was always so kind in offering to help me,” she says. “Sometimes, when I was walking home, he would see me and offer me a lift in his car and if we saw my mum walking back from her job at a nearby bacon factory, he’d stop to pick her up.” Initially assuming Derek was married because of the neat packed lunch he would bring into work each day, Ross found out that he was orced with two children, and encouraged her mum to set up a date with him.Ross says: “I was writing out Christmas cards that year, and I said to my mum: ‘Why don’t we send one to Derek and ask him to come for a drink on Boxing Day?’ But she was too embarrassed, and refused. She thought it would be too pushy.” Ross sent the card anyway, and when Derek replied saying he would love to come, the relationship began. “They started going out together every other weekend and getting to know each other – it was so nice to just see her happy with someone. My mum had a really rough time of it. My father died when I was seven and my brother not much older, so she was left with a massive responsibility. Then Derek came along and it was another lease of life for her – I think she’d given up before then.”The couple remained together for 38 years before Derek died of a brain tumour in 2015. “When Derek was dying, he took my hand and said: ‘Your mum gave me the happiest years of my life – I didn’t start living until I met her.’ They stayed as in love as when they had first met, and it was lovely to know that I had picked him out all those years ago. He really became a dad to me, too.”Ross is herself orced, and often finds her two children now trying to act as matchmaker for her. “People say to me: ‘Why don’t you go on Tinder?’ But I’m just not into it – I’d much rather meet people the old-fashioned way,” she says. “My kids have tried to set me up a couple of times because they would like to see me with someone again, but most of the decent men seem to be taken. If I don’t meet anyone, that’s fine by me, but, to be honest, I wish they would set me up more!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e460cabe205ee0b7a04f438880c42029253602/123_0_4684_2812/master/4684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c028194f426cd57626976192b11b85e7","title":"from ganafest to notte bianca your guide to maltas arts and culture festivals in 2020","story":"With events taking place across all seasons, there’s always a good time to visit MaltaThere’s always something happening in action-packed Malta.

Sources told the  that people such as the Any Questions presenter, Chris Mason, and the Today programme presenter Nick Robinson had also been approached.Stig Abell, the editor of the Times Literary Supplement who is coordinating the launch of the station, said he hoped Pienaar’s hiring would help make it a “new destination for those people hungry for quality reporting and trusted, expert analysis”.There has been disquiet in the BBC that the station’s launch is being coordinated by Abell, who is helping to poach many of the BBC’s leading presenters while still regularly presenting Radio 4’s flagship arts programme Front Row.The new station will be available on national DAB digital radio but will also try to take advantage of the rapid growth of smart speakers which are making it easier to try new stations.The BBC is under enormous pressure, both structurally and politically. Over the weekend the Murdoch-owned Sunday Times ran an anonymous Downing Street briefing which said the licence fee was under threat and that the government wanted to shut down or sell off every BBC radio station other than Radio 3 and Radio 4.Pienaar said: “It’s been a huge pleasure and a great privilege to work at the Beeb. Now, I couldn’t be more thrilled about joining the greatest and oldest title in journalism – in such a new and ambitious project on the digital frontline. The guiding aim is to offer listeners high quality discussion and analysis of the stories and issues of the day, and make it a compelling, enjoyable listen. I can’t wait to get started.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/468186b2d54eb48f0c1f87fd85c9fd0a217e2c70/0_312_4682_2809/master/4682.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e2345177f494275584beb904c1c3551","title":"uk defending press freedom amal clooney","story":"Special UK envoy on media freedom says Trump has inspired authoritarian leaders to try to silence journalistsAmal Clooney, the UK government’s special envoy on media freedom, has renewed her criticism of Donald Trump as she acknowledged that her ambitious plans to combat media repression globally were being launched into a “pretty bleak” human rights landscape.The British-Lebanese barrister told the  that simple arguments about accountability for genocide that should have been easy to win at the UN security council had fallen foul of UN ision.“At the same time some of the language used about journalists by authoritarian leaders is inspired by the language that came from the US president,” she said in an interview.Clooney, who has repeatedly harangued Trump for his attacks on the media, said there had also been times when she would have preferred British ministers to do more to voice their concern about press freedom when meeting autocrats such as the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.But Clooney – and the phalanx of media and human rights lawyers she has helped assemble – are far from daunted. “This is certainly not the time to give up the fight,” she said.Clooney also believes that the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is personally determined to take up the proposals she unveiled this week in London alongside a panel of senior international lawyers, including the former president of the UK’s supreme court David Neuberger.A statutory instrument, potentially the most important of this parliament, is expected shortly setting out precisely how the UK government will introduce targeted sanctions against iniduals, including ministers, abusing human rights, such as the right to free expression. The US and Canada have already introduced such measures, and the European Union announced in December it was looking at similar proposals.The aim is to target anyone throwing journalists in jail, or shutting down the internet. Whole countries will not be targeted, but iniduals, ministers, prosecutors and jailers. The chief sanction will be confiscation of assets and travel bans.It is a novel approach building on the so-called Magnitsky human rights sanctions first introduced in the US.“If world leaders are becoming more united and more innovative in finding ways to silence the press, shouldn’t we as defenders of the press do the same,” Clooney said.She acknowledged that the current state of global media suppression would make things difficult for the Foreign Office (FCO). Foreign governments, discovering their communications minister has been sanctioned, are hardly likely to rush to strike a trade deal with the UK.“We recognise diplomatically it could be awkward for a foreign minister in their first day in office to impose sanctions on scores of other ministers of foreign affairs due to human rights abuses,” she said.Clooney’s report has proposed ways to embolden ministers by protecting them from the likely diplomatic flak. Ending what has been described as “the silence of democracies” over media repression was more likely, she argued, if the democracies all spoke with one voice. “There is safety in numbers, so that is why this needs international sign-up,” something the FCO is seeking with its pledge on media freedom, which has been signed by more than 30 countries.Canada felt badly isolated when Saudi Arabia launched economic reprisals for Ottawa’s sanctions after the killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.The report suggested that UK ministers could be shielded from diplomatic fallout by the establishment of an independent national body that made objective recommendations on the most egregious cases of media repression. Clooney’s panel now wants to look at the consular assistance diplomats give threatened journalists, the possibility of emergency visas to rescue journalists at risk, requiring countries to open trials of reporters, and improving obligations on countries to be transparent about the arrest of journalists.Reports by the high-level panel are due this year on the improper curtailment of free speech via sedition laws, overly broad hate speech laws, anti-terrorism laws and the misuse of concepts such as fake news.Time will tell how far Raab is prepared to run with this campaign. “Autocrats hold dear control of the media,” Clooney said – and there are many modern autocrats in the world that would resent a western country telling them to un-muzzle their media.“All I can do as a human rights lawyer is keep trying to move an issue further up the to-do list and keep pushing so where a country is wavering they are more likely to do something than not. But yes, it is a pretty bleak landscape when it comes to accountability for human rights abuses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bcbecfdd0de662825c7deaa6efb8a390e7346a0/0_83_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05e4f257fba0ace14cfa4d9f243b7120","title":"halfords left me with locked lump of useless metal","story":"I bought the Halfords Advanced 6 Drawer Tool Cabinet for my husband for Christmas.

How much will HS2 affect property prices in the Midlands and the north? Will they become expensive like the south-east? Also, why are property prices in the south-east so high compared with the Midlands and the north and will this change in the future?REA The short answer to all your questions is: I don’t know. What I do know is that when somewhere stands to benefit from a large-scale improvement in transport links – especially to London - property prices tend to go up. For example, when the original London to Oxford bit of the M40 was extended from Oxford to Birmingham back in 1991, my home town of Warwick saw – if not a though-the-roof increase in property prices – then at least a bit of a surge. By being less than 10 minutes from the motorway, the town had become an easy commute to Birmingham and, at a push, a reasonable weekly commute to London. A decade or so later, property prices saw a further positive blip when Chiltern Railways reopened Warwick station which provided access to its cheap train services from Birmingham Snowshill to London Marylebone. It’s doubtful, however, whether the coming of HS2 will see a further surge in property prices, largely because Warwick won’t have close access to HS2 services."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65401c519881f0f2926f2ab839592431ed8b776e/0_50_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc2fa29ea3cc2771a96bf091955c722","title":"uk housing boom leads to 2500 jump in asking prices","story":"Britain’s property market is in the grip of fresh boom, according to Rightmove, with asking prices jumping by more than £2,500 over the past month alone.The average asking price for a home rose to £309,399 in February, £40 shy of its all-time record, said Rightmove. Buyers and sellers have been invigorated by renewed economic confidence, described as the “Boris bounce”, it added.In its most exuberant market report since the last boom in 2014-15, Rightmove predicted price records would be broken in the spring and hesitant buyers should “now jump in”.Rightmove director, Miles Shipside, said: “There is a boom in buyer activity outstripping the rise in the number of new sellers, which we expect to lead to a series of new price records starting next month. Buyers who had been hesitating and waiting for the greater political certainty following the election outcome may be paying a higher price but they can now jump into the spring market with renewed confidence.”Others said the “Boris bounce” could flag after the budget and if wrangling over EU trade negotiations saps confidence in the economy. Lucian Cook, the head of Savills residential research, said: “Our own agents are reporting that the vast majority of buyers remain unwilling to increase their budgets. Accordingly, our advice remains that sellers need to remain pragmatic on price, particularly given some of the uncertainty around an impending budget, the first of the new government.”Edward Heaton, a buying agent who acts for investors at the top end of the UK market, said: “I would expect any house price rises we’ve seen in January to flatten by the latter part of the year, as attention will inevitably turn to ‘deal or no deal’. Trade negotiations will unavoidably affect market confidence – both in attracting foreign investors and housebuilders who rely on European materials.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d3acf286e52a5aabd485cb954622141b6ab642/0_1155_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b04f0375fe432844886c1ffd81b062be","title":"what is it like to come out late in life podcast","story":"Nicholas McInerny, a writer, came out as gay aged 45 and after nearly 20 years of marriage.

Uppal said the immigration officials did not cite any reason for denying Abrahams entry and revoking her visa, a copy of which, valid until October 2020, was shared with the news agency. A spokesman for India’s foreign ministry did not immediately comment.Abrahams has been a member of parliament for Oldham East and Saddleworth since 2011 and was on a two-day personal trip to India, she said in a statement.“I tried to establish why the visa had been revoked and if I could get a ‘visa on arrival’ but no one seemed to know,” she said. “Even the person who seemed to be in charge said he didn’t know and was really sorry about what had happened.“So now I am just waiting to be deported ... unless the Indian government has a change of heart. I’m prepared to let the fact that I’ve been treated like a criminal go, and I hope they will let me visit my family and friends.”Abrahams has been an outspoken critic of the Indian government stripping Kashmir of its semi-autonomy last August, demoting it from a state to a federal territory.Shortly after the changes to Kashmir’s status were passed by India’s parliament, Abrahams wrote a letter to India’s high commissioner to the UK, saying the action “betrays the trust of the people” of Kashmir.India took more than 20 foreign diplomats on a visit to Kashmir last week, the second such trip organised in the last six months by the Hindu nationalist government led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi.Access to the region remains tight, with no foreign journalists allowed in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/656d0d289ae1de0e0e41560728f3a5822ccd1e73/0_50_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59963121011a8f18a70ae9df0dcf8315","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThe total confirmed number of Covid-19 cases in China has risen. to 70,548, after the health ministry reported 2,048 new cases in its Monday update.New deaths totalled 105, bringing the total number of fatalities in China to 1,770.

They won’t, however, be taking in the baroque majesty of the Grand Place or savouring the local culinary treats. Instead, they will be preparing for that most infamous of events, a “four shirter”, to use the clothes-packing gauge adopted by male diplomats to measure the length and horror of EU leaders’ summits in the Belgian capital. The thorny subject this time around? Money. And the problem? Britain.The UK’s withdrawal from the European Union has left a huge €75bn (£62bn) hole in the bloc’s budget for the next seven years, 2021 to 2027. “And now we are fighting like ferrets in a sack,” said one EU diplomat with a sigh.Covering items ranging from agricultural subsidies to science programmes and the EU’s efforts to combat the climate emergency, the new multi-annual financial framework (MFF) needs to be agreed by the leaders and an increasingly unpredictable European parliament before the end of the year. Without agreement, everything risks grinding to a halt in just nine months’ time, including the flow of cohesion funds, the cash dedicated to supporting the poorest member states.Budget discussions in Brussels are always rancorous affairs. But this one is of a different order: everyone will have to pay more. No one wants to. EU capitals are bristling for a fight when they come to Brussels on Thursday for day one. Ominously for the diplomatic corps, an end date for the summit has not been fixed, but four days of talking are on the cards.Then there are the “Friends of Cohesion”. “The Friends of Corruption, you mean?” spat one EU diplomat from a Frugal state.The 15 under the FoC flag are the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Estonia, Croatia, Malta, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, Portugal and Greece.The Frugals say that the commission’s €90bn in cuts to agriculture and cohesion funding are not enough. The FoC say they are being unfairly targeted and that the richer countries should cough up some more, setting up a battle between east and west.The debate is all the more toxic as the commission has proposed that cohesion funds should also, in the future, be conditional on member states respecting the rule of law. It is a red rag to the bulls in the nationalist governments of Hungary and Poland, who are already in a battle with Brussels over their judicial reforms, among other issues.Then there is France and Germany. Berlin’s main concern is that they don’t come out of it looking worse than the French. In Paris, the government just worries about how much cash is going to go to its farmers, said one senior EU official. The fragmentation of the national debates leaves it impossible to say what will happen, said a second official, with even Irish politics in turmoil following the election that has made Sinn Féin the second largest parliamentary party.Going in to the summit, the European council’s president, Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium, has been engaged in furious shuttle diplomacy around the capitals.“In this negotiation, we are not expecting member states to be happy, but the degree of dissatisfaction will be key,” said a senior EU official. “No chance,” responded a Frugal diplomat. “There is not a lot to say, except we won’t pay. And as the Rolling Stones song goes, ‘Time is on my side’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004c38e093af53e1cb3175e7f859247ccd0b1519/0_238_4977_2987/master/4977.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de1fefddf3b5e4abd7767d1284bfdaff","title":"coronavirus japan braces for hundreds more cases as another china city locked down","story":"Evacuations begin despite continued quarantine as Japan warns outbreak ‘entering new phase’Scores more people have tested positive for coronavirus onboard the stricken Princess Diamond cruise ship docked in Japan, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 454.The confirmation of 99 extra cases on the ship, which remains quarantined in Yokohama, comes as concern grows over possible infections among passengers from another cruise liner that docked in Cambodia last week.On Sunday, a traveller from the ship, the MS Westerdam, was confirmed to have the virus in Malaysia, just days after disembarking along with hundreds of other passengers. It is not clear how many travellers remain in Cambodia, or how many have already travelled on to further destinations.The Cambodian health ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The cruise operator, Holland America Line, told Reuters that guests who had left Cambodia would be “contacted by their local health department and be provided further information”. It is not clear if passengers will be asked to self-isolate once they return home. Meanwhile hundreds of American passengers on the Diamond Princess, where travellers have been mostly confined to their cabins since 3 February, have been flown back to the US. Fourteen passengers tested positive during the evacuation, the US State Department said.Australia said it would follow suit on Wednesday. Both countries have said citizens will face another two weeks of quarantine after arriving home. Forty American passengers who were diagnosed with the virus have already been transferred to hospitals in Japan.Some Diamond Princess passengers still on the ship face another two weeks in isolation if they have shared a cabin with someone who tests positive.The total number of people infected around the world climbed to more than 71,000 on Monday, including a further 2,048 confirmed cases in China, where the total number of deaths stands at 1,770. Five people have died outside China. Of the 105 deaths reported in China on Monday, 100 were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak.Cities in Hubei have stepped up measures to stop the virus’s spread. The city of Xiaogan – which has a population of nearly 5 million people and the second highest number of confirmed cases in China – ordered residents to stay in their homes or face detention of up to 10 days.State media reported that “all vehicles including motorcycles, electric bikes, bicycles and tricycles are prohibited from driving on the road”. Xiaogan, 70km from the city of Wuhan, has 3,279 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and has recorded 70 deaths.Japan, which has recorded one fatality, is the worst-affected country after China. Six new cases of the coronavirus were detected on Sunday, apart from those on the Diamond Princess. Overall, Japan has 413 confirmed cases of the virus, including one death, a woman in her 80s. With fresh cases emerging daily, the Japanese government has advised citizens to avoid mass gatherings, and on Monday cancelled celebrations for the Emperor’s birthday.A hospital near Tokyo said it was no longer accepting new patients because one of its nurses had tested positive for the virus after treating an infected patient who later died.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. It is also warning that travellers from Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand who develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath within 14 days of returning the UK should contact the NHS by phone.A member of the diagnosis team from Japan’s health ministry also tested positive for the disease, the ministry said. The virus’s spread in Japan has prompted calls for the government to speed up testing and offer clearer advice on when to seek medical help.Citing “circumstances”, theimperial household agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito’s public birthday address on 23 February, his first since his coronation last year. The event regularly attracts tens of thousands of people to the inner grounds of the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo. Tokyo’s marathon, scheduled for 1 March, was to feature 38,000 runners – but organisers said they had told participants from China to consider avoiding the event, Kyodo news agency said. The marathon doubles as a qualifying event for the Tokyo Olympics, preparations for which have already been disrupted by the Covid-19 crisis.Analysts also warned of potentially “huge” damage to Japan’s economy, saying the widening fallout from the virus was damaging output and tourism, undermining growth and risking pushing the country into recession.There is concern, too, over the growing number of reported cases in Japan involving people who have not visited China recently or knowingly had direct contact with people arriving from the country.“We agreed that the present situation represents the early stage of a domestic outbreak. This could progress further,” said Takaji Wakita, the chief of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, after the first meeting of a task force at the prime minister’s office.Pressure on Japan’s health services increased again on Monday with the arrival in Tokyo of a government-chartered flight carrying 65 Japanese nationals from Wuhan, bringing the total number repatriated from the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak to 763.Japan’s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, urged the public to avoid crowds and “non-essential gatherings”, including notoriously packed commuter trains and warned the country was “entering a new phase” in the outbreak of the virus.Koji Wada, a professor of public health at the International University of Health and Welfare, told the Asahi Shimbun: “There is the possibility that the infection may have spread to people well beyond the groups of patients who have been identified.”The government has made extra funds available for emergency countermeasures it says will be in place by the end of March. Employers in Japan are also starting to feel the effects of the outbreak. On Monday, Nippon  and Telephone, one of the country’s biggest firms, said it was urging its 200,000 group employees to work from home or stagger their commutes.Agencies contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2805fa8f325c3d66ac01acb2d54f330c614f523/0_290_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=840ad0a0427e7602c9db7d9d50980d90","title":"monday briefing mps condemn hounding of caroline flack","story":"Anger grows over media coverage of the late TV presenter’s court case … 600 flood warnings in Dennis deluge … James Taylor on hanging out with the Beatles Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and this is your run-down of the top stories this Monday.Media coverage of Caroline Flack has been widely condemned after the death of the Love Island presenter at the weekend, weeks before her trial for assaulting her partner was due to begin. Labour leadership hopeful Keir Starmer said some stories had “amplified” damaging social media posts about the 40-year-old star, who is believed to have taken her own life, and that he would push for ways to “ersify” the press if he was party leader. The Lib Dem MP Daisy Cooper said Flack had been “hounded” by parts of the media. The cabinet minister Grant Shapps, speaking on Sky News, argued that there was a duty of care for everybody involved in such cases, including the crown prosecution service, which has been criticised for pushing ahead with the assault case. Prominent barristers have also highlighted the strain placed on defendants in domestic abuse cases.ITV has also been criticised for failing to stand by Flack when the charges were laid as the case turns the spotlight back on tabloid intrusion. The station cancelled its episode of Love Island last night but will air a tribute to Flack tonight. Laura Whitmore, who succeeded Flack as host of Love Island, suggested on Five Live that media coverage had contributed to her friend’s death. Our TV writer Tim Jonze says Flack’s fragility and openness made her the perfect fit as Love Island host. And you can read our obituary of her here.Dennis deluge – A record number of flood warnings have been issued across the country after Storm Dennis lashed Britain with heavy rain and strong winds, inundating thousands of homes and causing widespread disruption to transport. Only a week after Storm Ciara brought a similar deluge, major incidents were declared in south Wales and parts of England. Pontypridd, north of Cardiff, was under water and faced being cut off for several days after roads were blocked by rising waters and landslides. Hundreds of flights were cancelled across Britain and roads and railways were submerged, with commuters facing a chaotic journey to work for the second Monday in a row.Japan warning – Japan is facing a deepening crisis over the coronavirus outbreak after 70 more cases were detected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, along with six new cases on the mainland. Experts say the country, which is the worst affected after China, is still in the “early stages” of the outbreak with 59 confirmed cases along with 355 on the ship. The health system is straining to cope, with a hospital near Tokyo forced to stop accepting new patients on Monday. The outbreak, which has now infected more than 71,000 people worldwide and killed 1,775, could also force the Tokyo Marathon set for 1 March to be scaled down. Chinese competitors have been asked to defer entry until next year. In China an activist has been arrested for criticising president Xi Jinping and in Hong Kong an armed gang has stolen a shipment of toilet rolls as panic-buying grips the city.Rogue surgeon – A private healthcare firm is under scrutiny after a second case emerged of a doctor who subjected patients to unnecessary operations that left many of them in pain. Spire Healthcare was already in the spotlight after an independent inquiry into rogue breast surgeon Ian Paterson, who is serving 20 years in jail for mistreating patients.  reveals today that Michael Walsh, a shoulder surgeon, was sacked by Spire after patients and colleagues raised concerns about his work. An investigation uncovered examples of Walsh harming patients by performing surgery on them unnecessarily or badly. Walsh has now retired.Cummings’ ‘misfit’ – Labour has called for a government adviser to be sacked after his controversial views about pregnancy, race and women’s sport came to light. Andrew Sabisky, 27, was made an adviser at No 10 as part of Dominic Cummings’ trawl for “misfits and weirdos” to help him shake up government. Sabisky wrote in 2014 that women should be forced to have contraception to stop unplanned pregnancies. He also claimed African Americans have a lower IQ than whites and compared women’s sport to the Paralympics. Jon Trickett, Labour’s shadow cabinet office minister, said there were “no words” to describe Sabisky’s appointment.Ring cycle – An American woman has hailed the “good people in the world” after a ring she lost 47 years ago in Portland, Maine was returned to her in the post after being unearthed by a metal detectorist in a forest in Finland. Debra McKenna expressed her delight at the return of the ring, which was given to her by her late husband when they were at high school. The ring was inscribed with the school’s name, a graduation date and her husband’s initials, enabling sheet metal worker Marko Saarinen to track her down.Tom Phillips, the ’s Latin America correspondent, is back in Venezuela a year after the start of a dramatic, but so far unsuccessful, attempt to topple Nicolás Maduro.

From next year, that gap widens to 67. Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAccording to a recent survey, of the 52 per cent of Irish workers who said they contributed to a pension, 41 per cent said they were not confident it would be enough to live off in retirement.Now that the dust has settled on the election – sort of – it’s as good a time as any to look at one of the topics that threatened to become hot during the course of the campaign. Pensions–- and yes, that might well be the first time pensions have ever been described as hot. Just how hot pensions were is open to debate, mind you. According to the exit poll published by The , it was the third most important issue people voted on. But just 8 per cent said pensions mattered most to them when voting and it was a long way behind housing and healthcare. Proposed changes to the pension age did not rate as an issue at all for the youngest voters.So if it mattered to only 8 per cent of voters and the election has now passed, can we forget about the topic until the next election? Sadly no. While pensions and election cycles are not easy bedfellows, with the former playing out over several decades and the latter focusing on what happens over a five-year period, the conversation must continue. Because no matter what your political persuasion is, we are living in troubling times because we are all living longer. While that is obviously good news, it is not problem-free. When German chancellor Otto Von Bismarck introduced a state pension in the 1860s, he set the age at 65, knowing full well that few of his countrymen would live to collect it. However, life expectancy in this part of the world has increased dramatically over the last 150 years and women can reasonably expect to live beyond 84 while – all things being equal – men will live until they hit 80. People in Ireland who turn 65 in 2020 will, on average, live 50 per cent longer than people who reached that age in 1970 and while there are now about five workers paying tax and PRSI for every retiree, in 30 years’ time that figure will be two workers per retiree.That is going to place a large burden on the State’s coffers in the years ahead and private pensions do not look like they are remotely ready to fill the gap. A study published earlier this month found that almost half of Ireland’s workers have no private pension, with 37 per cent of this cohort saying high rent and other day-to-day bills were making it impossible for them to afford it and almost one in five saying they did not know how to start a pension. According to the Matrix Recruitment pension survey, of the 52 per cent who said they contributed to a pension, 41 per cent said they were not confident it would be enough to live off in retirement, while 31 per cent responded that they simply didn’t know if their pension would be enough for retirement. And how much is enough? Probably more than you think. “Irish people’s standard of living has rocketed in the past 30 years and most people want to maintain their standard of living in retirement, so it is important to save enough to live comfortably,” says Sinéad McEvoy, pensions technical manager with Standard Life. “People owning pensions and, secondly, saving enough into them are two major issues in Ireland,” she says. If about half of the private sector has a pension and the average size is about €5,400 is that enough? No, McEvoy says. “This is not enough to live on even if you qualify for the maximum State pension of €12,900. A combined retirement income of €18,400 per annum will not stretch to paying the bills, running a car, holidays abroad,” she says. The cost of paying into a pension is a big concern for many people. “The more traditional reasons for people not starting a pension have been well documented,” says Breda Dooley of Matrix Recruitment. “Lack of knowledge, inertia and the assumption that a pension is not relevant are all issues people generally reference. “But now, according to these findings, we are seeing a significant number of people without a pension saying that they can’t afford it. What makes this more worrying is that with Ireland’s growing ageing population and the pension savings gap getting wider, the real question is: can people afford not to have a pension?”So when it comes to pensions what more do you need to know. Pricewatch asked some questions and then tried to answer them. Do I need a private pension? Will the State not look after me?Don’t count on it. The maximum State pension right now is €12,900 – that is just under €250 a week, so if you fancy spending your golden years taking round-the-world trips, trekking to Machu Picchu and doing other fun things you had put off earlier in life because of work and family commitments, then you will need more than that.How much more will I need?That depends. Most experts suggest that an “adequate” gross retirement income is about 50 per cent of gross pre-retirement income. So if you earn €80,000 on the day you retire, you need a pension income of €40,000. If you are one of the lucky ones who get the maximum State pension of €12,900 then you will need about €27,000. To get to that magic number you would need a fund of between €700,000 and €950,000.Is that a lot? It sounds like a lot.It is. Pricewatch asked asked the number-crunchers at Standard Life to work out how much we would need to put aside. To retire with a private pension of €19,500 a year – which is half the average industrial wage – at at age 68, you need to save a fund of €463,900. The cost of saving to get to the same final amount almost doubles every 10 years you delay saving. So if you start saving at 25 you will need to put aside a gross sum of €301 per month. With tax relief at the top rate, it is actually €164. If you start at 35, then you need to put aside €519 a month before tax, which works out at €283 with the reliefs in place. And if you start at 45 then the monthly gross savings come in at €969, which is €529 with tax relief. The above excludes the maximum State pension of €12,900. If you combine it with the €19,500, you get an annual income of €32,400, which is close to the average person’s desired retirement income of about €35,000. There’s a big difference between starting at 25 and 45?Yep: every 10 years that you delay starting saving means you double the cost of how much you need to put away to get to the same place when you retire.When will I get the State pension?Well isn’t that the €13,000 question. As it stands the qualifying age for the old-age pension is 66 but it will rise to 67 in 2021 and then 68 in 2028, with a jobseeker’s payment for those who retire now at 65 to take them to age 66 when the pension kicks in. But the jobseeker’s allowance lasts only nine months: after that, applicants are subject to a means test. In 2021, the situation gets worse with the gap moving from one year to two and people relying on means-tested allowances for even longer. Of course, all this depends on what a new government will do, with some parties suggesting they want to see the age return to 65.Will that fix the pension crisis?No. It can only really be solved by working longer, paying more PRSI or accepting a lower or even a means-tested State pension. It is worth noting that a pension age of 65 came in only in the 1970s – before that, the pension age in Ireland was 70.Should I join my company scheme?Absolutely. A good employer will pay between 5 and 10 per cent of your annual salary into a pension scheme. If your company has a decent scheme and you earn €40,000 per year, the company will put between €2,000 and €4,000 into your pension pot every year. You will have to match at least some of this contribution.What are the tax implications?Saving into your pension is arguably the best and most needed tax break left. It takes a good chunk of time, adequate saving and good investment choices to produce a decent-sized pot. Revenue knows this, hence the tax breaks provided. Most people still don’t realise saving into a pension is tax-efficient, which is a shame. A Standard Life survey last year found that 59 per cent of people either do not know pensions are tax-efficient or think they’re not. Tell me more.Well, pensions have a triple tax efficiency – contributions, investment growth and 25 per cent tax-free at retirement. On contributions you can receive up to 40 per cent income tax relief (after USC and PRSI are paid) if you are a higher-rate taxpayer earning €35,501 or more. Why would you pay 40 per cent of your income to the taxman if you could afford for it to go directly to your pension pot and pay for a decent retirement? Standard-rate taxpayers receive tax relief at 20 per cent – which is still a valuable tax relief for savers. This contrasts with deposits in banks, credit unions, etc, where Dirt is charged at 33 per cent. Investment growth of the fund over 30-40 years or more is tax-free and compound interest also performs its magic. For defined-contribution pension savers based on your own savings, employers’ contributions – if they contribute – and stock-market returns, at retirement age you are entitled to take 25 per cent of your fund tax-free. Back up for a second: where does the State pension actually come from?It is paid from the social insurance fund – PRSI payments go into this fund and welfare payments, including the State pension, come out of it. How is that fund doing right now?Not badly, as it happens. The fund recently returned to surplus as a surge in employment saw more PRSI payments going into the pot. But all the signs are pointing to trouble in the future as an increasing number of older people as a proportion of the population will mean the fund will struggle.What can be done?Well, the State pension can be tackled and people can be encouraged to start saving towards their retirement income needs using something called “auto-enrolment”.It would see every worker automatically enrolled in a pension scheme – obviously enough. The move would affect about 600,000 private-sector workers who are not part of a private work-based, or occupational, pension scheme.The idea is that all workers between the ages of 23 and 60 who earn more than €20,000 per year would be enrolled in the scheme unless they were already members of an occupational scheme. As a starting point they would pay 1 per cent of their gross income into the scheme, rising over time to 6 per cent. That would be matched by the employer. The State would also make a contribution – this was suggested at €1 for every €3 contributed into the scheme. In an auto-enrolment scheme a worker could choose proactively to opt out at a point within the first year of membership. The thinking is that most people, once they were in, would simply stay in. But, if not, the proposal is that they would be re-enrolled at a later point when, possibly, they would be more mature and more open to the concept of pension saving.Workers would have a choice of investment funds, albeit a fairly select one: if they didn’t make a choice, their money would go to a default fund. The pension they got on retirement would be determined by how much they contributed and how good the investment fund performance was.That sounds sensible – is it going to happen?The finer details are still being ironed out and, as with all things in Ireland, just because something is sensible does not mean it will happen, particularly if it is politicised. And make no mistake, pensions are a political hot potato. So I need a private pension: where should I start?According to Standard Life’s McEvoy there are “lots of different type of pension pots with varying returns. That said, the oldest and one of the best-owned pension funds in the marketplace over the last 30 years is the pension managed fund”. At the risk of sounding like the tracker mortgage guy on the bus, I don’t know what a managed fund is. Typically it contains a spread of equities – somewhere between 50 and 70 per cent, usually – with the remainder in lower-risk assets such as bonds, cash and property. What are the returns? They are not bad really, all things considered. Over the last 30 years the average active-managed pension fund has returned a very healthy 8.24 per cent per annum. McEvoy says her own company’s active-managed pension fund “returned a chunky 8.9 per cent per annum over almost 36 years”.What does that mean in cash terms? If you had saved €250 per month over this 36-year period, your total savings would have been €107,750 and your total pot would have been €627,665 after charges, or almost six times your money back. Generally speaking, how are pension funds doing?There are good years and there are bad years. Last year was a good one – the average Irish active-managed pension fund produced bumper returns in 2019, making it the best year for investment returns in a decade. Its value increased by more than a fifth or a return of 20.6 per cent over 12 months, according to Rubicon Investment Consulting, And what about 2018? You had to ask, didn’t you? That was the worst for Irish pension fund investors in the previous 10 years, as all funds lost ground, with the average loss coming to 5.2 per cent. Rubicon has figures for the past 20 years, which show that the average annual return over the period was 4.7 per cent. That covers a period that includes the heady years of the Celtic Tiger and the subsequent markets crash and recession.What about pension charges?Charges occur at various stages: when a pension plan is set up, during the contribution phase and when a member exits from a plan. The charges can be borne by either the employer or the member. Anyone making a pension move or decision should consider the effect of charges.What about topping up my pension?Additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) are most useful for those behind in their retirement saving or uncertain about the future value of their final-salary pension scheme. If you are starting out and have no serious drains on your finances other than nightclubs and fancy shoes, put a few bob into AVCs. They will grow your pension pot quickly and give you greater control and independence from pension shocks."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4175776.1581894946!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus irish passengers trapped on cruise ship in japan set to be evacuated","story":"The coronavirus has now spread to 25 countries, and experts here regard it as highly likely it will arrive in Ireland at some point. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t US citizens wave from a bus as they leave the Diamond Princess cruise ship  in Yokohama on Sunday night.

Video: Irish Coast GuardA pollution control team has been deployed to east Cork after a ghost ship washed up onto rocks after drifting across the Atlantic over the last year.Locals in Ballycotton alerted the Irish Coast Guard Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Valentia at about 1.15pm when they spotted the freighter driven high on to rocks at Ballyandreane during Storm Dennis.According to the Coast Guard, the vessel is the MV Alta, a 77-metre freighter that has been derelict since the US coast guard rescued the 10-man crew from the vessel in October 2018.The ship had been en route from Greece to Haiti but became disabled and had been drifting for almost 20 days when the crew radioed for help after their food and water supplies began to run low.The crew was taken off the vessel about 2,220km southeast of Bermuda in October 2018 but since then the ship has continued to drift being driven eastwards by the prevailing winds.The Royal Navy ice patrol ship, HMS Protector came across the abandoned vessel off Africa on August 30th 2019 as it sailed towards the Bahamas to assist with hurricane relief efforts.The Royal Navy attempted to make contact with the ship but received no response and it now appears it continued to drift before coming to lodge on the rocks at Ballycotton.According to the Coast Guard, it is continuing to monitor the vessel amid fears it may pose a pollution risk from its fuel tanks if it breaks up on the rocks due to stormy seas.It is expected that the Coast Guard will be liaising closely with Cork County Council, the Port of Cork and the Commissioners of Irish Lights in the coming days to decide what to do with the ship.It is understood the Coast Guard will also be liaising with a number of international agencies to try and establish the ownership of the vessel, which was built in 1976 as a general cargo ship.The ship has been the subject of an ownership dispute in the past, with claims it was once hi-jacked and towed to Guyana, but efforts will be made to establish where it was last registered.Some reports suggest the MV Alta was sailing under a Panamanian flag when its crew were rescued and it was abandoned in October 2018 while other reports suggest it was registered in Tanzania.Meanwhile Cork County Council has convened its Oil Spill Assessment Team as part of its Oil Spill Contingency Plan in response to the grounding of the cargo ship in Ballycotton on Sunday afternoon.The council is currently liaising with the Irish Coastguard in relation to the pollution risk and with the Receiver of Wreck in relation to ownership of the vessel, the council confirmed in a statement.Cork County Council, which has responsibility for land based oil pollution risk, is continuing to monitor this ship in relation to any possible oil spillage or risk arising from cargo.The Council said it understands that the vessel was most likely diesel fuelled which poses less risk of pollution than heavy fuel oil but said it could not confirm the exact risk level at this time.The ship will be inspected in day light on Monday and from a land vantage point in order to access further the risk of the vessel breaking up and discharging its fuel into the sea at Ballycotton. The council is asking members of the public to stay away from the wreck area due the ship’s unstable condition."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Coronavirus latest news: Britons stuck on quarantined ship as US airlifts 300 citizens to safety Storm Dennis: Hundreds of flood warnings remain after weekend of chaosPolitics Latest News: Environment Secretary says he is \u0026#39happy\u0026#39 with results of UK flood defences John Pienaar quits BBC after almost 30 years to join Rupert Murdoch\u0026#39s Times RadioLove Island to pay tribute to Caroline Flack as ITV faces calls for show to be cancelledThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayCoronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world \u0026#39His deathbed requests were mental!\u0026#39 - how This Country\u0026#39s final series pays a fitting tribute to Michael Sleggs, aka ‘Slugs’Comment: Caroline Flack loved Love Island - but it made her a target in a world of social media shaming Comment: The balance of power between judges and elected politicians needs to be reassessedGeneral Motors winding down historic Holden brand as it pulls out of AsiaThree stabbings in under 90 minutes in London leave three men in life-threatening conditionStorm Dennis latest news: \u0026#39Life-threatening\u0026#39 situation as major incident declared in South WalesBritain and EU will \u0026#39rip each other apart\u0026#39 in trade talks, says French foreign ministerSupercomputer to improve weather forecasts to receive £1.2 billion funding from the GovernmentRubber pavements could soften the blow for stumbling pensionersHeathrow staff write flight details on whiteboards after IT glitchUS flies passengers home from Coronavirus cruise ship in Japan as Britons say they have been abandonedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british art critic case doubt russian works wins defamation","story":"A renowned British art authority has won a defamation battle brought against him after he wrote an article alleging the majority of works in an exhibition of Russian art were forged.James Butterwick was sued by the organisers, but a  judge ruled that the 57-year-old’s “experience” meant that he was entitled to his opinion.The exhibition, featuring 61 previously “unknown” works from dozens of Russia’s most illustrious 20th-century artists, including Alexander Rodchenko and Natalia Goncharova, ran for 12 weeks from November 2013.In an article for The Art Newspaper Mr Butterwick, a specialist dealer in Russian painting, called the exhibition a “total disgrace” and claimed that it did not include “hardly any genuine pictures”.He alleged that most of the compositions displayed at the Museum of Mantegna in Mantua, Italy were “dubious” and had no traceable provenance or exhibition history.The organisers of Russian Avant Garde from Cubo-Futurism to Suprematism then launched a defamation claim.Arturo Bosio, 71, co-owner of the show, said the criticism amounted to “a serious campaign of international denigration” toward the works and the exhibition. His lawyers called the criticism “preconceived and unfounded”.However, Judge Stefania Pepe said Mr Butterwick’s comments were based on a “proven and recognised competence and experience”, and were opinions questioning the authenticity of the art rather than a personal attack.Speaking at the Court of Milan, she said: “The comments were not aimed at Mr Bosio personally and were not offensive to his reputation.”Though “delighted” with the ruling, Mr Butterwick, who lives in Chiswick, west London, feared many other art dealers would continue to suppress their views on suspected forgeries out of fear of being sued.He told The : “Too many competent art historians or experts have been scared off by legal bullying. The organisers of the Mantua exhibition have sufficient money not to have to worry about legal letters. But for an art historian with an unblemished reputation it is the end of their life if they have to pay bills that are in the thousands of pounds.“I don’t use the word fake or forgery anymore – they are dynamite.”There are now calls for better legal protection against lawsuits resulting from criticism of suspected fakes.Russian avant garde, which reached its creative peak around the 1917 October Revolution, is known for modernist paintings that are particularly easy to replicate.The art form from the futurist cafés and cabarets of the 1900s sought to express utopian ideals of the nascent Soviet socialist state, but Stalin imposed a ban that remained until just before the fall of communism.It has since been the focus of many disputes between art collectors and gallery owners.In March 2018, a German court jailed two dealers for selling forgeries and faking the provenance of paintings by Russian artists.Mr Butterwick, who speaks throughout the world on authenticity issues, admitted that forgery in Russian art was rife but difficult to prove without proper analysis.He said: “The world of Russian art is endemic with paintings of dubious authenticity. There were pictures by Russian avant-garde artists that no one had ever heard or seen before.”A spokesman for the exhibition did not respond to request for comment.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/06/TELEMMGLPICT000223160677_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"dont have regrets","story":"I could have done things better sometimes, but regret seems like a weird sort of gloatingOne of the best things about being a sociopath is that you don’t get upset about being called a sociopath, whereas fat people hate being called fat and daft people hate being called daft. We just tend to smirk in a superior style, and if we’re feeling particularly cute we have a bit of a simper – pinky finger to lips, à la Dr Evil.I’ve been called one so often, by various vexed husbands, that I rarely think about what it means any more. But if I had to sum up what does make me different from a lot of people, it’s that there are certain emotions which many lay claim to that literally have no meaning for me. Some of them sound vaguely attractive, like sleazy Seventies scents – Scruples, Shame – but others sound like silly Victorian paintings designed to make women feel bad about not being wet. Guilt would be one – and, of course, Regret.This week, a survey of 2,000 people (carried out in partnership with KP Nuts) claimed that the average citizen of our sceptred isle spends a whopping 110 hours a year – 500 waking days over a lifetime – lost in regret for what might have been 57 per cent wish they’d chosen another career path a quarter pine for lost loves. Sadly, there were no statistics as to what proportion of people regret eating that innocent‑looking packet of KP Nuts before reading how many calories they contain, which is one of the few instances of remorse I can totally identify with.A certain amount of regret is meant to be an essential part of the well-curated modern personality when we hear songs from the pre‑woke world, such as My Way (“Regrets, I’ve had a few – but then again too few to mention”) or Je Ne Regrette Rien (“No, nothing, I don’t regret anything  It’s paid, I don’t care!”), we’re meant to flaunt our emotional intelligence by reframing them through the prism of narcissism and decrying the boasters as sociopaths like me. It’s considered far more healthy and human to mope about what might have been – just see Nick Hornby’s whole career and the website Friends Reunited.Obviously, as a hardcore optimist, I’m going to be opposed to it, but regret strikes me as an inherently dishonest emotion phoney and performative, like being “wistful” or “vibrant” – another two things I doubt people do without an audience.I’m not suggesting that everyone should become a sociopath, but I believe that you self-identifying Nice Folk could learn something from us. Yes, I’ve behaved badly – yes, many times I could have done things better. But to go around actively regretting my wicked ways would seem like a weird sort of gloating.Then there’s my suspicion that regret is a kind of laziness that lets us off the hook by saying “It’s too late to write that bookhave that bodysee that world.” I doubt if the people surveyed were on their actual deathbeds if they’d made an effort, they could still change track. But how much easier to sit there in the same old rut moaning “If only…”For others, regret is a conceit “O, I could have done so much more!” What makes you think that? Maybe what you’ve done is all you could have done most of those who thought that if they’d made a different choice they’d be happier, richer or doing their dream job are probably deluded.Regret would be irritating enough if only expressed by iniduals – who at least one can steer clear of – but it can drive political movements and blight cultures. Thus pockets of privileged Westerners – often students – demand that the West ceaselessly makes a show of collective regret over slavery while turning a blind eye to the Africans complicit in it and the Arab states that still indulge in it.Much of the inability of Remainers to move on and seek closure is down to the fact they want nothing more than mass regret from us reckless Brexiteers a full-on what-have-we-done rending of garments while bearing the European flag through the streets of our ruined cities and sobbing out the Ode to Joy.But it’s worth bearing in mind that 79 per cent of people in the peanut poll believed they’d have been far happier if they’d taken more risks. So no Brexit Regret, thank you, we’re not skittish.Coronavirus latest news: Britons stuck on quarantined ship as US airlifts 300 citizens to safety Storm Dennis: Hundreds of flood warnings remain after weekend of chaosPolitics Latest News: Environment Secretary says he is \u0026#39happy\u0026#39 with results of UK flood defences John Pienaar quits BBC after almost 30 years to join Rupert Murdoch\u0026#39s Times RadioLove Island to pay tribute to Caroline Flack as ITV faces calls for show to be cancelledThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayCoronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world \u0026#39His deathbed requests were mental!\u0026#39 - how This Country\u0026#39s final series pays a fitting tribute to Michael Sleggs, aka ‘Slugs’Comment: Caroline Flack loved Love Island - but it made her a target in a world of social media shaming Comment: The balance of power between judges and elected politicians needs to be reassessedGeneral Motors winding down historic Holden brand as it pulls out of AsiaThree stabbings in under 90 minutes in London leave three men in life-threatening conditionStorm Dennis latest news: \u0026#39Life-threatening\u0026#39 situation as major incident declared in South WalesBritain and EU will \u0026#39rip each other apart\u0026#39 in trade talks, says French foreign ministerSupercomputer to improve weather forecasts to receive £1.2 billion funding from the GovernmentRubber pavements could soften the blow for stumbling pensionersHeathrow staff write flight details on whiteboards after IT glitchUS flies passengers home from Coronavirus cruise ship in Japan as Britons say they have been abandonedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/01/TELEMMGLPICT000211598551_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqv3hxuICTza90rxjOncu1SK8fQrJGiSc0wsot5slw59Q.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"overtly political judges long overdue moment reckoning","story":"Attorney General Suella Braverman must be prepared to argue for judicial reform, or the only alternative is to subject members of the Supreme Court to US-style hearings by politicians before their appointmentThe Government has been squaring up for a fight with the judiciary since what history may come to call the Prorogation Crisis of 2019 and the replacement of Geoffrey Cox by Suella Braverman as Attorney General in last week’s reshuffle seems certain to launch hostilities.Weeks before her appointment Mrs Braverman said it was time for Parliament to get back “power ceded to the courts”, and that “repatriated powers from the EU will mean precious little if our courts continue to act as political decision-maker, pronouncing on what the law ought to be and supplanting Parliament.” Were that not enough fighting talk, she continued: “Traditionally, parliament made the law and judges applied it. But today, our courts exercise a form of political power.”One has only to study the Prorogation Crisis to understand that Mrs Braverman has a point.The Supreme Court’s decision that the prorogation of Parliament was a justiciable matter ided not just the country but the legal profession. To many, it seemed that the law had become yet another of our supposedly disinterested institutions – along with the Speakership of the House of Commons – made so over-wrought by the democratic decision for Britain to leave the European Union that it would interpret the rules of the game not just to the limit, but possibly beyond it, to try to prevent that departure.It is not fanciful to suggest that an element of public outrage at this legal interference with the elected government made a contribution to the result of the general election two months later. As such, it is inevitable that the Government should use its current strength to try to redress the balance towards the representatives of the people.It is easy to see why the Supreme Court went to the lengths it did. The last parliament sat mostly during the rule of a prime minister for whom deciding even what to have for breakfast threatened to occasion a nervous breakdown. The government over which she attempted to preside was the most ineffectual, dysfunctional and chaotic in living memory, and possibly since the 18th century.Lord Sumption, formerly of the Supreme Court, implied in his Reith Lectures last year that one reason for the courts taking more upon themselves was that the quality of government decision-making had become so poor. The Supreme Court, like Nature, seems to abhor a vacuum, and duly and incrementally stepped in.However, once the leadership changed last July, and the Government started to act decisively to move the Brexit process along, the Supreme Court seemed not much to like that either.The punishment of the government in forcing them to recall parliament seemed to assert the rights of unelected judges over elected politicians. This, in turn, excited much speculation about the political leanings of the members of the court. A trawl through their biographies provided little evidence that any of them was likely to have voted to leave the EU the pleasure one or two of them visibly took in the outcome of the court case seemed to confirm the matter.England and Wales’s independent judiciary is not only prized, but is essential to a civilised democracy. But if it is going to act in a fashion that raises doubts about its independence, then steps must be taken to stop it. The judicial reforms of the Blair years that established the Supreme Court out of the old Judicial Committee of the House of Lords should be reversed.They were engaged in largely to force Lord Irvine of Lairg off the Woolsack a preposterous reason to alter one of the cornerstone of the constitution. Similarly, the Lord Chancellor should once more be a peer, sitting in the House of Lords, and part of the judiciary. Would the old House of Lords committee, with the Lord Chancellor and a member of the elected government part of it, have taken the decision the Supreme Court took last autumn? I doubt it.If Mrs Braverman is not prepared to argue for such a reform – though it is hard to see why she should not – then the only alternative is to subject members of the Supreme Court to US-style hearings by politicians before their appointment. It would go against all precedent, but if it came about it would be something the judges had brought upon themselves.The Supreme Court itself was a lamentable departure from tradition but if it is determined to go against the interests of democracy, it may have to prepare itself for another one.Law and orderCoronavirus latest news: Britons stuck on quarantined ship as US airlifts 300 citizens to safety Politics Latest News: Environment Secretary says he is \u0026#39happy\u0026#39 with results of UK flood defences Storm Dennis: Hundreds of flood warnings remain after weekend of chaosJohn Pienaar quits BBC after almost 30 years to join Rupert Murdoch\u0026#39s Times RadioLove Island to pay tribute to Caroline Flack as ITV faces calls for show to be cancelledThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayCoronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world \u0026#39His deathbed requests were mental!\u0026#39 - how This Country\u0026#39s final series pays a fitting tribute to Michael Sleggs, aka ‘Slugs’Comment: Caroline Flack loved Love Island - but it made her a target in a world of social media shaming Comment: The balance of power between judges and elected politicians needs to be reassessedGeneral Motors winding down historic Holden brand as it pulls out of AsiaThree stabbings in under 90 minutes in London leave three men in life-threatening conditionStorm Dennis latest news: \u0026#39Life-threatening\u0026#39 situation as major incident declared in South WalesBritain and EU will \u0026#39rip each other apart\u0026#39 in trade talks, says French foreign ministerSupercomputer to improve weather forecasts to receive £1.2 billion funding from the GovernmentRubber pavements could soften the blow for stumbling pensionersHeathrow staff write flight details on whiteboards after IT glitchUS flies passengers home from Coronavirus cruise ship in Japan as Britons say they have been abandonedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"storm dennis leaves trail devastation just one week storm","story":"When Storm Ciara struck last week, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake, Britain was collectively hoping the worst storm of the winter had been and gone.But on Sunday, thousands of people were evacuated from their homes, many more had their half term holidays put on hold as their flights were cancelled and a man was swept to his death by a fast flowing river.In 1966 the people of Aberfan were devastated by the collapse of a colliery spoil tip that killed 28 adults and 116 children.On Sunday, when a small slip was reported, there were fears of another landslide as residents in the Welsh mining village were evacuated.It is just one of many reported in South Wales following heavy rainfall and flooding due to the Storm Dennis.It came as police declared major incidents in Shropshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire and South Wales, with firefighters and rescue crews evacuating communities to safety.Davin Davies, who lives a mile from Aberfan, told The  that the landslide happened halfway up the mountainside on Sunday morning.“People are watching them, the council has issued evacuation advisories, as can be expected residents are concerned there may be more or things might get worse,” he said.  Welsh Singer Lleuwen Steffan, who lives opposite the mountain slope in Aberfan, said that she believes the situation is going to get “worse, not better”. “Council services are strained to breaking point due to under-funding, and they\u0027re the first port of call in flooding emergencies. We are worried that, once again, that this is an accident waiting to happen. Five miles away residents in Merthyr Tydfil were evacuated to leisure centres.While, in Tylorstown in the Rhondda Cynon Taf another landslide was caught on camera by stunned homeowners showring water and debris plummeting down the Old Smokey mountainside near to the local leisure center.Plaid Cymru politician Leanne Wood said: Some electricity poles have been taken with it. We are hoping it doesn’t slide any more, or I am told we could have a river-blockage.The third person to die since Storm Dennis had fallen into a fast-flowing river and was swept away, as multiple waterways burst their banks on Sunday.Dyfed Powys Police said he was walking near the River Tawe in Ystradgynlais, Powys, at 10am, on Sunday when he was washed away - and later discovered 8 miles downstream in the Trebanos area of the Swansea Valley.Simon Hart, MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire tweeted that the conditions in Wales were “horrendous” and thanked emergency services.The news came as a search for a woman feared to have been swept to her death on Brighton seafront in the early hours of Sunday continued.Sussex Police said she was last seen in the water around 2.45am and despite hours of searching, there was no sign of her with rescuers fearing the worst.Two other people were confirmed to have died on Saturday, an 18-year-old man who got into difficulty in the sea off Kent and another who fell overboard from a fuel tanker near Margate Harbour.Villagers of Crickhowell in Wales were seen being airlifted to safety after the river Usk bursts its banks. Firefighters were also deployed to assist with the rescue operation.In Crickhowell, Powys, Jessica Falk Perlman, told BBC Radio 5 Live how firefighters woke them at 4am to tell them they were being evacuated because the River Usk had burst its banks. She said: We saw a helicopter just winch somebody up from somewhere.Right by our house, somebody must have been in a much more dangerous situation. We\u0027re on the top floor of the house, water up to the top of the stairs but we\u0027re alright.   Meanwhile, the village of Nantgarw saw entire streets left underwater.Paul Mason, group manager of South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said the scene his team had faced was the worst he had experienced in his 31-year career.He said: In my 31 years in the service this is the worst I\u0027ve ever seen. I\u0027ve never experienced anything like this before.Some residents stood firm, refusing to leave their homes, but in Pontypridd 600 homes were evacuated near the River Taff, with rescue workers using boats to get families to safety.    Assistant Chief Constable of South Wales Police Jennifer Gilmer, sought to reassure residents, many of whom face days away from their homes. She said: Be sensible, stay well clear of any danger such as streams and rivers, and contact us in an emergency.The Environment Agency (EA) said on Sunday that there were a record number of flood warnings and alerts in force.The EA said that there had been more than 600 flood warnings and flood alerts in place across England  – more than any other day on record.There were 240 flood warnings, meaning that flooding is expected, and 338 flood alerts, meaning that flooding is possible, in place across the country.Over 900 Environment Agency staff were on active incident duty on Sunday as along with Police, Fire and Rescue and local authorities, more than 3.5km of temporary flood barriers were put up across the country with the help of the army. The Met Office said that winds of more than 80mph were recorded across parts of the country, with the highest measuring 91mph in Aberdaron in north Wales on Saturday.A total of 156.2mm of rain fell at Crai Reservoir in Powys in the 48 hours from Friday to Sunday morning, it added. The average monthly rainfall for February in Wales is 111.1mm.When Storm Ciara struck last week, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake, Britain was collectively hoping the worst storm of the winter had been and gone.Chief Fire Officer for South Wales Fire and Rescue, Huw Jakeway, said nearly 1,000 calls emergency calls and over 400 non life risk calls were received from midnight till midday on Sunday. The RAC has said the hangover from the storm this weekend will roll into tomorrow as the clear-up gets underway.Fallen trees and floods blocking road and rail lines plus more flight and ferry cancellations are expected.Around 170 flights were cancelled across the UK affecting 25,000 passengers ,with Heathrow experiencing further chaos due to a systems failure affecting all terminals.EasyJet cancelled about 118 flights, while British Airways had to axe around 50. Gatwick reported 45 of 397 flights cancelled.UK Power Networks said power cuts were also affecting the South of England.Major roads such as the M54 and M42 were also disrupted on Sunday as the Met office, who had issued their highest level red warning, said the adverse weather conditions may continue for the next 24 hours.Meteorologist Craig Snell said: We are not out of the woods yet with wind.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 17th february 2020","story":"An aerial view of the Welsh village of Crickhowell which has been cut off as the river Usk bursts its banks at Crickhowell bridge near the Bridge End Inn in Crickhowell, WalesStorm Dennis: Hundreds of flood warnings remain after weekend of chaosCoronavirus latest news: Britons stuck on quarantined ship as US airlifts 300 citizens to safety Politics Latest News: Environment Secretary says he is \u0026#39happy\u0026#39 with results of UK flood defences John Pienaar quits BBC after almost 30 years to join Rupert Murdoch\u0026#39s Times RadioLove Island to pay tribute to Caroline Flack as ITV faces calls for show to be cancelledThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayCoronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world Comment: Caroline Flack loved Love Island - but it made her a target in a world of social media shaming \u0026#39His deathbed requests were mental!\u0026#39 - how This Country\u0026#39s final series pays a fitting tribute to Michael Sleggs, aka ‘Slugs’Comment: The balance of power between judges and elected politicians needs to be reassessedGeneral Motors winding down historic Holden brand as it pulls out of AsiaThree stabbings in under 90 minutes in London leave three men in life-threatening conditionStorm Dennis latest news: \u0026#39Life-threatening\u0026#39 situation as major incident declared in South WalesBritain and EU will \u0026#39rip each other apart\u0026#39 in trade talks, says French foreign ministerSupercomputer to improve weather forecasts to receive £1.2 billion funding from the GovernmentRubber pavements could soften the blow for stumbling pensionersHeathrow staff write flight details on whiteboards after IT glitchUS flies passengers home from Coronavirus cruise ship in Japan as Britons say they have been abandonedBees are being mapped to help develop driverless cars and drones by scientists glueing tiny antennas to their heads We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2019/07/11/TELEMMGLPICT000201862214_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=45","title":"reality tv recklessly blurs line public private","story":"Shows like ‘Love Island’ invite us to judge strangers – sometimes forgetting they are human beings, tooCaroline Flack, the former host of Love Island, has taken her own life at the age of 40. I’m sensitive about the age because it is not far off my own, and there seems so much to live for, especially when you are as beautiful and loved as Caroline was. Her boyfriend has said: “My heart is broken.”I used to review Love Island for the Catholic Herald (not its natural audience) and I compared the show to a wildlife documentary: here was nature in tooth and claw, and it obviously had some animal magic because it became a big hit. Then two of its former contestants took their own lives, triggering a debate about the dangers of reality television. Had the format taken a bad turn? Was it too intrusive, too intense?No, it had just reached its logical conclusion. Love Island is not about the commodification of sex (there is barely any in it), it’s about the commodification of everyday life, and the problem with reality television is that it has blurred to the point of erasure the necessary line between public and private. In most careers, you do the job, you go home, the job stops. In reality television, the job is being you. You go home and you are still you, so the job goes on and on. There is nowhere to hide. You are trapped in a cycle of publicity. You do well, you become famous. You make a mistake, people talk about it. You get depressed and stop going out, people talk about that too.Television and social media have taken the place of God as the all-seeing eye, except that God balances judgment with mercy, whereas humans tend just to judge. Caroline had talked bravely about her mental health in the past and was facing trial for the alleged assault of her boyfriend, a case that he insisted was completely unnecessary. Either way, it was none of our business. But what little people felt they knew about Caroline made her a target for comment, almost up to the moment that her death was announced.Time, now, for thoughts and prayers, which are welcomed and treasured, no doubt – but, as Caroline’s fans have pointed out, some of them have been sent from those who make money out of criticising others and perhaps don’t think hard enough before they do it. I know I don’t. It is something I need to work on. Suicide is a desperately private and lonely act. In the absence of information, we leap to judgment: blame the tabloids, blame the haters, blame Love Island. But from what I can make out, Caroline liked her job and was good at it because people liked her. She was everybody’s big sister.It is easy to dismiss television personalities because it looks like they are coasting on just being themselves, but actually a lot of work and talent goes into being a human being. If it were easy, the world would be a much nicer place.  The Samaritans are available 24 hours a day, at samaritans.org or on 116 123Former police officer Harry Miller outside the Royal Courts of JusticeI would love to declare the Harry Miller trial a victory for free speech but, having read the full judgment, I can see we are not there yet.Mr Miller, to recap, was publicly critical of transgenderism and accused of a “non-crime hate incident”. This earned him a visit from a copper who gave Mr Miller the impression that he might face prosecution if he continued to speak out.The High Court declared the police probe misleading and unlawful and made some scathing comparisons with Nineteen Eighty-Four, but the judge actually defended the police’s policy on the recording of non-crimes even though they are the very guidelines the Pc thought he was trying to uphold. In other words, this ruling was about procedure, not policy.The judge permitted Mr Miller to take the policy to the Supreme Court, and good luck to him because it is flawed on two counts. First, it’s incredibly subjective: the police define a hate incident as that which is “perceived by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice”.The complainant “does \u2028not have to provide evidence or justify their belief”. Second, if no crime has been committed, all the police can do is spend precious time recording \u2028them – and in this instance, the officer says he was only trying to gather \u2028 some facts, perhaps unaware that all contact with the fuzz is inherently intimidating.I am convinced the guidelines are open-ended precisely to have a chilling effect on speech. The state does not want to lock up everyone who says something controversial – that would be a logistical and legal nightmare – so it is much easier to signal to society that the police might take an interest if we cross a line that no one can possibly define. The result? We won’t say anything. Just in case. The Pc disputes Mr Miller’s account of their conversation but, if it is true, it is a revelation about police culture. According to Mr Miller, the officer tried to explain how transgenderism works, saying: “You have to understand, sometimes in the womb, a female brain gets confused and pushes out the wrong body parts, and that is what transgender is.” Mr Miller said: “You’ve got to be kidding me. Wrong body parts?... Is this really the official police line?” He said the officer replied: “Yes, I have been on a course.”Coronavirus latest news: Britons stuck on quarantined ship as US airlifts 300 citizens to safety Storm Dennis: Hundreds of flood warnings remain after weekend of chaosPolitics Latest News: Environment Secretary says he is \u0026#39happy\u0026#39 with results of UK flood defences John Pienaar quits BBC after almost 30 years to join Rupert Murdoch\u0026#39s Times RadioLove Island to pay tribute to Caroline Flack as ITV faces calls for show to be cancelledThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayCoronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world \u0026#39His deathbed requests were mental!\u0026#39 - how This Country\u0026#39s final series pays a fitting tribute to Michael Sleggs, aka ‘Slugs’Comment: The balance of power between judges and elected politicians needs to be reassessedGeneral Motors winding down historic Holden brand as it pulls out of AsiaThree stabbings in under 90 minutes in London leave three men in life-threatening conditionStorm Dennis latest news: \u0026#39Life-threatening\u0026#39 situation as major incident declared in South WalesBritain and EU will \u0026#39rip each other apart\u0026#39 in trade talks, says French foreign ministerSupercomputer to improve weather forecasts to receive £1.2 billion funding from the GovernmentRubber pavements could soften the blow for stumbling pensionersHeathrow staff write flight details on whiteboards after IT glitchUS flies passengers home from Coronavirus cruise ship in Japan as Britons say they have been abandonedBees are being mapped to help develop driverless cars and drones by scientists glueing tiny antennas to their heads We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/14/12/BP-oil-rig.jpg","title":"climate change greenwashing bp net zero 2050 advertising","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.BP’s aim of achieving net zero emissions has rightly been criticised for lacking substance, but its commitment to stop misleading adverts about its impact on the climate is a welcome start – it must be held to account on this, writes Ben ChapmanBuried a couple of thousand words beneath BP’s eye-catching announcement that it aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 was an important promise that garnered much less attention.The oil company said it would stop funding “corporate reputation advertising” which, in the context of the oil and gas industry, is more commonly known as greenwash.This means BP will end its multimillion-pound “Possibilities Everywhere” campaign, which touted the company’s questionable green credentials. That’s a fairly rapid u-turn, given that the global campaign was only launched last year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesPerhaps BP has realised the futility of spending large sums highlighting the tiny part of its business that generates renewable energy when the company remains synonymous with fossil fuels.\u0026nbspAdverts on billboards, newspapers and television in the UK, US and Europe as well as on social media and online\u0026nbsppictured\u0026nbspgreen fields and windmills alongside phrases like, “working to make energy cleaner”. The ads missed out the fact that\u0026nbsp96 per cent of BP’s capital expenditure is on oil and gas.Thanks in part to the efforts of groups like environmental lawyers ClientEarth which launched a complaint against over the campaign, the company has been held to account.Two decades – and billions of barrels of oil – since BP had the chutzpah to relaunch itself as “beyond petroleum”, people have seen through the facade.“In future, any corporate advertising will be to push for progressive climate policy communicate our net zero ambition invite ideas or build collaboration,” BP said.This statement, unlike the target to go carbon neutral by 2050, can be scrutinised immediately and it will be. I will be closely watching BP’s public statements on climate change this year, as well as its advertising and involvement with groups like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to check that they measure up.We can all play a part in this too. Earlier this month Ryanair was banned from claiming that it was Europe’s “lowest CO2 emissions airline”. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the statement couldn’t be backed up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

BP sets target to achieve net zero by 2050 to tackle climate emergencyThe climate crisis is real, but Boris Johnson still ‘doesn’t get it’Boris Johnson forces out UK president of climate change summitAnyone can make a complaint to the ASA about an issue like an misleading environmental claim, it just requires filling out a few boxes on an online form.If this action does not stop airlines and oil companies producing dodgy ads on climate change, sterner laws must be enforced. ClientEarth’s suggestion that fossil fuel adverts should be banned unless they have a tobacco-style health warning need to be\u0026nbspconsidered.A fossil fuel company portraying itself as good for the climate is no less ridiculous, or dangerous, than the tobacco companies that in the 1950s pushed cigarettes with recommendations from friendly-looking doctors.Companies that create misleading adverts about climate change need to face the prospect of fines, not just damage to their\u0026nbspreputation. Currently the ASA, is self-funded by advertisers themselves and can only ban particular promotions, often months after they’ve\u0026nbspgone out.While advertising is an important way that large greenhouse gas emitters can use their financial clout to shift the debate in their favour, a more significant front on the climate change\u0026nbspinformation war\u0026nbspis political lobbying.Here too, BP has laid down a marker by which it can be judged not in 10 years or 20 years, but almost immediately.\u0026nbspThe company laid out a less aggressive approach to lobbying, stating that it would “set new expectations” for its relationships with oil industry trade associations. Where those influential groups are pushing for policies that don’t align with BP’s new approach, it will leave.Created with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Basically, this is an admission that BP’s net-zero ambition simply has no credibility if the company remains a member of powerful lobby groups like the American Petroleum Institute which has for decades funded climate change denial in a successful effort to cast doubt on the scientific consensus. BP either has to fundamentally change the API or leave it.The impact of a big oil industry player changing tack could be considerable but action needs to follow words. I’ll also be scrutinising other large oil industry firms about whether they will follow BP in “advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing”.Fossil fuel lobbyists have vast budgets that allow\u0026nbspthem\u0026nbspto shift public policy and discussion significantly towards the industry’s own interests over and above those of everyone else.In any case, oil companies\u0026nbsplike formerly state-owned BP have frequently been pushing on open doors in the corridors of power. Seen by\u0026nbsppoliticians\u0026nbspto be of strategic national importance, oil majors have provided\u0026nbspthe vital commodity that fuels economic growth and\u0026nbspdelivers votes.It’s fair to say the oil majors have frequently enjoyed a cosy relationship with governments sympathetic to their aims.\u0026nbspVast budgets to fund misinformation and dodgy science have been key to prolonging the life of fossil fuel industry decades after oil companies knew climate change was dangerous and man-made.\u0026nbspClimate campaigners, who have enjoyed less privileged access to political decision-makers, have therefore been fighting a hugely asymmetric battle but one which they may now finally be starting to win.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But it is a way you can achieve positive changeInvesting in trackers means you have to take the rough with the smooth, hitching your wagon to oil companies and natural resource outfits if they\u0027re in the index you\u0027re tracking. The\u0026nbspFTSE\u0026nbsp100 has a lot of those\u0026nbspInvestment funds that aim to follow or “track” the performance of a designated stock market index, as opposed to trying to beat it, are inexpensive, easy to understand and hugely popular, especially amongst novice investors.\u0026nbspWith good reason. Most of the time they outperform so called actively managed funds run by stock pickers which too rarely beat the markets they\u0027re benchmarked against after their higher costs are factored in.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut trackers pose a problem for people who are concerned enough about the climate crisis to want to green up their investments.\u0026nbspA tracker investor\u0026nbspis inevitably exposed to most, or all, of the constituents of the index their chosen fund tracks. So they have to take the rough with the smooth. Sometimes the rough is very rough indeed from the perspective of planet earth.Britain’s premier stock market index is, for example, chock full of natural resource companies. They are some of FTSE 100\u0027s biggest and most important constituents.\u0026nbspEthical investment isn’t always ethical – here’s what to considerCan cutting investment force firms to go green?World’s largest fund manager to sell coal investments You have oil giants (BP, Shell), you have mining companies (Anglo American, BHP Group, Rio Tinto).\u0026nbspA person who saves via a FTSE 100 or FTSE All Share tracker is hitching their wagon to the performance of all of these companies. So if, say, BP does well, they do well.\u0026nbspTalk about carrying the mark of Cain.\u0026nbspDoes this mean their only option is to scour the ranks of actively managed funds with ESG (environmental, social and governance) screening? Do they have to leave the cheapest, and best, route into the market for most novice and smaller investors on the shelf?\u0026nbspOne way of solving this apparent dilemma is through choosing a tracker manager prepared to vote in favour of things like climate resolutions when they’re put forward.\u0026nbspRegular readers of this column will recall that I looked at the voting behaviour of big asset managers in the last edition. I highlighted two separate studies that found European money managers do a lot better than their US peers when it comes to voting in favour of progressive resolutions.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Currently, it is no more than a large, open sewer that is choking with industrial and domestic discharge that includes plastic, flowers and debris and has virtually no aquatic life.Plastic waste is washed up on South Troon beach in Scotland. Recent reports by scientists have confirmed, plastics dumped in the world oceans are reaching a dangerous level with micro plastic particles now being found inside filter feeding animals and amongst sand grains on our beaches.  Children collect plastic to be sold and recycled, in a polluted river in suburban Manila. The city\u0027s trash disposal agency traps solid waste floating down waterways that was thrown into the water by residents of slums along riverbanks upstream. View of the Carpayo Beach in La Punta, Callao, some 15 km of Lima. In 2013, the NGO VIDA labeled the Carpayo Beach as the most polluted in the country - 40 tons of trash on each 500m2.Trash from Kamilo Beach in Hawaii.   A scavenger collects plastic cups for recycling in a river covered with rubbish near Pluit dam in Jakarta.Rubbish fills Omoa beach in Honduras. Floating masses of garbage offshore from some of the Caribbean\u0027s pristine beaches are testimony to a vast and growing problem of plastic pollution heedlessly dumped in our oceans,  locals, activists and experts say.A man climbs down to a garbage filled river in Manila. Plastic rubbish will outweigh fish in the oceans by 2050 unless the world takes drastic action to recycle the material, a report warned in 2016.Garbage on East Beach, Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands), in the south Pacific Ocean. The uninhabited island has been found to have the world\u0027s highest density of waste plastic, with more than 3,500 additional pieces of litter washing ashore daily at just one of its beaches. This is also why I am keeping a close eye on the experience of all my fellow pledgers. How can I avoid using plastic further? Can I plan my next holiday by train travel? What local produce can I opt for instead of fruit flown in from thousands of miles away? Can I start growing my own parsley and spring onion (my parents have an annual supply of potatoes from their allotment, maybe I have learnt a thing or two from them)?Modern day consumerism (i.e. capitalism) fuels our desire to have more and more. We are somehow convinced we need all this stuff. The planet is at the desperate point where we need to convince ourselves that we actually do not.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They could be anything from sniffing hints of chemicals on alien worlds to indications that there could be structures or lasers on other planets.Dr Tony Beasley, director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) telescope based in Virginia, US, said: Determining whether we are alone in the universe as technologically capable life is among the most compelling questions in science.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Scientists hope that citizen scientists will be able to find interesting things in the data – whether that is unknown natural phenomena, or something even more unexpected, such as alien life.“Since Breakthrough Listen’s initial data release last year, we have doubled what is available to the public,” said Breakthrough Listen’s lead system administrator, Matt Lebofsky. “It is our hope that these data sets will reveal something new and interesting, be it other intelligent life in the universe or an as-yet-undiscovered natural astronomical phenomenon.”Yuri Milner, an entrepreneur and founder of the Breakthrough initiative, said: For the whole of human history, we had a limited amount of data to search for life beyond Earth.So, all we could do was speculate.Now, as we are getting a lot of data, we can do real science and, with making this data available to general public, so can anyone who wants to know the answer to this deep question.The initiatives and strategies in expanding the search for extraterrestrial life were presented at the the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Seattle.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is particularly true in the south, where rents are rising the most.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS.

Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on.

I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia earlier today, but I was determined to give you the best show humanly possible.“I played and sang my heart out, until my voice could sing no more. I’m disappointed, deeply upset and sorry. I gave it all I had. Thank-you so much for your extraordinary support and all the love you showed me during tonight’s performance. I am eternally grateful. Love, Elton xx.”Sir Elton’s Auckland show was part of his 300-date Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, the last before he retires.In the recent documentary, Elton John: Uncensored, the singer revealed he was “24 hours from snuffing it” when he contracted a serious infection after having surgery for prostate cancer, and said he was so sick he “had to learn how to walk again”.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s also entirely ultrared, or highly reflective, which is commonplace in the faraway Twilight Zone of our solar system known as the the Kuiper Belt.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The reddish color is indicative of organic molecules.While frozen methane is present, no water has yet been found on the body, which is an estimated 22 miles (36 kilometers) long tip to tip. At a news conference Thursday in Seattle, New Horizons\u0027 chief scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said its size was roughly that of the city.As for the snowman shape, it\u0027s not nearly as flat on the backside as previously thought. Neither the small nor big sphere is fully round, but far from the flatter pancake shape scientists reported a year ago. The research team likened the somewhat flattened spherical forms to the shape of M\u0026ampMs.No rings or satellites have been found. The light cratering suggests Arrokoth dates back to the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. It likely was created by a slow, gentle merger between two separate objects that possibly were an orbiting pair. The resulting fused body is considered a contact binary.This kind of slow-motion hookup likely arose from collapsing clouds in the solar nebula, as opposed to intense collisions theorized to form these planetesimals, or little orbiting bodies.New Horizons flew past Arrokoth on Jan. 1, 2019, more than three years after the spacecraft visited Pluto. Originally nicknamed Ultima Thule, the object received its official name in November Arrokoth means sky in the language of the Native American Powhatan people.Launched in 2006, the spacecraft is now 316 million miles (509 million kilometers) beyond Arrokoth. The research team is looking for other potential targets to investigate. Powerful ground telescopes still under construction will help survey this part of the sky.Emerging technology will enable scientists to develop a mission that could put a spacecraft in orbit around Pluto, 3 billion miles (5 billion kilometers) away, according to Stern. After a few years, that same spacecraft could be sent even deeper into the Kuiper Belt to check out other dwarf planets and objects, he said.The New Horizons scientists reported their latest findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as in three separate papers in the journal Science.David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the studies, said a flyby mission like New Horizons, where encounters last just a few days, is hardly ideal.For future missions, we need to be able to send spacecraft to the Kuiper Belt and keep them there in orbit around objects, Jewitt wrote in a companion piece in Science. That would allow these intriguing bodies to be studied in stunning geological and geophysical detail, he noted.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS. It was designed for a global group of brands, which we no longer are.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Free health care? A jobs guarantee? Isn’t that socialism?Cardi B and Mark Ruffalo among celebrities backing Bernie SandersWhy the rise of Bernie Sanders is making some Democrats nervousWill bitter moderates vote for Bernie Sanders?But while policies such as free universal healthcare are seen as extreme in the US they are perfectly ordinary in Europe.The higher tax and spending proposed by Sanders would also not be out of place on the other side of the Atlantic.The economist Paul Krugman says Sanders is better described as a European-style social democrat rather than a socialist, not least because Sanders isn’t proposing to nationalise private industries.OK, but would this ruin the American economy?The French economist Thomas Piketty even argues Sanders’\u0026nbsppolicies could be beneficial to the US economy\u0026nbspby raising the country’s growth rate, and says that his wealth distribution policies tap into an older tradition of American policymaking.“Remember that the US is actually the country that invented progressive taxation of income and wealth in the 20th century,” Piketty points out.Others have described Sanders as a “New Dealer”, referring to the progressive economic policies put in place by former\u0026nbspDemocratic President Franklin Roosevelt in the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s.So why are people describing Sanders as dangerous?But it may also be that the genuinely fear Sanders’ policies, even if they are in the mainstream of the European tradition, will do damage in the US context.Or they may be assuming that Sanders, if he won power, would pursue policies that go much further than those he has proposed, with the 78-year-old proving more radical in office, perhaps like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.Against this, though, is the institutional fact that US presidents are constrained by Congress in what policies they can enact. Sanders might be in favour of relatively radical redistribution, but that’s not true of the wider Democratic party.Even some of Sanders’ rivals for the Democratic nomination, such as Pete Buttigieg, are critical of his policies such as the $15 federal minimum wage.That’s why many analysts – even those who support the principle of “medicare-for-all” – think there is little chance he could actually deliver it, even if he won power.And while some financiers are sounding the alarm, others are more sanguine.Another Wall Street Bank, JPMorgan, recently told its clients that, even if Sanders were elected, “we put the probability of major changes like medicare-for-all or a wealth tax at less than 5 percent.”All of which raises a question: is the risk less that Sanders ruins the US economy than that he disappoints his supporters?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But do not lose sight of the balance sheet.Gordon Brown did — and Britain is still counting the cost.ELLIE Gould fought back hard against her ex-boyfriend’s frenzied kne attack.It wasn’t enough.

Billions, for sure.What’s interesting is that the ship did not go down with all hands lost.There were  survivors — and they were able to tell rescuers where the Nuestra Senora had sunk. That information has not been lost.So why are we just sitting back letting Spain and Mexico get on with it Britain needs money for its exciting new railway line and all the hospitals Boris Johnson has promised.Andthere’s a small mountain of it sitting at the bottom of the sea off Mexico’s east coast, why don’t we just sneak over there and help ourselves Certainly, our new six-year-old Chancellor should be considering this . . .  once he’s finished his morning bowl of Frosties and tidied his room.Think about it. We have naval ships in the region waging a hopeless war against South American drug cartels. So why not simply ask them to drive around with their sonar on I feel sure thatthis equipment can find a near-silent Russian submarine gently humming its way through the depths, it would have no trouble at all spotting  tons of gold and silver.Or we could draft in RRS Boaty McBoatface . That’s designed to map the seabed and would be a very useful tool.Frankly, having it in the Caribbean looking for treasure is a much better use of it than having it wandering around Antarctica studying penguins and looking for more dreary evidence of climate change. We know already.I bet the crew would be happier too.Of course, when we do find the loot, Spain will claim it’s theirs, in the same way they say they own Gibraltar.No worries. We’ll just behave like we do when the Greeks say they want the Elgin Marbles back.And Mexico  It’s true the jewels and the gold were sourced from their neck of the woods.But as every schoolboy knows, it’s “finders, keepers”.Britain has a reputation for fair play and decency, but in a cut-and-thrust world we need to be a bit more devious.Maybe then we could find the loot and tell the world we hadn’t. “Nope. Nothing there. Sorry.”IF I were to list all the Bond music in order of greatness – and being a man, EVERYTHING has to be listed like this – Octopussy’s All Time High by Rita Coolidge would be the all-time high.I love Rita Coolidge. She sounds like she’s singing while sitting down.At No, from On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, I’d have We Have All The Time In The World, by Louis ­Armstrong, who sounds like he’s lying down in the bath. And at No it’d be the ­incidental music used during the ski chase in the same movie.I’d have to go a long way down the list – past Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang from ­Thunderball, past the music used in the cinema adverts before the film started, and down past the Muzak playing when I took my seat – before I got to the dreary song chosen for the ­latest  outing.Performed by Billie Eilish, it is about as memorable as the middle of a Tuesday night.LIKE lots of box-set enthusiasts, I was captivated by Netflix’s drama The Stranger.“Let’s do one more”, I’d say every night. “Come on. It’s only am.”Set in northern England and starring Richard Armitage, the plot twisted and turned, building to the point that in the final episode I started to wonder how all the endless storylines could all be brought together and tied off.I was intrigued. Fascinated. On the edge of my seat.And then – with a load of stuff still up in the air – it just ended.What I had sat through, then, was a beautully told eight-hour joke. With no punchline.THE BBC has signed up Greta Thunberg to present a new series about monster truck racing in Texas.Only kidding. She’s been signed to present a show on – you’ll never guess – climate change.“I can’t wait. It’ll be so exciting,” said no one.I’VE always said hybrid cars are too heavy, thanks to the fact they have two engines.And now this ­photo of a Toyota Prius proves it.NORMALLY, I’m in full agreement with The Sun’s television critic, Ally Ross.But his review of ­Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Lab show on Netflix was wide of the mark.He described it as “dumb and dangerous”.Wrong, mate. It was way worse than that.At one point, they had two women playing with a vibrator the size of a JCB.And somehow they managed to make the scene even more boring than The One Show.WHENEVER somebody builds a really good bridge, I’ll travel miles out of my way to go and look at it. I realise this is a bit tragic.My favourite bridge in the whole wide world spans the Humber.It’s so graceful and delicate – and when I stand at one end and watch it disappear into the mist on a summer’s morning, I often suffer from a small but embarrassing trouser moment.The only annoying thing about the Humber Bridge is that they went to all the trouble and expense of building it simply to connect the small village of Hessle to the even smaller village of Barton. Two places no one has ever heard of.The fabulous Oresund Bridge was needed because it links Sweden and Denmark.It’s the same story in San Francisco, which has many great bridges that connect the city to the rest of Calornia.That’s the point of a bridge. It links two places that need to be linked.Which brings me on to Boris Johnson’s plan to build a -mile bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.Hmmm. I’m aware the Chinese have built a sea bridge this long, but this is a nation that built a whole new coronavirus hospital in SIX DAYS.We are just not that fast. We can’t even build a new railway line without a -year argument.And the fact is that when we finish our new bridge, midway through the rd Century, we will have linked a place called Larne to a place called Portpatrick.Now, I don’t want to have a downer on the plan.Butwe are going to build a -mile bridge over the sea, wouldn’t it be more usefulit went from Dover to Calais Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More like an actress acting the part of someone who cares. As so many of them do.“I find Portman’s type of activism deeply offensive to those of us who actually do the work. I’m not writing this out of bitterness, I am writing out of disgust,” she wrote.Unfortunately, coming from someone who has been so integral in the protest movement, this sounds like sour grapes.Natalie’s response to Rose’s criticism was as elegant and as understated as her protest.She said: “I agree with Ms McGowan that it is inaccurate to call me ‘brave’ for wearing a garment with women’s names on it.“Brave is a term I more strongly associate with actions like those of the women who have been testying against Harvey Weinstein the last few weeks.”She also responded to Rose’s accusation that Natalie has only been directed twice by women.But in this criticism, Rose is seriously missing the point. Female directors don’t get as far in Hollywood as male ones, which is precisely what Natalie is pointing out with her cloak protest. Therefore, there are fewer available to work with.As Natalie said: “It is true I’ve only made a few films with women. In my long career, I’ve only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times . . . Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.“Female films have been incredibly hard to get made at studios, or to get independently financed. If these films do get made, women face enormous challenges during the making of them.”By the way, this is not the first time Natalie has protested from within the system.While presenting the best director category at the Golden Globes in , she introduced the line-up by saying: “And here are the all-male nominees.”Again, it’s not a shouty, noisy street protest. But it served to make her point. Just that she did it in a dferent way than Rose might. And that’s fine.In fact, some people think that Rose’s in-your-face type of protest risks alienating some people.I think women should support each other when it comes to vying for equality.But also, Rose just sounded spiteful when she said Natalie was “an actress acting like someone who cares”.Rose is a hero to many women. But she needs to understand that whether their contribution is big or small, loud or subtle, anyone’s effort to affect change helps.JANE Fonda, who looked fabulous at the Oscars, has said she is done with plastic surgery.Well, I guess  is as good an age as any to stop nipping and tucking.She must have a great doctor, as whatever the actress has had done has been done very well indeed – because, in my experience, it’s not often you look better after a facelt than you did before.PERHAPS Andrea Leadsom had a premonition that she was going to be axed as Business Secretary in this week’s Cabinet reshuffle.She recently wrote a column obliquely warning Boris Johnson not to cut the number of female ministers in his Cabinet.Addressing the issue of female board members among FTSE  companies, Andrea wrote: “Working in the City in the Nineties, I saw myself how a male-dominated environment can limit a career.”Unfortunately for her, the warning did not save her skin and she has been sacked, along with Theresa Villiers as Environment Secretary and housing minister Esther McVey.By the way, eight of the  members of Mr Johnson’s first Cabinet were female –  per cent.Despite these sackings, that figure has actually risen – slightly – to nearly  per cent.Ideally, the split would be an even -.But the reality is that business and politics can both be brutal.Men and women alike must accept they might one day get the sack.It simply goes with the territory.Being selected on the basis of gender is just as wrong as being sacked on that basis.Right person, right job, regardless of their gender.THAT is what true equality means.SAY what you like about the bonkers lestyle advice dispensed by Gwyneth Paltrow on Goop – and some of it is seriously out there.But whatever she is doing clearly works.She is, at the age of , nothing short of radiant.In fact she looks amazing and also happy.Not only that but she became instantly relatable to parents everywhere with a confession that her -year- old daughter finds her embarrassing.That’s a good reminder there is nothing like a teenager to keep you normal and down to earth for fear that you will embarrass them, no matter what you do.Although, to be fair, perhaps Gwyneth’s daughter has had a predisposition to feel embarrassed by her mother ever since she named her  . . . Apple.What are the ethics of seat-reclining on a long-haul flight An American Airlines passenger raised the question after video-shaming a fellow traveller who punched and pushed her seat when she reclined it.Bearing in mind the recline button moves the seat about in, I suspect this chap has anger issues, as reclining a seat that has a recline button is hardly an act of aggression.I’d disable the recline button and then all you have to fight over is the armrest.DAMIAN Hurleys resemblance to his mother, Liz, is uncanny.More so than ever in the latest shots of the two of them together, which he posted online this week.Some people think it is vaguely unsettling that he looks more like Liz Hurley than Liz Hurley.But as a mum myself, I think it’s heartwarming a teenage boy should be so happy to emulate his mother.OH the utter folly of the face tattoo!The latest to succumb to this trend, which a few years ago would be, frankly, unthinkable, is Amber Rose.She has had the words Bash and Slash tattooed across her forehead in old English manuscript style.It’s a reference, apparently, to the model’s three-month-old son Slash, and six-year-old son Sebastian. And, obviously, it’s lovely that she loves her children so much.But tattooing their names on her forehead where they will remain for all her le  All I can say is: Tattoo in haste . . . repent at leisure.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Don’t tell Greta Thunberg!And without his royal blood, Prince Harry would not be in talks with Goldman Sachs about a future relationship.If they were not British royalty, Meghan would be a B-list actress whom few people had ever heard of and Harry an old soldier with two rotten A-levelsfrom Eton — a school where my dog Stan could get four good grades and an offer from Oxbridge.I do not doubt Harry and Meghan’s sincerity when they say they want to be financially independent.But because they are poncing on royal connections, the couple have a duty of care to the Queen and to this country.Please don’t embarrass the Royal Family, or British people who shelled out £million for your wedding.Please do not turn into the preening glove puppets of investment bankers.Oh Harry, please don’t turn into Tony Blair in a tiara.Oh Meghan, don’t become the st-century Fergie.Prince Andrew’s reckless friendship with convicted billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein has humiliated and damaged the Royal Family.Andrew’s total lack of judgment may have done irreparable harm to the monarchy.Many of us wonderthe institution will last after the Queen has gone.So show some dignity, Harry and Meghan. Engage your brains, not your bank balance.Have a little DISCRETION. Please do not pimp your royal connections to any passing dodgy billionaire or investment banker who claims to care deeply about your charity work.Frankly, it doesn’t look good so far.The nation cringed when Prince Harry buttonholed Disney boss Bob Iger at the London premiere of The Lion King, aggressively pitching Meghan’s availability for “voiceover” work.A member of the Royal Family begging a Hollywood big-shot for work was not a pretty sight.When they handed in their letter of resignation, Harry and Meghan made lofty announcements about “collaborating” with the Queen, as though Her Majesty, , is some grime DJ who could be brought in to remix their latest single.The brutal truth is that we will not see much of Harry and Meghan in these parts.This week they sacked  loyal UK staff and shut their Buckingham Palace office.But by turning their backs on the royal le, Harry and Meghan have placed themselves in an almost impossible situation.They claim to want to be financially independent of Prince Charles and the British taxpayer.Then they will have to grab the big pay days where they can.They will have to earn phenomenal sums of money to fund the lavish lestyle to which they are accustomed.But there is absolutely nothing in either of their CVs to suggest they can make that kind of dough without flogging their royal connections to the highest bidder.If Harry and Meghan are going to support themselves, they are going to have to get their hands dirty in the working world.Harry’s discussions with Goldman Sachs may be focused on his charity work right now, but investment bankers are not renowned for their boundless human compassion.Big bankers — and mega-rich companies like Netflix and Apple — will look at Harry and Meghan and wonder what they can get out of them.Harry and Meghan are free to demean themselves, as Harry did so spectacularly when he shook his diamond-encrusted begging bowl at the boss of Disney.But please don’t demean this country.Please don’t debase the Royal Family, as Prince Andrew has done.Please, Harry and Meghan — do not embarrass the Queen.Because let’s face it, chaps — without your royal connections, the pair of you really don’t add up to very much at all.After all those wild decades, Keith – who is said to have smoked an estimated , fags in his time – clearly believes in moderation in all things.Especially moderation in moderation.IN a pithy turn of phrase worthy of Oscar Wilde, one commentator mused that Labour’s dishevelled Tracy Brabin looked like she had been “banged over a wheelie bin” in her off-the-shoulder frock in the House of Commons.Showing Tracy how it is done, Kate Beckinsale looked stunning in a very similar off-the-shoulder number at a pre-Oscars party.Kate also looks as though she has never even seen a wheelie bin.But it’s not true. I recall Debbie Harry was a dazzling double NME winner in  – Pin-Up Of The Year and Best Female Singer.The NME may be  years old. But NME award winners never get any older.THE coronavirus could well be China’s Chernobyl – the national calamity that changes everything.As the global death toll of the virus nears ,, the old men in Beijing who run China have never looked so woefully out of their depth.The greatest hero in China today is Dr Li Wenliang, the -year-old Wuhan doctor who tried to warn the Communist regime of the virus.Dr Li was arrested, bullied, humiliated, accused of scaremongering and later died of the virus.That is what happens in a one-party state that considers all criticism to be treason.China does not look like the next economic superpower today.China looks like an inept one-party state that failed to grasp the seriousness of the virus, then stubbornly refused to heed the warnings that could have contained it, and has now exported it to the rest of the world.The coronavirus came out of the so-called wet markets of China, where every conceivable animal is kept in filthy conditions to cater for the Chinese appetite for “exotic” animals.Wolf pups, koala bears and assorted rats, bats and snakes are all on offer for the discerning wildle gourmet, many under the counter.These markets were the breeding ground for Sars nearly  years ago, and they were the breeding ground for the coronavirus.Exactly how stupid can a regime be that allows the existence of these unregulated markets  The virus that is now polluting the entire planet was totally avoidable.Mikhail Gorbachev was convinced that the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in  caused the collapse of the Soviet Union five years later.The Chernobyl explosion “opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression”, said Gorbachev. “To the point that the system as we knew it could no longer continue.”If the coronavirus brings down China’s ruling Communist elite, it will be exactly what they deserve.Now Leo has seen his Fine Gael party poll a wretched . per cent of the vote in the Irish general election, going from power to third place overnight.Looks like Leo Varadkar is a teeny-weeny politician now.Now BBC chairman David Clementi squeaks that ending the licence fee will mean scrapping children’s channel CBeebies.Stop our money and you will make all the kiddies cry!But the openly biased BBC stopped being a state broadcaster years ago.It no longer deserves to be funded like one.TANYA McDonnell is a modern success story.Tanya was working in McDonald’s in Washington, Tyne-and-Wear, for £ an hour until a modelling agency spotted her holiday shots on Instagram.“I’d always looked up to people like Kate Moss,” says Tanya. “But I didn’t think I had a chance because I wasn’t pretty enough.”Only in the age of social media could a girl go from having her picture taken on holiday to making a living as a model.And only in the age of social media could someone who looks like Tanya McDonnell fret that she is not pretty enough.I didn’t know he had one.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Soon we were Skyping daily. I’d just come out of a terrible orce so it felt exciting.“I’m heartbroken and penniless.”Claire then ed to the UK and the couple decided to marry but her bids to get him into Britain were constantly knocked back by immigration officials.The former teaching assistant then took drastic measure to be with her lover and decided to ditch her British citizenship for an Irish passport.This allowed to get a spousal visa as she was classed as an EU worker living in the UK.She moved him into her home in the West Midlands in  despite repeated warnings from her daughters and opened a joint-account in the Dominican to fund the construction of a new flat on top of his dads home.Shattered Claire - now living in a shack on the island - said: “I was advised UK law would override EU law so I decided to give up my British citizenship so I was solely Irish – or an EU citizen living in the UK.He was granted a UK visa as spouse of an EU worker.

I was the only black man working at the company.But at least justice has now been done and it was ruled that what happened to me was wrong.”The Manchester Tribunal Hearing Centre heard how boss Steven Savery violated Alwayne’s dignity in front of other workers.He denied fondling Mr Thompson or making racist remarks.Mr Savery said he “always” repeated the same comment about “blokes with big feet, big shoes” when the lads’ protective boots arrived.But Judge Rhodri McDonald condemned the jibe as an “ill-judged attempt at humour”.He said: “We found that Mr Savery did on more than one occasion make the remark about black men and did grab his private parts.“That conduct was unwanted conduct and had the effect of humiliating the claimant.”Alwayne was fired for gross misconduct in August  after being involved in an alleged racial punch-up with a Polish co-worker.He told the tribunal that when he raised allegations of racism, company boss Jonathan Wheeldon told him: “You don’t come here to make friends”.Workers also made racist remarks against Alwayne after the  Manchester bombing, with one saying: “We don’t want black people in our country”.The tribunal urged the company to improve equality and ersity training. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her baby died weeks later, shortly after his birth.Then Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped her of her British citizenship, a decision Ms Begums lawyers argued was unlawful as it left her stateless.Shamimas latest interview comes after a top anti-terror lawyer warned Jihadi brides should be treated as harshly as terrorist husbands.Jonathan Hall QC said: Calling all women Jihadi brides by portraying them as passive victims of males in some cases risks underplaying female agency the law does not quite deal with those who provide important moral but not material support.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ellen.The yellow warning issued by the Met Office which had been place across Essex came to an end at midnight.The only weather warnings in place today are in Scotland, although the weather is set to calm down as the day goes on.So far weve had Atiyah, Brendan, Ciara, Storm Dennis and, as previously mentioned, next up is Ellen.Analysis has shown that naming storms makes people more aware of the severe weather and helps them prepare for them in advance.The Met Office and its Irish counterpart Met Eireann decided to follow the US system of giving girls and boys names to tropical storms and hurricanes.Surveys showed people were more aware of the threat and more likely to take action after hearing the name of a storm, rather than a forecast simply saying bad weather is on the way.For example,  per cent of people said they were aware of the approaching Storm Doris – which wreaked havoc in February  – and  per cent said warnings were useful.A total of  names were chosen by Met Office and Met Eireann – whittled down from a total of more than , suggestions submitted by the public.One name was picked for each letter of the alphabet, apart from Q, U, X, Y and Z.Every major storm will be named according to the list, ordered alphabetically.To ensure the Met Office is in line with the US National Hurricane Centre naming conventions, it does not include names which begin with the letters Q, U, X, Y and Z.This is to ensure consistency for official storm naming in the North Atlantic - to reduce confusion for fellow weather experts, sea captains and pilots.In America, when all the names in the storm alphabet are used, names are given following the Greek alphabet .A study of American hurricanes has shed light on an alarming pattern, and explained that more people are killed by female storms than those with male names.The reason why is all down to how we subconsciously view gender, since were more likely to assume that storms with female names will be less dangerous.Incredibly, the  study added that the more feminine the name, the more people a storm is likely to kill.The researchers even suggested that changing a hurricanes name from Charley to Eloise could triple the number of fatalities.Co-author Sharon Shavitt, a professor at the University of Illinois, said: In judging the intensity of a storm, people appear to be applying their beliefs about how men and women behave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Pregnant at , I was out of school and about to be a parent. I felt embarrassed asking friends and family for help, worrying I wouldn’t be a good mother. Then I took a parenting course at one of Labour’s new children’s centres. I learned how to cuddle my son, read to him, make sure he had the right food. That might seem simple, but it wasn’t obvious to me. It meant my son had a better start in le than I’d had. It helped to break the cycle, and it helped turn my le around too. Taking that course showed me not just how to look after my son, but that I could learn, and there was more out there. That investment in me has been paid back many times over. The evidence shows that’s true for many others too. It’s why it’s heart-breaking to see what’s happened to Sure Start under the Tories. For years they’ve twisted and squirmed, denying the impact of their cuts. Now, we’ve finally got the truth out of them. Since they took power, over a third of Sure Start centres, more than , have been lost.

Jean-Yves le Drian made the gloomy prediction as Brussels and London face a race against time to nail down a trade deal before a December  deadline. Boris Johnson wants a Free Trade Agreement like the one the EU struck with Canada - but that took seven years. And the PM has refused to extend a apostransition periodapos to , which would give more time.Franceaposs Foreign Minister made clear that Brussels will defend its interests when negotiations begin in earnest next month. He told the annual Munich Security Conference: I think that on trade issues and the mechanism for future relations, which we are going to start on, we are going to rip each other apart. But that is part of negotiations, everyone will defend their own interests. Mr le Drian is a close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, who repeatedly used hardball tactics when the UK was trying to negotiate an exit deal from the EU. But he is only the latest senior EU figure to warn negotiations will be dficult. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and chief negotiator Michel Barnier have both cast doubt on Boris Johnsonaposs aim to reach a full deal by December . And the EU has warned Britain cannot expect high quality market accessit insists on its own rules on workers and the environment. There is expected to be a particularly tough fight over fishing rights, with the EU insisting continued access to UK waters must form part of any agreement.  Mr Johnson, in turn, has said the UK will act as an independent coastal state taking control of its own fisheries. But Downing Street has admitted any deal will not be frictionless - which will mean new tarfs on goods from  January , evena trade deal is struck. If it isnapost, the penalty could be much higher - with billions of pounds of trade reverting back to high default World Trade Organisation tarfs when it crosses the border. Cabinet minister George Eustice today said the French minister had used colourful language but he insisted there could be a sensible agreement. Sky News, however, reported tensions are already rising - with a UK government source claiming Brusselsapos demands ahead of the talks are unreasonable and ridiculous.

The people’s Old Etonian will regret assuming supreme power when it all goes wrong and the blame for cock-ups and conspiracies leads directly to No because that’s the only path. SoTransport Secretary Grant Shapps is right about the March  Budget being delayed, then it is First Lord of the Treasury Johnson’s fault as he turned  Downing Street into A. Puppet Chancellor Rishi Sunak, indelicately nicknamed the Maharaja of Yorkshire and facing questions over financial deals which made him a millionaire in his s, is the ventriloquist’s dummy. But Johnson’s honeymoon will end abruptlyLabour picks Lisa Nandy or Keir Starmer as party leader. Blue bricks in the red wall aren’t as solid as Tories like to pretend. Sajid Javid quitting as Chancellor exposed Johnson’s struggle to square satisfying London hedge fund fat cats and northern England’s grafters.  Posing both as a tax cutter and big public spender is a deceit that will end in spiralling debt and Tory tears. The sleaze probe over who paid Johnson’s £, Caribbean Christmas bill and criticism that he failed to visit Yorkshire’s flooded communities symbolise the private and public contempt of a chancer. It’s not lost “oop North” that Johnson pulled on his wellies before the election because votes were at stake. This side of that contest, he floats unhurried on an -seat majority with almost five more years in the bank.

newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA dad and jewellery seller from a small British seaside town has been unmasked as a former recruiter for a neo-Nazi hate group. Nicholas Waugh recruited new members for the now banned group National Action and was also linked to related alt-right group Scottish Dawn, promoting both through online pseudonym HaggiSS. While attempting to encourage overseas fascists to come take part in far-right protests in Britain, he had warned police would go out their way to be a******s to you.Waugh was identied after twisted online forum Iron March was hacked and content leaked by users leading to a joint probe by the Daily Record and website The Ferret. Waugh was named by Hope Not Hate as a National Action leader in Scotland but has denied the allegations and threatened to take legal action. He said: “The allegations stated and implied are  and irrelevant.” Data collected in the probe includes a swarm of comments and messages made by the businessman from Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, including orders for bundles of National Action stickers. He encouraged members to join demonstrations, including a Scottish Defence League protest in Edinburgh and a White Man March in Newcastle in . Waugh, who is married, built international links by contacting other fascists in Lithuania, Bulgaria and Australia, in attempts to get them to travel to protests in Britain, through the forum. The initial leak was posted anonymously online and contained the website’s database, which made it possible to match usernames with forum posts, direct messages and email, postal and IP addresses. Waugh was in contact with the founder of National Action, who used the name aposDaddy Terrorapos on Iron March. Scottish Dawn emerged shortly after National Action - which held street protests and ran a whites-only food bank in Glasgow before being proscribed under counter-terrorism laws - was stamped out more than three years ago.  The new group was then banned itself in September , following an undercover sting by The Ferret exposed its ties to the previous group, of which Waugh appears to have been a leading member. There is no suggestion, however, that he is currently involved. He said in one post in  that he was “trying to get Scotland up and running”, having made contact with National Action founder Ben Raymond, aka Daddy Terror in October , . HaggiSS wrote: “Hello, do you have a few bundles of stickers you can send my way  Meeting some Stormfags in November and one of them requested some so I thought I would try and get some to give out to them. Cheers. Nicholas.” Daddy Terror replied: “Hi, I only have the red and black kind but I am happy to send a load. Tell me how many you think you will want. I don’t appear to have an address for a Nicolas so let me know.” In reply, HaggiSS said his name was “N Waugh” and gave an address in Fraserburgh which helped us to identy him. He was in contact with a user called Aberfoyle, who claimed to live outside Glasgow, on August , . Waugh wrote: “There are a couple of NA guys down that way. If you stay in touch there might be something active eventually.” Waugh also told Aberfoyle he was: “Trying to get Scotland up and running” and offered to provide stickers. Aberfoyle asked what was expected of members and Waugh replied: “Anything really, it’s up to you how committed you become. Anything from handing out fliers and stickers to joining us on flash demos. I’m trying to arrange some sort of meeting between interested people in the Central Belt. “Right now we are mostly learning from our English comrades in regards to activism. We are not really organised yet.” Waugh also used the forum to cultivate international links. He offered masks to a Lithuanian fascist who was involved with a fascist group called Skydas.  In a conversation with a Bulgarian fascist, Waugh told him he was based in the “NE” area of Scotland.He was also in contact with Antipodean Resistance in Australia. On July , , Waugh talked about how Police Scotland handled demos.He wrote: “Police in Scotland are usually really courteous and understand the reds cause all the trouble, but go to Glasgowand they will go out their way to be a******s to you.” After National Action was proscribed, Waugh sought to distance himself but he became involved with Scottish Dawn despite acknowledging members of a proscribed group may be involved. In one exchange, he denied that Scottish Dawn was a continuation of National Action, stating they took “a drastically dferent approach”. Waugh was involved with Scottish Dawn but claimed not to be its leader. He actively promoted Scottish Dawn by asking a contact to advertise the new group on neo-Nazi website Stormfront. National Action was founded in  by Ben Raymond and Alex Davies.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Crown Prosecution Service can continue with a domestic violence charge eventhe victim doesnapost want the case to go - and hereaposs why. Questions have been raised about the CPSapos decision to pursue a case against Caroline Flack following the staraposs tragic death on Saturday.The former Love Island presenter was was being taken to court for assault following an alleged early-morning altercation with Caroline’s boyfriend Lewis Burton, , in December. Lewis refused to apospress chargesapos - essentially an American concept - but the CPS decided to pursue the case. Following her death, broadcast and talent agent Louisa McDonald released a statement on behalf of Carolineaposs management firm in which they criticised the CPSapos decision to pursue the high-profile case. The Crown Prosecution Service pursued this when they knew not only how very vulnerable Caroline was but also that the alleged victim did not support the prosecution and had disputed the CPS version of events, she said. The CPS should look at themselves today and how they pursued a show trial that was not only without merit but not in the public interest. And ultimately resulted in signicant distress to Caroline. Our thoughts are with Caroline’s family at this time. Francis Ridley, Money Talent Management. Asked about the criticism of the decision to prosecute Caroline, a CPS spokesman said: Our deepest sympathies go to the family and friends of Caroline Flack. Given the tragic circumstances, we will not comment on the specics of this case at this stage.  Nazir Afzal, a former Chief Crown Prosecutor, spoke to LBC about the case. He said the concept of prosecutions where the victim or complainant doesnapost want to pursue it is actually very common. Adding, itaposs not because itaposs Caroline Flack, it would happen dozens of times every week. This is because we as a country, he said, have decided that weaposre not handling domestic abuse very well. According to the CPSapos Domestic Violence: How prosecution decisions are reached document, they must be satisfied there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against each defendant on each charge.  If there is enough evidence, the case will proceed providing itaposs in the public interest - eventhe victim does wish the provide evidence or support the prosecution. We always think very carefully about the interests of the victim when we decide where the public interest lies. But we prosecute cases on behalf of the public at large and not just based on the interests of any articular inidual. There can be dficulties in striking this balance. The views and interests of the victim are important,but they cannot be the final word on the subject of a CPS prosecution. Any future risks to the victim, their children or any other potential victim have to be taken into consideration.  A case can proceed eventhe victim withdraws support or no longer wishes to give evidence. Sometimes, victims will ask the police not to proceed any further with the case and say that they no longer wish to give evidence. There may be a number of explanations for this. This does not mean that the case will automatically be stopped. The document then outlines that the more serious the offence, the more likely we are tho prosecute in the public interest, eventhe victim says that they do not wish us to do so. In cases where we have sufficient other evidence, we may decide to proceed without relying on the evidence of the victim at all. The CPS can continue to pursue a case eventhe parties involved have reconciled or the injury was minor.

company criticised the CPS for pursuing a \"show trial\" by charging her with attacking her boyfriend despite his oppositionShareCommentsByCatherine WylieLorraine King:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsCaroline was found dead at her London home on February  \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Daily Love IslandSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Crown Prosecution Service has outlined how it reaches decisions over whether or not to charge someone with a criminal offence following the death of Caroline Flack. The explanation came hours after the TV presenteraposs management company criticised the CPS for pursuing a show trial regarding her assault charge despite her boyfriend Lewis Burton saying he did not support it.The -year-old stepped down from presenting the current Love Island show after she was alleged to have assaulted Lewis, who is , at her then flat in Islington, north London, in December.She denied the charge at Highbury Corner Magistratesapos Court and was released on bail, with conditions that stopped her having any contact with Lewis ahead of a trial set for March . Caroline was found dead in her flat in east London on Saturday morning. She is said to have taken her own le. Her family confirmed that she had taken her own le. Hours after her death Francis Ridley, of Money Talent Management, said: The Crown Prosecution Service pursued this when they knew not only how very vulnerable Caroline was but also that the alleged victim did not support the prosecution and had disputed the CPS version of events. The CPS should look at themselves today and how they pursued a show trial that was not only without merit but not in the public interest. And ultimately resulted in signicant distress to Caroline.  In response, the CPS said its deepest sympathies go to the family and friends of Flack, but did not comment further. However, on Sunday, the CPS said it had been asked questions about the role of the CPS in deciding whether to charge an inidual with a criminal offence, adding: The following information explains our role and approach. It is not a comment on any inidual case. The CPS said: We do not decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence - that is for the jury, judge or magistrate - but we must make the key decision of whether a case should be put before a court. It said every charging decision is based on the same two-stage test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors:  - Does the evidence provide a realistic prospect of conviction  That means, having heard the evidence, is a court more likely than not to find the defendant guilty  And - Is it in the public interest to prosecute  That means asking questions including how serious the offence is, the harm caused to the victim, the impact on communities and whether prosecution is a proportionate response. The information they posted a link to included: Guidance for prosecutors when considering domestic abuse allegations gives specic advice on how to proceed when a complainant does not want to support a prosecution, which can often be a feature of these dficult cases. It provides guidance on the information required to understand why a complainant may withdraw support and the dferent options that should be considered, including proceeding without the complainantaposs supportother evidence is available.It sets out a number of factors which may be helpful when considering the public interest in whether to charge in these circumstances. In a section of the CPS website with the heading Retractions and withdrawals by complainants, it says: It is possible that a complainant may ask the police not to proceed any further with a prosecution case and say they no longer wish to give evidence. There may be a number of reasons why a complainant will withdraw their support from a prosecution, or retract their allegation, but this does not mean that the case will be automatically stopped.

Little Izzy Slack called  when she came across her mum Samantha Slack suffering an epileptic fit. The Northwood Broom Academy pupil found her mum, who suffers from epilepsy, in a serious condition in bed. She sprang into action and alerted the emergency services, who arrived at their Northwood home. Izzy, who remained calm and collected throughout the incident, recalled: “Mummy’s legs were shaking, so I got her phone and put in three s. I told them that mummy had one slipper on and one slipper off.She told Stoke-on-Trent Live: “I knew what to do and say because we have practised before. I rang again because the first ambulance wasn’t coming quickly enough. When they answered, I said ‘come quick’.“When they got to our house, I opened the door to let them in and they looked after mummy.” Now staff at Izzy’s school have described her as a ‘role model’ for other children. And they invited her on stage to collect the Esprit Academy Trust’s community award in front of her classmates and teachers. “I feel really proud of myself. I could see mummy in the audience when I got my award,” she said afterwards. The shiny new medal is engraved with her name and is on a purple ribbon. Samantha, aged , described her daughter’s actions as ‘absolutely amazing’. She said: “She’s my little diamond. She saved my le. “She’s known how to use my phone for years, ever since she was able to hold one. “I wanted to make sure that she knew what to domummy ever fell over, started shaking or wouldn’t wake up.  “She’s seen me having fits and being ill since she was a baby.

I’ve pretended to be the operator and Izzy will be the caller and we will practise what to say. “As soon as she was old enough to understand, I made sure that she knew her own address. I’m so beyond proud of her.” Samantha was taken to Royal Stoke University Hospital following the fit on February . She was discharged after being checked over. She added: “I’m used to having fits, it’s normal to me.

of bile duct cancer \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum who was given just six weeks to live has stunned medics by making a complete recovery and is now preparing to scale Mount Everest. Andrea Sheardown, , was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, a rare form of cancer occurring in the bile ducts, in  - and doctors told her there was nothing they could do for her, giving her just six weeks to live. But the mum-of-two, from Sandbach, Cheshire, refused to give up and sought a second opinion - when surgeons agreed to operate, and removed a tumour the size of a pineapple. Although doctors have warned her the aggressive cancer couldat any time, Andrea has refused to let her diagnosis stop her from living her le - and has gone on to complete a series of adrenaline-filled challenges. And this week, she is flying to Nepal to hike to Everest base camp with her husband, Chris, , her  year old son, Sam, her sister and  other loyal friends who she calls Andreaaposs AMMF Army, to reach the Everest Base Camp, which can take up to  days of trekking. Since being diagnosed in , Andrea has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, completed the three peaks challenge and cycled from Vietnam to Cambodia with her daughter, Amelia, . Andrea said: Since I began fundraising in , Iaposve managed to raise £, for the charity. The doctors have warned me that the cancer could come back at anytime but Iaposm trying to stay positive. Giving up wasnapost an option for me, I wanted to see my children grow up, be there for their key milestones in le - I had to stay strong for my family. People canapost believe that I have managed to do some of these things but le is all about challenging yourself - itaposs something I teach my kids and thataposs why they always come along with me. Iaposm so lucky with the support Iaposve received from family, friends, local businesses and even complete strangers. In , Andrea began experiencing severe pain in her rib cage which lasted for - weeks before she decided to go to AE at her local hospital due to the serverity of the pain.  After being told it was just indigestion, Andrea, who owns a magazine advertising business, was fed up and demanded she be given tests to find out what the problem was. Andrea was given blood tests, which came back as all clear. She was then given an x-ray, which was the first step in diagnosing her with cholangiocarcinoma. The x-ray showed a mass on her liver and following a week of CT and MRI scans, she was told by the hospital that there was aposnothing they could doapos and she was given just weeks to live. Left with no options, Andrea and her husband, Chris, went to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for a second opinion where they decided to offer Andrea a leline in agreeing to carry out intense surgery to remove the tumour from her liver which ended up being the size of a small pineapple. Andrea said: It was fantastic that the hospital offered me this leline, but it was also the hard work of my dad who trawled the internet in search of anything he could find out about this deadly cancer. He was the one that found the wonderful AMMF cancer charity. This then led us to other specialists in the cholangiocarcinoma field.  They didnapost know whether I would survive the operation so I took a risk because I thought, itaposs either this or Iaposm not going to be around for much longer. Iaposm so glad I took the risk becauseI hadnapost, I would have died. Once the tumour was removed, the doctors told Andrea that there was no way of making sure the cancer had gone completely as bile duct cancer doesnapost show up in blood tests. The hospital didnapost think Andrea would be strong enough to survive chemotherapy at the the time, but she felt strongly this route needed to be explored further, so she decided to go down the private care route which is when she found the Christie Clinic in Manchester. Andrea underwent six months of intense chemotherapy which resulted in her becoming weak and extremely frail.  However, in November , Andrea took on her first challenge after completing her course of chemotherapy: the three peak challenge. Andrea climbed Ben Nevis, m, Scafell Pike m and Snowdon, m where she managed to reach the peak to everyoneaposs amazement. I felt like people had almost written me off - they would bring me flowers and I hated that because I always associated flowers with funerals. Just because you have cancer, it doesnapost mean you should give up on le and when I found the AMMF charity, I knew that I wanted to start doing fundraising events because they helped me so much and more awareness needs to be raised about this type of cancer. Itaposs one of the deadliest and there is currently no cure. After climbing the three peaks in order to raise money for the AMMF charity, Andrea climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in February  and then cycled from Vietnam to Cambodia in February . During this time, Andrea and her AMMF army managed to raise £, for the charity.  Now, after being given the all clear in October , Andrea, along with her husband, her son, sister and a group of friends are flying out to reach Everest Base Camp on Thursday. Throughout all my treatment I have lived by the mantra of keep taking those steps no matter how small, eventhey are baby steps just keep taking them. I had never even climbed a mountain when I first started challenging myself.

But she and partner Gareth were shocked when they were told by HMRC they owed thousands back to the government due to commission he had received from his job as a recruitment consultant. A rule is in place whereby iniduals who earn more than £, have to pay back a certain amount of their child benefit in income tax. And earnings that tip them over the threshold can come from money earned as commission, overtime, bonuses or even a company car allowance. Gareth works as a recruitment consultant and didn’t realise that his commission had tipped him over the edge, Lorraine, who runs Mini First Aid classes, told Birmingham Live. “It’s the fact it came out of the blue that was so annoying,we had known we would have cancelled immediately! she said. We always follow all the rules and don’t try to cheat at anything. It seems HMRC are getting a nice tidy sum from something that they could have easily adjusted. Many of our friends experienced this too, so it seems weaposre not a minority! We received no notication, we were just told we had a £, debt. Then when we questioned it, they added on an additional fine for delayed payment. She added: The tax office said he was supposed to have sent self assessment tax s but he didn’t think he had to do this because he’s not self employed. He’s never had to do that before. “It gets set up automatically and then you just forget about it. It worked out to be around three years worth that we owed. It had been coming in for such a long time, around £ a month that we didn’t really notice it going in. They said we could pay it back in installments over a year but that’s quite a short timeframe. It’s money we could have spent on a holiday. The rule, which was brought in back in  but is not very well known, currently means families have to pay back one per cent for every £ they earn over the threshold. And Lorraine is not the first parent to be caught unawares by this rule. Richard and Rebekha Nicholls, from Grimsby, were told to pay back a hefty £, after encountering the same problem. In that case, Richardaposs company car was what tipped them over the limit. An HMRC spokesperson said customers liable to the High Income Child Benefit Charge can elect to opt out of receiving payments of Child Benefit and still receive the other advantages of claiming it. This includes protecting their NI contributions record, as well as ensuring their child receives an NI number in the future. They said: “We use a wide array of channels to reach those who may be liable to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Kay believes thousands and thousands across the world canapost be wrong. Kay was  and in the Royal Logistics Corps when she went under the kne at a private Birmingham clinic.

It started affecting my mental health, Iaposd get really bad brain fog, Kay continued. Iaposd be talking to a client and completely forget what I was saying. You start to panic, I had no answers. Things came to a head in December when Kay went for a massage. They pushed too hard, she said. I got really bad pain in my breast and armpit. I thought it might have ruptured. I said aposI really need to get these ones out and new ones inapos.  By chance, Kay read about Breast Implant Illnessonline.

Stories began pouring in from women all over the UK, who identied with the symptoms Kay described and felt like they were losing their mind. Some have told how they lost their jobs, their families and can barely get out of bed some days. One woman had been sectioned, says Kay. I can totally understand how it makes you lose your mind. I have pushed my husband to a point. Iaposm lucky that heaposs stood by me. Kay said that as breast implants are not regulated, she could easily have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia or other conditionsdoctors did not understand the implants were the problem. Not one doctor asked meI had implants, she continued. This needs to be changed. It has to be proven. For me, there are thousands and thousands of women all over the world. They canapost all be wrong. I want to make people aware, it is time this is recognised. Implant removal should be widely available on the NHS, she claims. Itaposs classed as self-inflicted, she says. But so is smoking. You donapost get them in, thinking youaposre going to be poorly. Sheaposs still bandaged and sore from the op, but now Kay can breathe easier - literally - after the sharp chestbone pains she felt with every inhalation disappeared overnight. Thataposs the first thing Iaposve noticed, she said. It was part of my le, Iaposd got used to it.  But it went straightaway. I feel clearer in my head, more positive.  Iaposm taking each day as it comes. The -year-old has no idea how sheaposs going to feel, or how her breasts will look afterwards, but sheaposs not that bothered. Iaposd looked at a lot of pictures [of others], some were good, some were bad. I never appreciated my body at all. Iaposve always been quite hard on myself. At the end of the day, Iaposve got three young children and a husband and your health is more important. Getting my boobs done didnapost change the way I felt about my body. Many people,  including women in Billingham who Kay knows, have come forward with the same symptoms, which is scary, Kay says. She told one woman who was planning a removal to make sure the aposcapsuleapos surrounding her implants was sent off to be tested - and sheaposs calling for the practice to be made compulsory.

Laura Rudd says her “world came crashing down” when she came across paramedics desperately trying to save her partner Nigel Glanville, as she went out searching for him while clutching their two-year-old boy. She had become worried after -year-old Nigel failed tohome from run on Saturday, February . The dad collapsed in the street near his home in Wilberfoss, Yorkshire, after suffering a heart attack. He was pronounced dead at the scene. But, while trying to grieve for the loss of her partner of almost a decade, Laura was shocked to find she was left to fend for herself financially.She has now launched a campaign to end the “heartless discrimination” unmarried parents suffer when their partners die, Hull Live reports.“I found the ambulance when I went out to look for Nigel with our little boy Noah,” said Laura, “and from there, our world came crashing down. “I lost the love of my le and our little boy lost his daddy at an age when he is far too young to grasp what that means. He just thinks his daddy is hiding and keeps asking when he is going to come home.” Almost immediately following Nigel’s death, Laura found herself thrust into legal limbo, despite being his partner for the last nine years and the mother of their toddler son. Grieving families are still being denied benefits of up to £, because the government only makes support payments to married couples – despite a decision in the Supreme Court  months ago that ruled its position was unlawful. Laura Rudd, , has launched a campaign to finally change the law. “Instead of spending Valentine’s Day with Nigel,” Laura said, “I had to register his death and begin to organise his funeral. It was a truly low point in the worst week of my le. “However, I struggled to even complete the paperwork and was recorded as ‘person organising funeral’, rather than his partner or the mother of his child. “According to the law, I donapost count. I even had to register him as ‘single’.  It was a spit in the face for nearly a decade spent together, simply because in the eyes of the law Noah and I aren’t even recognised.” Laura and Nigel had recently bought a house together and now the schoolteacher faces paying the mortgage alone while juggling childcare for her son. She must also find around £, to pay for Nigel’s funeral, which she does not have. To make matters worse, she discovered she is not eligible for financial support that would have been made available had she and Nigel tied the knot or been in a civil partnership. Bereavement support payment was introduced in April  to replace three separate payments - widowed parent’s allowance, bereavement payment and bereavement allowance. It is paid as a lump sum of up to £, and then at a rate of up to £ a month for the first  months after the death. Those who lost a partner before the rule change can continue to claim the older benefits until their children leave full-time education or they move in with a new partner. However, anyone who loses a partner to whom they were not married is not entitled to make a claim. There are . million cohabiting couples in the UK, and of these about . million have children. “All for the sake of a piece of paper, I get nothing,” Laura said.  “I am nothing – I count as nothing and neither does our child, our beautul son, who is not yet even three years old. On top of losing him, worrying about finances and everything , I now have to find £, from somewhere to pay for his funeral. “To me, this is blatant, heartless discrimination, adding to an already painful process. How is this still happening in   “Thousands of people across the UK every week must be facing this same predicament that I now face, and it is just not good enough.” In August , the Supreme Court ruled that denying an unmarried mother of four children widowed parent’s allowance amounted to discrimination, in a decision that was expected to extend the rights of unmarried couples.

Their needs, and more importantly their children’s needs, are the same.” However,  months on, there has been no change in the law.

Distraught Chrystelle Taylor and her two-year-old, Taomi, have have aposlost everythingapos in the disaster when the rain-swollen River Taff burst its banks. The -year-old, from Taffaposs Well, north of Cardf, was woken up in the early hours of Sunday as the town flooded amid a red aposdanger to leapos warning for rain. She told WalesOnline:It was the scariest wake-up call Iaposve ever received. I have lived there two and a half years and we have had slight flooding in the area but nothing like I witnessed today. Follow our Storm Dennis live blog for the latest updates. Luckily I was able to escape through my mumaposs house. I live in a basement apartment which only has one way in and one one way out. If my mum wasn’t my neighbour I would’ve been trapped We had to leave the house with absolutely nothing. All we have is the clothes on our backs.But the support we have had has been amazing.

We would have been killed without it.aposapos Dramatic pictures taken by Laurence from the scene on the A at Sturminster Marshall show just how lucky his family including his children, Max, , Isabella, nine, and Rex, three, were. He said: aposaposMy we is a bit battered and has two black eyes, a bump on the head and bruising to her chest but apart from that we escaped unscathed. aposaposWe were driving along and out of the corner of my eye I saw the tree coming down. The car was on Autopilot and the emergency breaking kicked in.  aposaposIt was chaos with smoke coming from the car and people shouting to get out.

It was an amazing response. aposaposPower lines came down and there were live wires at the back of the car so we were getting everyone to safety while being careful of them. aposaposMy we thought she was going to die when she saw the tree fall. I canapost believe weaposre all still alive. Elon Musk has done us proud.aposapos Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system that enhances safety behind the wheel.  external cameras, a radar,  ultrasonic sensors and a powerful onboard computer provide an additional layer of safety to guide drivers on their journey.  Autopilot uses these features to see and sense the environment around the car. This robust sensor and camera suite provides drivers with an awareness of their surroundings that a driver alone would not otherwise have. A powerful onboard computer processes these inputs in a matter of milliseconds to help make your driving safer and less stressful. Active safety features made possible by Teslaaposs Autopilot hardware and software system include Automatic Emergency Braking which detects cars or obstacles that the car may impact and applies the brakes accordingly. Speaking about the other car, Laurence, from Brentwood, Essex, said: aposaposIn an amazing one a million chance another Tesla Model X car was also hit on the other side of the tree. The police have told me that all three are fine so nine lives have quite literally saved due to this amazing car.aposapos Construction company director Josh Whitelock, , from Wimborne, was driving the other Tesla with his girlfriend, Kitty McConnell and her mum, Julia as passengers when the tree came down.  aposaposI was on Autopilot driving home when I saw a flash from the power line which lit up the tree as it fell. We stopped suddenly. There was a loud crack and then the sound of metal on metal.aposaposI was expecting to turn around and see my girlfriend and her mother impaled by branches but incredibly that wasnapost the case. They were both ok apart from a bit of whiplash. It was a miracle we all survived. aposaposI helped get them both out of the car and then checked on the other driver on the other side of the tree. When I saw the open Falcon door I couldnapost believe it.  aposaposWe were just in pure shock. Tesla has saved eight lives. aposaposIt just goes to show that le can be over in a split second but thanks to Tesla making amazing cars that wasnapost the case this time.aposapos Laurence said he was so thankful to the local community who came to the familyaposs aid. aposaposOur car has been written off but the landowner has given us his Range Rover Sport to use until we get sorted.  aposaposAnother couple who saw what happened, Tony and Olga from Vines Farm took us to their home and kept the kids entertained and fed and watered us.aposapos Storm Dennis continues to batter the country this morning. Eight aposdanger to leapos severe flood warnings have been issued but the Government cannot protect every household, the Environment Secretary said. The UKaposs fourth named storm of the winter saw a monthaposs worth of rain in  hours and rampant mph winds this weekend, which led to three deaths.  A red weather warning - the highest threat level - was put in place yesterday by the Met Office as homes in Cardf were evacuated after the River Taff burst its banks and forecasters have warned several more days of misery will likely follow. It comes a week after Britain was brought to its knees by Storm Ciara which also caused chaos across the country. But new Environment Secretary George Eustice has told Sky News the Government will not be able to protect every house from flooding.  He was adamant, however, that the floods caused by Storm Dennis had not caught Westminster off guard. Thataposs despite criticism from within the Conservative Party, that not enough has been learnt since the floods in . The Environment Agency has has doubled its severe flood warnings count for Monday in a matter of hours, with isolated properties near the River Lymn and Steeping just one of eight areas at risk.

Following in her late mother-in-law Princess Dianaaposs footsteps, Kate welcomed all three of her children at the Lindo Wing at St Maryaposs Hospital in London. But in the lead up to welcoming her first child she was also forced to spend time in hospital after suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum - extreme morning sickness. In her most revealing interview yet, she told Giovanna Fletcheraposs podcast Happy Mum, Happy Baby that she didnapost want to hang around there any longer than she had to. Asked how long she had between giving birth and posing on the Lindo Wing steps, Kate said: Oh my gosh, I can’t remember. Everything goes in a bit of a blur. I think, yeah I did stay in hospital overnight, I remember it was one of the hottest days and night with huge thunderstorms so I didn’t get a huge amount of sleep, but George did which was really great. I was keen to get home because, for me, being in hospital, I had all the memories of being in hospital because of being sick so it wasn’t a place I wanted to hang around in.  So, I was really desperate to get home and get back to normality. Kate opened up about her dficult pregnancies saying she felt utterly rotten during all three. She said: It was fine. I got very bad morning sickness, so I’m not the happiest of pregnant people.  "},{"url":null,"title":"woman who drank 10 cans","story":"w.mantis  Woman who drank  cans of Irn-Bru a day loses st after switching to sugar-free n Shannon Palmer, , turned to fizzy drinks for comfort after her childhood home nearly burnt down and she was made redundant, all in the space of two days  n A carer who drank  cans of Irn-Bru a day to cope with ­losing her home and job has shed st lb – after switching to sugar-free.  nShannon Palmer, , had her le turned “upside down” after her childhood home was burned down, and she was made redundant the next day.  nThe fizzy pop addict fell into a “deep depression”, turning to ­takeaways and Irn-Bru for comfort.  nShe ballooned from a size  to a size , tipping the scales at st by the summer of .  nShannon felt “afraid” to wear a bikini on a  holiday in Spain – and vowed to transform her le.  nHer Instagram page detailing her weight loss, @thelittleleofshazzap, has almost , followers.  nRecalling the  house fire, ­triggered by a tumble dryer ­explosion, she said: “I was heartbroken, we lost everything.

The American woman was confirmed to have contracted the deadly disease following tests in Malaysia after traveling on the Holland America Line-owned Westerdam cruise ship. The cruise line, which is owned by cruise giant Carnival Corp, said none of the other , passengers and  crew have reported any symptoms. Guests who have already ed home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information, a statement from the company said. Passengers had been cleared to travel by Cambodian authorities after health checks when the cruise ship docked on Thursday. It had spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand. But on Saturday, Malaysia said an American woman who arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Friday on a chartered flight had tested positive for the new coronavirus that has killed more than , people - mostly in China.  The womanaposs husband tested negative for the flu-like virus. About  of the  passengers on the chartered flight had already left for other countries as of yesterday after showing no signs of illness, Malaysian authorities said. Dozens more of the Westerdam passengers had flown through Thailand and onward to other countries, Thai officials said. At least  passengers and  crew remain aboard the vessel off the Cambodian port city of Sihanoukville, Holland America said.  Others were in hotels in Phnom Penh, the capital. Holland America said it is working with health officials in Malaysia and Cambodia and experts in the U.S. Centers for Disease Controland the World Health Organization . These experts are working with the appropriate national health authorities to investigate and follow-up with iniduals who may have come in contact with the guest, said Dr Grant Tarling, Chief Medical Officer for Holland America Line.  Several hundred other passengers who left the ship are still in Cambodia, according to passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwe from Fort Myers, Florida. I believe thereaposs  Americans here at this hotel plus a few hundred from other countries. We will all be tested for the coronavirus today and tomorrow by the Cambodian Ministry of Health, Rauen told Reuters on Sunday. We have no idea when we get to get home but Holland America is working on all of our flight reservations. We have ambassadors from the U.S. Embassy here in Phnom Penh as well as from Australia and other countries to help people figure out what to do, she said. The coronavirus death toll in mainland China reached , on Sunday, up by  from the previous day, the countryaposs National Health Commission has said. Across mainland China, there were , new confirmed infections on Sunday. The total accumulated number so far has reached ,. The latest rise in the number of reported new cases of coronavirus in Hubei after two days of falls, comes as authorities imposed tough new restrictions on movement to prevent the spread of the disease. Westerdam passengers flung up their arms in joy after finally disembarking over the weekend following two weeks stranded onboard, with the ship initially declared free of coronvirus despite  people falling ill. But the misery continued for a British family and others from the US vessel, which had been stuck for two weeks in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. Their flights were suddenly cancelled when an -year-old American fell ill on a flight and tested positive for the virus. It meant those still in Cambodia faced going back to quarantine. Lorraine Oliveira, husband Carlos and their children Jonathan, , and Aoe nine, from the Wirral, Merseyside, found themselves trapped. Psychotherapist Lorraine, , said: “Loads of passengers were waiting for their flight confirmations when the captain made an announcement.

Paul Hartley played him further back in front of me and whoever I was partnering but I always felt he was more of a threat further up the pitch.“He creates real problems for defenders because they don’t know whether to follow him when he naturally drops back.“What Gowser does is take real care of the ball when he’s got it and he turns and can see a pass.“The ball he played through for Kane Hemmings’ second goal had to be right and he set the goal up.“I was delighted with Gowser up front and with Kane next to him.”With striking options limited following Danny Johnson’s departure in January and Andrew Nelson’s surgery, James says that plan would have been put to use the previous week against Morton.However, a knock picked up in training ruled McGowan out of the draw at Cappielow.And it was sporting director Gordon Strachan who reminded the Dark Blues manager of the possibility.McGowan started his career at Celtic while Strachan was manager at Parkhead and was given his debut in an advanced position.James added: “It’s something we would have done earlierwe could have.“We probably would have done it at Morton.“He started his career out there. That’s what Gordon keeps saying to me.“He played there when Gordon was at Celtic.“Gordon gave him his debut. He played in the Champions League for him against Villareal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dens gaffer players have to pay back dundee fans","story":"Dundee boss James McPake expects his players to give the club’s fans something back in the last few months of the season as they target a second-place finish.It’s been a trying first season as a manager for the -year-old at Dens Park with form and fortunes of his side fluctuating from week to week.After two positive results in their last two outings – a - draw at Cappielow against Morton followed up by a commanding - success over bottom side Partick Thistle – the Dark Blues gaffer is hard at work trying to stretch those reults into an extended run of form that can see Dundee earn themselves a place in the end-of-season play-offs.At times, the club’s fans have voiced their frustration at the team’s inability to prove any sort of challenge to runaway leaders Dundee United.James understands that but was pleased to see another side to the home support in last weekend’s win over the Jags.“We gave them a reason to get behind us,” he said.“Early in the game, Kane Hemmings chased a ball down, it rebounds off the defender and we get a throw-in – everybody is buzzing just because Kano chased a ball.“The supporters are then up for it and they see the players are up for it, too, with balls into the box early on.”That was a prime example of the players getting the crowd onside and the manager is demanding more of that, particularly with four home games coming up in the six matches after next Saturday’s trip to Queen of the South.Arbroath and Alloa are a home double-header before Dunfermline and then Queens check in to Dens before the end of March.“We have to give them something to be proud of – I said as much in my first interview,” he added.“I think last Saturday the fans were proud of their team.“We might not have knocked the ball about or played as fluently as we have this season but we got the three points and came away with a clean sheet and looked really comfortable.“The fans will have walked away really happy.“I think that was probably the first time at Dens this season where they walked away saying ‘it was good today’.“We have to do that, it has to come from us.“The fans will help us when it’s backs to the wall but we need to give them something.“Last Saturday we did.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e32aa8eca4016.34594020.jpg ","title":"james mcpake weve not scored enough set pieces","story":"James McPake wants his Dundee side to become set-piece masters to help them grab the coveted second spot in the Championship.The Dens Park gaffer was delighted to see his team open the scoring last weekend against Partick directly from a corner, something he says hasn’t happened nearly enough.James said: “We’ve not scored enough from set-pieces and we have been working on that.“With three at the back like against Partick, we are a bigger side.“With Christophe Berra, Josh Meekings and Jordon Forster they have three big men to pick up and we have more targets.“We haven’t scored enough from set-plays for the size we are and the time we spend working on that.”Defensively, James was delighted to see the Dark Blues earn just their second clean sheet since the end of October. vw, px\"  “Our three centre-backs cruised it,” he added.“Christophe didn’t get out of second gear. Not because he isn’t fit enough, because he didn’t need to.“He’s a top defender and that’s why he’s got so many Scotland caps and why he’s played so many years in England.“You could see his influence on the other defenders and the midfielders in front of him.“He’s calm, composed and carries himself very well. You see the leadership qualities he’s got.“Christophe carries himself so well. He has a great manner and when he walks into the place he has a presence.“You can see that on the pitch.

She would be so proud.“Even more importantly for us as a family is that Academy Street Dance Studio will continue to run and that’s a legacy it its own.“She always called the studio her extended family and that’s how it still is.”Offshore safety expert Mr Rae said: “When I was informed that I was chosen I was in disbelief.“As an Aberdonian born and bred it fills me with pride to be recognised as one of its everyday heroes.”Clan fundraiser Mr Taylor said: “I am shocked and also honoured to have been chosen for this award and I would like to thank my family and friends that nominated me.”Mr Brown said: “I’m delighted and humbled to be honoured by my city of birth and raising awareness of Clare’s Law is invaluable.”And Mr Ritchie added: “It feels amazing to be recognised in this way – thanks so much to everyone that nominated me.”Aberdeen Inspired community and environmental co-ordinator Angela Joss said: “While working on this project it became obvious to us that the everyday heroes had changed Aberdeen and the community around them.“We have six examples of amazing Aberdonians and it makes me really proud to be one.”Lord Provost of Aberdeen Barney Crockett praised the scheme and said each of those honoured was a “fabulous ambassador” for the city.And Mike Melvin, ACVO co-ordinator who was on the judging , said: “All nominations were outstanding and very inspiring.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Their health suffers and the prospect of developing economically remains out of reach. For women and young girls, the consequences can be even worse, with many being attacked and raped when they use outdoor spaces. Girls are also removed from school when they reach puberty because of the lack of safe facilities.Through Toilet Twinning, it costs £ to build a toilet for an inidual family and £ to provide a block of toilets for a school or a displaced peoples camp.To raise vital funds, the group will host a coffee morning at Ardrishaig Parish Church Hall on Saturday January  and invites everyone to go along as it #helps to change the world, one toilet at a time#."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor january 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,in  The Argyllshire Advertiser ran a story entitled #Skate park pipe dream a reality for Lochgilphead#. Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

Peatlands are renowned for their ability to soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, to promote bioersity and to provide high quality water.The Thurso-based scientists will benefit from access to the Flow Country, the largest blanket bog in Europe and a region that is under consideration for World Heritage Site status ndash joining the ranks of Australiarsquos Great Barrier Reef, the Grand Canyon in America and the Taj Mahal in India.The project will also support new initiatives across the universityrsquos research centres and foster national and international collaborations, including work with Canadian peatland research groups.Dr Andersen said: ldquoPeatlands are the Earthrsquos most efficient terrestrial carbon store.

However, unprecedented efforts to restore our blanket bogs are under way, for example through the Peatland Action programme in Scotland.ldquoAstonishingly, we do not know the extent to which these interventions work or how blanket bogs, restored or otherwise, will cope with the added threat of climate change.ldquoI am thrilled to have been chosen by the Leverhulme Trust for this Research Leadership Award. I look forward to working with my team to pioneer approaches from molecular to landscape scales to fill some of these gaps in our knowledge and to inform UK and global peatland management strategies.The project will focus on three key areas of research. The team will explore how environmental conditions can affect Sphagnum mosses, one of the building blocks of peat in blanket bog.They will continue to develop a method that uses satellite data to measure how the seasonal patterns of swelling and shrinking of bog surface, known as ldquobog breathing, change in response to climate extremes and restoration activities. They will also work to refine models that predict how blanket bogs may respond to dferent management approaches in future climate change scenarios.Emma Goodyer, manager of the International Union For The Conservation Of Nature Uk Peatland Programme, said: ldquoThe area covered by near natural peatland worldwidestores more carbon than all other vegetation types in the world combined.

The research hub in the Flow Country has been instrumental in delivering programmes of research that tackle some of the most pressing issues for peatland restoration and policy.

Wersquove got the -bed hospital, the home of the medical school, wersquove got the universityrsquos research home here itrsquos already a melting pot of amazing people and amazing work, said Ms Stamp.She added: ldquoBioQuarter can be a lot more again and that is the transformational vision we have: to take BioQuarter today and its amazing attributes and put it on to the global path, to expand signicantly in terms of its numbers, in terms of who we attract, the types of innovators we want to attract.An architect by training, Ms Stamp said the scheme under development will include all the elements of a good place.ldquoIt will be a place where people want to work, to play, to discover hellip we train the next generation of doctors here, the next generation of innovators so we want to attract the absolute best students, so a place where you would want to spend your seven yearrsquos training.The plan should provide a signicant boost to the regeneration of south-east Edinburgh, with improved transport links and job opportunities for local people in prospect.A lot of work is being done to build links with the local community.

Itrsquos not just the Simpsons and Listers and people of the past, itrsquos the work thatrsquos coming out of the research just now, itrsquos amazing and BioQuarter has played and will continue to play a really critical role in that.By having a major hospital, research and business facilities in close proximity, BioQuarter helps secure advances in medical science and healthcare and to support the effort to commercialise promising technology.The commercialisation centre is home to ten spin outs including contract research specialist Aquila BioMedical and there is demand for space from other businesses.Research giant buys stake in BioQuarter-based businessAs a senior member of the estates department at Edinburgh university Ms Stamp led work on research facilities that helped underline the potential of the BioQuarter, before being appointed in August to lead on the expansion plan.The buildings she worked on in her estates role include the poundm Centre for Regenerative Medicine.Ms Stamp previously led on the regeneration of the Easter Bush Campus, where the Roslin Institute and the universityrsquos vet school stand on what were muddy fields.Having worked in senior positions in the public and private sectors Ms Stamp is confident that both will benefit from the Bio Quarter.Launched in , the BioQuarter is backed by NHS Lothian, Edinburgh university, the City of Edinburgh Council and Scottish Enterprise, which brings le science business development expertise.Around pound million has been invested in facilities on the site or those that are under development.Ms Stamp believes the right private sector players could allow the expansion of the development to proceed on a scale and at a speed that the public sector on its own might not be able to match.Before starting work at Edinburgh university in , Ms Stamp spent six interesting years at employee-owned John Lewis which she describes as an amazing company.ldquoYou are a partner from day one, there was a sense of family, a sense that you belonged to the business and that it was yours that gave you an amazing grounding.After completing her architectural training with John Lewis, Ms Stamp rose to a position which meant she played an important part in the development of major new stores such as one in the giant Bluewater complex in Kent.She was pleased to be chosen to lead work on the redesign of the John Lewis branch in the old St James Centre in Edinburgh,  miles from her native North Berwick.That meant having a big influence on a building that family members and friends had shopped in for years.Ms Stamp thinks the huge St James Quarter development which is under way in Edinburgh represents a welcome improvement on the tired St James Centre which it will replace.As changes in the retail world mean centres that only house shops could face a struggle the inclusion of hotels should help underpin the viability of the St James Quarter development.Her work on the BioQuarter expansion means she could play a key role in the development of another project that leaves a lasting impression on the city of Edinburgh.Ms Stamp wants to remain involved in regeneration work in future. As a senior figure in the building world she hopes to make an impact in other ways. These include helping to ensure the construction industry gives women a fairer deal.ldquoI think the construction industry is really failing in how it promotes females hellip I can interview contractors all day and sometimes not a single female walks through the door.QAWhat countries have you most enjoyed travelling to, for business or leisure, and why Hong Kong ndash as part of my architecture course back in the rsquos I was able to live and work in Hong Kong for a year.

The retail industry was changing rapidly at the time because of the recession and John Lewis embraced this with an ambitious programme of building large stores across the UK delivered in partnership with contractors and developers. This opened an avenue of opportunity for a rookie architect to be involved with and eventually lead large construction projects so early on in my career and learn the business of construction from both the client and investors perspective.What was your worst moment in business When you lead a project for it to be a success you have put your heart and soul into it. So when projects get scrapped it can be quite devastating. Sadly, this happens often in construction industry as funding is not secured or needs change. I am not sure it is something you ever get used to.Who do you most admire and why The architect Zaha Hadid who sadly died in  ndash she was the first woman to win a RIBA Royal Gold Medal in her own right. As a student we studied no female architects and during my career there have only been a few prominent female role models in architecture and construction.

Ministerrsquos Questions to ask Boris Johnsonhe would consider lsquoa change in the law to allow vulnerable addicts to consume substances in secure facilities under medical supervision.rsquoFor those not aware of such facilities, Sheppard is referencing the highly sought-after piloting of a supervised drug consumption facility .Supervised drug consumption facilities are places where illicit drugs can be used under the supervision of trained staff, who can intervene in the event of an overdose, and are typically used by people who inject drugs.:Charities want consumption room for drug users in GlasgowThe evidence has shown that the facilities reduce drug-related litter, connect users with health care professionals, save livesand reduce the spread of blood borne diseases, such as HIV and Hepatitis.The facilitation of an SDCF has been the subject of much controversy, with Scotland long pushing for the piloting of one to no avail.It was much to the surprise of some tuning in, therefore, that the question was not dismissed out of hand by Johnson.Instead, he pointed to an upcoming drug summit, due to be held in Scotland later this month.Few details about this summit have been revealed since then.What we do know is that it will be held in Glasgow on February , it will be chaired by the relevant minister Kit Malthouse, and that Professor Dame Carole Black, who is carrying out an independent review of drugs for the government, will be presenting her findings.It is not just the public, but the ruling party of Scotland and Glasgow Council who also seem to be in the dark about plans for the summit, with Holyrood Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick recently stating in an article published in The National that he is lsquovery surprised that the UK Government announced a summit in Glasgow without any consultation with the Scottish Government and Glasgow.rsquoWith relations between Westminster and Holyrood at a record low, and the lsquoyesrsquo vote once again on the rise, it seems the communication channels between the two government hubs have brokendown.:Westminster lsquostanding in the way of saving livesrsquo on Glasgow safe drug consumption roomPessimists might suggest that this indicates Scotland is no closer to the devolved drug powers it has long been seeking, which would allow for alternative policy approaches, such as a SDCF pilot in Glasgow.A recent UK government statement confirmed that it currently has no plans to introduce SDCFs.However, a few indicators suggest that this position could soonchange.The same statement goes on to say that ldquoillegal drugs devastate lives and communities and those who sell drugs will face the full consequences of the law.The emphasis on the lsquosellingrsquo of drugs implies that the government no longer sees the prosecution of drug users as a priority and will instead be going after the dealers.This approach could chime well with the public, with drug-related deaths at an all time high inScotland.A supervised consumption facility would allow the Tories to be lsquotough on crimersquo by pursuing drug dealers, but sympathetic to those in the throes of homelessness and addiction.Meanwhile, the drugs summit provides an opportunity for the Conservative government to better understand and respond effectively to the Scottish perspective and experience, demonstrating that the countryrsquos needs can be met within the union. Scotland has experienced record-high levels of drug-related deaths, with Glasgow city centre at the heart of it.From a policy perspective too, the move would be feasible.The political climate is ripe for such an announcement given the shocking levels of drug-related deaths. In addition, Johnson is barely two months into a five-year term with a huge majority so he can afford to adopt bold policy positions.The practicalities too should not pose many issues.Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership has been preparing for the introduction of a SDCF since  and the city is primed for implementation.With the summit taking place in a city renowned for anti-Tory sentiment and one of the epicentres of the current drug death crisis, it would be fitting for Glasgow to play host to the summit which could engineer the change of policy that the city has long been crying out for.At a time when the opposition party has lost all but one seat in Scotland, surely the strategy for the Tories must be to capitalise on the low hanging fruit and facilitate the piloting of live-saving safer drug consumption facilities Ant Lehane is Communications Officer of drug policy organisation Volteface.

Winter is a tough time for wild birds, but as spring approaches, and the weather becomes warmer, we should expect to hear more tweeting in our gardens.The company is asking keen photographers to share their snaps, with a chance to win a gt card for the store. Daniel Bingham, senior pets buyer for Wilko, offered some advice on helping wild birds thrive during the colder season.He said: “Birds feed every day and don’t store energy well, so one or two bad days in cold weather or without food can be very dangerous for them.“Put out a good selection of food in feeders or on tables to attract birds to your garden — things like fat balls are nutritious and high in energy — perfect to help them maintain weight and stay fuelled.“Put some soft food down for the songbirds who can’t reach the feeders. Suet blocks and pellets work particularly well, as they give the birds a great energy boost and plenty of calories.“Don’t forget to provide fresh water. Ponds, puddles and other water sources may freeze over, making them inaccessible to birds. Birds can be timid so you’ll need to be patient build up trust by sharing plenty of treats and you could soon be rewarded with the perfect wild bird shot”.The Wilko wild bird competition runs until March . All photographs should be taken in a garden or outdoor setting and must have been taken by you.Entries can be emailed to wildbirdcompetition@wearebrazenprcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt.

He has urged the Scottish Government to take the issue of fly-tipping more seriously, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the incidents.Speaking later, Mr Halcro Johnston said: “Rural communities, like many across the Highlands and Islands, are particularly vulnerable to the utterly irresponsible and, of course, criminal activity of fly-tipping.“Incidents can cause real distress, as well as serious environmental concerns, for those communities blighted by fly-tipping. And the problem is often compounded when the waste which is dumped is not removed and then attracts even more incidents.“While fly-tipping is often carried out by a small number of offenders, too few of those responsible are being brought to justice. With both Police Scotland and local council budgets squeezed, that undoubtedly impacts on efforts to identy and prosecute offenders, as well as hampering efforts to clean up blighted areas.“The importance of a clean and attractive environment to the health and well-being of local residents is often overlooked. Many are rightly proud of their local communities and are left angry at those who fly-tip, as well as frustrated at efforts to combat it.“The Scottish Government needs to ensure there is a greater emphasis on tacking the scourge of fly-tipping, bringing to book those responsible for it, and making sure Police Scotland and local councils are properly resourced to do so”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In , Tavish Scott and I voted to support the budget.“Since then, however, the SNP has sought to backslide on this commitment and short change the communities in Orkney and Shetland. This year, that amounts to a shortfall of £m.“It is not good enough for SNP Ministers to claim they are open to negotiationthey so brazenly fail to honour the commitments they have made in previous negotiations. What trust can anyone have in the promises they make “Derek Mackay may have had to fall on his sword but the commitments he made to fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles was one made on behalf of the government as a whole. It is one that must now be delivered: no s and no buts.”Ms Wishart added: “The principle of fair ferry funding was not only accepted by this SNP government, it also reflected the will of the parliament.“Any responsible Government budgets for basic leline services needed across the country.

The second advert, due to be screened in the spring, will showcase Orkney’s lestyle, along with work and study opportunities in the county.The adverts comprise footage created by Orkney-based digital content agency, Start Point Media, as part of the Digital Media Orkney Project, a three-year Orkney Marketing Programme initiative funded by LEADER, Highlands and Islands Enterpriseand Orkney Islands Council .Editing and advert composition was undertaken by STV as part of its Growth Fund initiative, aimed at encouraging Scottish businesses and organisations to advertise on the channel.Morag Robertson, economic development officer at OIC, said: “We decided to create these impactful television adverts with the backing of STV’s Growth Fund and the LEADER programme, as a complement to our marketing activities and as a way of driving more visitors to the official Orkney website, Orkney.

One by one, they planted the rough wooden memorials in the grass –  in all – each one marking a le lost to drugs. As they did so, they reflected on the good times, and lamented the waste.The last to plant his cross was Steven Currie. Steven’s older brother Peter McGrattan – known to most as Big Ped – was obsessed by music. “He was into punk when he was a boy, then U, Inspiral Carpets, Stone Roses, Oasis,” says Steven, who has the word “Brother” tattooed on his arm. “He was the man for the music, and you would follow suit because you looked up to him.” Steven would sit on the floor while Peter played DJ. “I’d tap tap my feet and think: ‘That’s quite good, that.’ His taste was superb. He could have been one of those guys that spotted bands.”But Big Ped carried a bit of weight and it affected his self-esteem. He trod that well-worn path from alcohol through soft drugs, heroin and crack cocaine, on to the grave. He died of a Valium overdose, after eight years clean, in August , dying in their mother’s house. “The paramedic came in and said: ‘He’s gone,’” Steven says. “I sat with him on the floor and cuddled him until they came and took him away.” Gone, but still loved still remembered.We are in the grip of a drugs deaths emergency here in Scotland, as everybody knows. Our drugs death rate is the worst in Europe. The toll for  was , – the highest it has ever been. It will come as little surprisethis year’s is higher still. The crosses are a reminder that each of the , was an inidual robbed of their future.En masse, they capture the scale of the problem. Spread out in rows like war graves, they say: “Here is a generation being wiped out, while those at the top play politics.” Is this too harsh  Maybe. Yet even as Steven placed his cross, the UK and Scottish governments were squabbling over rival drugs summits to be held in Glasgow a day apart. “My drugs summit is better than your drugs summit,” they blustered like children.Of course, politicians on both sides can justy their position. The UK government will say it announced its conference first. “But without consulting us, and without including those with lived experience,” the Scottish Government will counter. If either party does not understand how pathetic it sounds – how pathetic it is – for two governments who share responsibility for drugs policy to be unwilling to cut the crap and share a table, I suggest they get out of politics for a while and look at this from beyond the bubble. I suggest they spend some time in those communities where people are losing their lives for want of inter-agency collaboration and a coherent policy.This is not to suggest the Scottish Government is doing nothing. Last year – under pressure, and having previously cut frontline services – it set up the Drugs Deaths Task Force. In the recent budget it announced an extra £.m to be spent on “delivering innovative projects, testing new approaches and developing a national pathway for opiate substitute therapy”.The Scottish Government conference will also provide training in the use of Naloxone, which reverses the effect of drugs overdoses, and a demonstration model of a drugs consumption room. It insists what takes place there will “inform” its contribution to the UK summit the next day. And yet the mutual blame game neither side appears able to stop does not augur well.So often we hear about successful policy where, particularly in Portugal where drugs have been decriminalised, users have been de-stigmatised and those who consume can choose between harm reduction and rehab.But the key to Portugal’s success was not merely the approach itself, but the political consensus that formed around it and an unshakeable commitment to that approach through successive governments.Here in the UK, we are still treating drugs policy like a political football a forum for the airing of grievances a battleground for ideological dferences. This was happening long before the general election, but it is worse now the Tories have a thumping majority.The destructive relationship between Westminster and the Scottish Government – and more specically between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson – is spilling into other areas too, most notably the COP climate conference which will take place in Glasgow in November.This conference is supposed to build the coalition necessary to break the deadlock on international climate action – and therefore requires UK-wide co-operation and a gt for diplomacy.Already, however, it has been reduced to oneupmanship. Despite being advised otherwise, Johnson has refused to give Sturgeon any formal role in proceedings. And there have been disputes over the venue itself. With the conference set to be held in the Scottish Events Campus on the north of the river, the Scottish Government booked out the Science Centre on the south. But now the UK government says it needs both sites and has accused the Scottish Government of trying to undermine its plans. To make matters worse, the Prime Minister is said to have referred to Sturgeon as “that wee Jimmy Krankie woman” to which Sturgeon responded “ Boris Johnson wants to make personal insults against me, I’m a big enough girl to make personal insults back”. All highly constructive.I think most of us accept Johnson would try the patience of a saint. As last week’s reshuffle demonstrated, he – or rather Dominic Cummings – is hell-bent on exercising control. Claire Perry claims he sacked her as the president of the COP and replaced her with former international development secretary Alok Sharma because Whitehall couldn’t cope with an independent conference. Sharma is said to have a questionable record on environment issues.Given all this, it must be tempting to answer criticism by pointing out that “Johnson started this” and that he is a twat of the highest order. But that gets us nowhere. Meanwhile, the planet burns.Aware, presumably, that tit-for-tat fighting is destructive and childish, Sturgeon has called for a reset in relations. But for that to happen, the UK government will not only have to be willing to co-operate on key issues, the Scottish Government will have to stop constantly passing the buck southwards.The constitutional debate is not going to disappear. Both governments will be arguing over the legitimacy of a second independence referendum for some time. But they need to be able to set that argument aside when it comes to shared crises such as drugs deaths and climate change.Only by attempting to find common ground can progress be made. If that requires pride to be swallowed, and teeth to be gritted, then so be it. There are too many crosses already in Springburn too many species already extinct.

We must surely, he added, be witnessing a historical record – a government in crisis after just two months in power.Meanwhile, Labour-supporting commentators lined up to explain the replacement of Javid with, as one columnist described him, the “alarmingly obedient” Rishi Sunak.I’m bound to say that for a man mired in crisis, Johnson appears remarkably relaxed. When he and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, told Javid they wanted his team cleared out and replaced by a new staff of advisers working across both  and  Downing Street, they must have know there was a chance – a good one, at that – that the chancellor wouldn’t wear it. His decision to walk cannot have come as a shock.McDonnell’s description of a government in crisis is, I’m afraid, inaccurate. Rather, what we’re seeing is a Prime Minister fully in control. There is no crisis.In Javid’s eager beaver replacement, Johnson has precisely what he wanted: a compliant chancellor who will do what he desires.Quite why Sunak’s loyalty should be seen as “alarming”, I’m not sure. There is nothing in the rule book of politics that says the sign of a good chancellor is a willingness to defy the prime minister. Was Tony Blair’s Labour government improved by the fact chancellor Gordon Brown spent his every waking moment seething with resentment over his rival’s supremacy  No, it wasn’t, was it  In fact, briefing and counter-briefing by Number  and Treasury sources meant the fractured relationship between prime minister and chancellor frequently got in the way of smooth government. When both men would rather have seen their policy agenda make headlines, their bitter relationship became the focus of media attention.When, finally, Brown realised his ambition of becoming prime minister, he could not change his ways. A man born to plot, Brown soon began undermining his chancellor, Alistair Darling, destroying a professional and personal relationship that had endured for years.David Cameron and George Osborne entered government in  having learned from their predecessors. Relations between Downing Street and the Treasury were good for the first time in a long time.Cameron and Osborne were a team and they always understood the pecking order. Each got what he needed from the relationship.But Johnson has no such partner. The Prime Minister has no political soulmate.This being so, what, exactly is the problem with Johnson wishing to take a firm grip of the Treasury  It is, I think, the sort of thing that might look to voters like strong leadership. Few, I’d wager, now lament the passing of the Javid era.Among Johnson’s immediate priorities is solidying the Conservative vote in areas of England which once ed Labour MPs. The Prime Minister will want to deliver for areas in the Midlands and the North of England which went Tory for the first time in generations. If he does not make good on his promises of regeneration and investment then the PM risks watching those voters drt back to Labour.What Johnson needs, right now, is a chancellor who is completely on board with this agenda. But there is something  beyond the Prime Minister’s desire for a compliant chancellor at play, here. Johnson has just sent a message to every member of his parliamentary party that the rules of the game have changed. His demand is complete loyalty, nothing less.From what McDonnell describes as a crisis will, I think, spring a period of uncommon stability in government. Last year, Johnson won the parliamentary majority he craved. Now, he has stamped his authority on his party in no uncertain terms.This same message came across loudly and clearly in Johnson’s dismissal from his cabinet of former leadership contenders Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey. Leadsom is a popular figure among members of the Tory Party’s Eurosceptic right wing. Johnson’s calculation is that he need not concern himself with the feelings of those members. Javid comes out of the last few days rather well, I think. No chancellor can complain about a demand for loyalty but the order to dismiss his team of advisers was a step too far, one provocation too many.That Javid said no to this suggests he has something about him, after all.In a statement following his resignation, the former chancellor reiterated his support for Johnson. I wonder how long this will last.It is undoubtedly the case that when political parties lose discipline, they lose elections. Look at the SNP. For decades, they did nothing but tear each other apart over the best way in which independence might be achieved. Bitter recrimination was part and parcel of SNP membership. And then Alex Salmond ed as party leader for a second stint and he laid down the bloody law to his colleagues. There was to be no briefing about colleagues, no criticism of government policy, and no public disagreement over any of the party’s positions.What followed was as period of unity in the SNP ranks that continues – the occasional domestic disturbance, aside – to this day.I’m not sure Johnson is behaving especially dferently to the way Salmond did. Doubtless, opposition parties will taunt Chancellor Rishi Sunak when he next rises to speak in the House of Commons. They will leave him in no doubt that they consider him a poodle.But each and every one of Boris Johnson’s opponents will privately admire the way he strengthened his grip on the Tory Party last week.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

After a spirited campaign by his opponent Michelle Ballantyne, Carlaw in the end won comfortably with a % to % share of the members’ votes cast. The party should be thankful to Ballantyne for ensuring there was a contest, not least for allowing Carlaw to now say with authority he has an unequivocal mandate to run the party. She also gave voice to concerns that have been building up over recent years about party management. Carlaw will surely want to address these rather than exacerbate them. While the candidates did their best to present themselves as dferent and thus offer a genuine choice, the reality is they had far more in common than what ided them. For the party this is a good thing as members now have to unite behind Carlaw’s leadership and turn their attention to the most important challenge facing them – defeating the SNP in the  elections.Their first goal will be to prevent the SNP having an overall majority like that won by Alex Salmond in , but then lost by Nicola Sturgeon in . Despite the appalling performance of our public services under the management of the SNP government, recent polling suggests it could yet win such a huge mandate. While possible I think it unlikely, for once the electorate begins to consider the SNP’s record in detail its failure must begin to pay idends for the opposition. Also fundamental to the debate is how the dominance of Brexit will recede, allowing more oxygen to be given to the scrutinising the performance of SNP ministers.The second goal must then be to lay the ground for a new administration that locks the SNP out of government evenSturgeon wins the most seats. An alternative minority administration that enjoys a comfort and supply arrangement would be the most likely route – as neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats will want to even hint at a coalition, never mind formalise one. In an effort to kill-off such a prospect the SNP will seek to demonise any party offering to work with dreaded Tories – or “Tory Scum” as the infamous banner that graces nationalist marches brands over half a million Scottish voters. In response the argument has to be put that it was the Tories who provided a comfort and supply arrangement to Salmond and Sturgeon between -. If the Tories were good enough for the SNP then, why should it not be good enough for Carlaw to do the same with other partiesit’s best for the for the country It is impossible to say what role the Labour Party will play in all of these developments too much depends on how its UK leadership election works out, but there are other encouraging signs that offer hope to unionists. Yesterday Scottish Business UK, the pro-Union business group backed by hundreds of Scottish businesses and including many household names, published a new paper advocating a more positive and assertive approach by the UK government. Included in the paper Strengthening the Union: A Framework for Business Success were proposals for a UK Department of the Union which would have grant-aiding powers to assist directly initiatives that will help the UK’s cohesiveness. These might be community based or infrastructure projects – but they would clearly demonstrate and say on the tin they have been delivered by the UK.Other ideas included an Office for Budget Responsibility for the Union that would bring more transparency to encourage both accountability and value for money in public spending. Interestingly it is argued the new OBR could become a force for helping achieve UK-wide spending commitments in Scotland as well challenging them. The paper also considered issues from taxation to fisheries, cultural exchange within the UKto migration. Some may fly, others probably will not, but the fact that a business group is bringing forward positive ideas that can add value to being in the UK illustrates how the UK’s status quo is never set in stone.Indeedthere is one dference why the UK’s advocates won the independence referendum of  but the Europhiles lost that of  is the UK is evolving and decentralising by devolving power out to nations and cities – whereas the EU is taking more and more power for itself. Other unionist organisations are also stirring Scotland in Union, the largest campaign group defending the Union launched a Valentine video message last week and another offering ten reasons Scotland is stronger in the UK. That might not seem especially unusualbut the adoption of a positive rather than negative tone represents a change in approach away from the project fear of the past and, I believe, will begin to pay idends. Likewise the meetings being organised around the country by the unionist lobbying group Scotland Matters demonstrates the level of activism outside party circles is growing. True, such events are not at the levels of Yes activism, but that’s not the appropriate comparison, the point is no such activities were even being considered by unionists before the last referendum in . This time Unionists of all parties or none are mobilising in advance of the  elections to head off nationalism before any referendum.Later this weekend in Newcastle-upon-Tyne the discussion forum “These Islands” holds a two day conference to explores issues of culture and identity that are rarely given enough thought by unionists.The growth of such activities points to a more confident and less complacent approach from unionists be they large or small “U”. It shows a willingness to do grown-up politics, to have adult and reasoned debate away from the obscenities and hatred spouted at marches, worn on T-shirts and sprayed across social media that too many nationalists have descended into.All of Scotland’s pro-British parties can tap into this new wave of unionist optimism – and then maybe learn to work together.Brian Monteith is editor of ThinkScotland.org©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch the snp is no cult mr carlaw the tories however","story":"It is not wise for the new Scots Tory leader to bait half the electorate, writes Lesley Riddoch.‘I understand the SNP. It’s not really a political party, it’s an evangelical faith-based cult. It believes entirely in independence and almost nothing .’\u2028We all know Jackson Carlaw doesn’t think much of the SNP or Nicola Sturgeon, but perhaps it’s a surprise to discover he thinks so little of their supporters. Was it entirely wise to bait such a large group of voters in his very first BBC interview as Scottish Conservative leader  : Brian Monteith: Are Scottish unionists beginning to get their act together After all, this “evangelical faith-based cult” has an awful lot of members. So many as to defy definition as “a religious group, often living together, whose beliefs are considered extreme or strange by many people.” Doesn’t support by roughly half the electorate suggest a shared outlook that’s too mainstream to qualy as “extreme and strange”  A smaller party with just  per cent of the vote, has stronger cultish potential. There’s one problem for the Scottish Tories though. They’re missing the number one cult prerequisite - a charismatic leader. Or at least one who thinks before he lets rip.Just three hours before Mr Carlaw was lambasting half the Scottish electorate for its zombie-like adherence to the cult of independence, his boss was in London, surrounded by cabinet members, visibly shaking with nerves to be in the very presence of the Great Tousled One. Whatthey had a senior moment and shouted the wrong hospital total whatthey couldn’t remember the Boris bus plan whatthe tension in the room got so bad, they found themslves blurting out the terrible words, Sajid Javid  So, which party behaved most like a cult, last week  Let’s see.Worship of one man - check.Willingness to be subject to total control - check.Jumpiness beside the Holy One - check.Inability to point out the Emperor is wearing no clothes - check.Enthusiastic advocacy of leadership plans that are patent nonsense- check.Only one set of people exhibited slavish, unquestioning and fearful worship of their leader last week - and it wasn’t the SNP.Much has been said about the Stepford Wives-like atmosphere in the Cabinet Room of  Downing Street, as highly-paid, grown adults were made to chant targets and repeat makey-uppey Tory achievements, right on cue. The whole spectacle was pathetic. The fact Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings saw fit to approve it for broadcast was nothing short of scary. This is how democracy works in the Mother of Cabinets now - dae whit yer telt, or sling yer hook.Given this extraordinary backdrop to Jackson Carlaw’s “cultish” remarks, the main online reponse was humour. Within an hour the hashtag #SNPCommandments was trending in Scotland, with dozens of contributions to the list of “rules” for SNP cult membership “Thou shalt say how, when thy meanest - why. Unless thy granny is present thy maw shall always be correct. Thou shalt take thine coat aff indoors or thou shalt not get the use of it later. Thou shalt always yell “do you think this is the Blackpool illuminations” when there’s more than one light on in the house.” And my personal favourite Blessed are the doofer holders, for they shall change the channels.Yes, it’s silly. And ingenious. And light-hearted, and fun.Jackson Carlaw, should be thanked for a statement so patently daft, that it simply inspired “cult members” to revel in the quirks of the Mither Tongue and archetypal Scot instead of getting annoyed. With Brexit, Storm Dennis and the coronavirus hogging the headlines, the gt of levity - even un-intentional - is a marvellous thing.But the biggest problem with Jackson Carlaw’s cult theory is that slavish adherence to one person hardly fits the character of supposed members.They are Scots after all.And serious, earnest old besoms that we are, Scots don’t really do fandom. We generally value issues over iniduals, policy over people and long-term strategy over short-term tactics. Voters south of the border seem unaccountably willing to play the serf to Boris Johnson’s reincarnated Good King Hal. Good luck to them. The more he lords it around, followed by his very own Dominic Cromwell, the more folk with a desperate need to believe in feudal authority, hierarchy and the Good Old Days seem to like it.Look - there’s Boris, getting things done, showing his cabinet who is boss, standing up for Britain etc etc. The act must be working south of the border or focus groups would have stopped transmission of that bizarre cabinet meeting dead in its tracks. But the strong-man act isn’t working in Scotland. There’s no Boris bounce here, just as there was no Cameron surge or May bob.The cut of inidual jibs matters far less to Scottish voters than the policies backed by each party and Prime Minister.As the th anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath approaches, let’s get this right. The bulk of Scots today are fairly similar to the noble signatories of yesteryear - wary of o’er powerful leaders and ready to risk antagonism by lending them only conditional support. Of course, there is faith and belief underpinning the cause of independence. But it’s a belief in the sovereignty of the Scottish people, not slavish support for one inidual leader.Some Yes supporters do have unrealistic hopes for independence -but that’s not the majority. Most realise problems won’t disappear overnight when Scotland becomes independent, but will be tackled dferently by folk who live here and share a common cultural and political outlook. Maybe this is why Jackson Carlaw is playing the woman - and the supporters - not the message, because it is pretty attractive.Why shouldn’t the people of Scotland run Scotland - could they do any worse on the big reserved issues than zombie-like cabinet members of Tory England  Or maybe Jackson’s cult salvo was a Boris-like attempt to deflect attention from other problems Sunday papers report that some senior Scottish Conservatives now back a second independence referendum, because a powerful and threatening SNP must loom large, to help the issue-free Scottish Tories activate their unionist support. Clearly, these Tory eminent grises don’t believe the “unrelatable” Jackson Carlaw can do the job himself.Ironic, for a man obsessed with the personality of the SNP leader and her loyal but not uncritical grassroots support. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon public support for scottish independence at tipping point","story":"The SNP leader has predicted an \"acceleration\" in the sht towards independence seen in recent polls as she stepped up her demands for a second vote on leaving the UK in response to Brexit.The Scottish Parliament recently backed a motion, pushed through by the SNP-Greens majority, which endorsed a second referendum.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"council apologise after grave mistake","story":"BELFAST City Council has had to apologise to a recently bereaved family after ly informing them that a stranger was buried in their loved one’s grave.Last week, Council officials told the West Belfast family they could not bury their relative alongside her mother as there was an additional person interred in the burial plot.A grieving family member spoke of her family’s trauma when, as they prepared for her sister-in-law’s funeral last week, Belfast City Council insisted that another woman had been buried in the grave since .“My brother was insistent that this was a new plot, only opened in  when his mother-in-law died but the ‘spokesperson’ in City Hall was also insistent that they were right and their records are never wrong,” she explained.“After nearly an hour of stress and annoyance my brother had a brainwave that the new plot his mother-in-law was in didn’t exist in .“The graves at the new plots at the very top of City Cemetery didn’t date back that far.”Following an investigation it was revealed that Belfast City Council had mistaken the family grave for another after mixing up the plots.“My poor, grieving brother who had lost his we just hours before was left totally wrung out and traumatised – I was the same,” the bereaved woman said.“No apology from City Hall whatsoever just a bit of a ‘d’oh’ moment and ‘oh human error’ – not good enough!“Whoever is inputting these statistics and grave co-ordinates needs to be checked and rechecked to make sure this type of incident doesn’t happen again.“City Hall need to remember they are dealing with bereaved people and desperately need to show a bit more compassion when dealing with these types of things.”The woman accused Belfast City Council of passing “the buck on to the ordinary, bereaved families”.“The administrative side of Belfast City Hall reeks of laziness, incompetency and pure lack of compassion and I expect some sort of reply”.This is the second time Belfast City Council has had to apologise to a bereaved family in as many weeks.Last week, the Andersonstown News reported how council officials apologised after sending a letter to a deceased woman asking her to repair her own headstone.Commenting on its latest blunder, a Belfast City Councilspokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for any distress caused to the family. When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

The current penalty is half that imposed where in the UK.Last year a government survey found that more than half of drivers here have admitted using a mobile while at the wheel.According to new PSNI statistics, obtained by the Belfast , a total of , offences were recorded in the three years to last April -  a day on average.The youngest caught was just , even though the legal age to drive is .

Anyone who uses a mobile phone whilst driving is putting themselves and others at risk, which is why police remain committed to addressing this dangerous activity.Absolutely nothing on your mobile device or social media accounts should come before your safety and the safety of others.Police will continue to focus on robustly enforcing the law to make our roads safer.What the law actually statesThe law says it is illegal to drive a vehicle or ride a motorbike while using a hand-held mobile phone or a similar device like a BlackBerry. It is also illegal to use a hand-held phone when supervising a learner driver or rider.Drivers also risk prosecution for not having proper control of a vehicle when using a hands-free phone.Hand-held devices should not be used when stopped at traffic lights or queuing in traffic.An employer can be prosecutedthey ask employees to make or receive calls while driving.Those caught using a hand-held mobile phone or similar device while driving or riding will get an automatic fixed penalty notice of three penalty points and a fine of £.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most Read#Miracle no one was hurt# as Storm Dennis damages Dundonald shopsLarne church targeted in #sectarian hate crime#Tributes to Arnie Clarke who drowned in desperate bid to save dog in Co Down riverDramatic scenes as man rescued from Belfast HarbourChildren present when man shot in #savage# attack in Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many of the pupils at Ballougry PS have a family link to the school and children come from as far afield as Eglinton and Donemana to be educated there.We have children whose parents, grandparents and even great grandparents have been at the school.The parents have such fond memories of their time here that they want their children to enjoy the same type of education, no matter where they are living.Mr OKane believes that attending a small primary school equips children well for the transition to secondary school.In a small school setting you have to get on well with everyone and the children thrive on it.In bigger schools you can jump around friendship groupsthings arent working out, but here you just have to work it out.We were very happy with out recent transfer test results and our children will be moving on to every post primary school in the city.”Mr OKane concluded: The feedback that we always get is that the children really do represent us well.Among the schools best known past pupils is renowned actress, Amanda Burton, well known for her television roles, including Heather Black in the Channel  soap opera Brookside, Beth Glover in Peak Practice, Sam Ryan in the BBC crime drama series Silent Witness, Clare Blake in The Commander and Karen Fisher in Waterloo Road.Her father was a headmaster at the school. googletag.cmd.push Photos: Tom Heaney   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an ‘Embrace the Giant Spirit’ event organised by Tourism NI, actors Stephen Rea, Tara Lynne O’Neill and Laurence Kinlan, musician Neil Martin and the singer-songwriter Lisa Hannigan, gave a unique and moving performance to celebrate Seamus Heaney’s work at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin.The programme was curated by Seamus Heaney HomePlace, the literary centre in Bellaghy, Co Derry, which takes visitors on a journey through the le and literature of the poet, with an invited audience including members of the Heaney family, representatives from the local tourism industry as well as arts, culture and media.The performers came together as part of an initiative which aims to highlight the literary connections between Seamus Heaney HomePlace, which recently reached its , visitor milestone, and the hugely successful ‘Listen Now Again’ exhibition, which draws on the National Library’s extensive Heaney archive and has welcomed over , visitors since it opened in Dublin in July .Featuring powerful performances of Seamus Heaney’s work, including an adaptation in words and music of an excerpt of Aeneid: Book VI and a haunting performance of Anahorish by Lisa Hannigan, the event comes as HomePlace prepares to extend its visitor experience into the landscape which so inspired the poet and which features in his work.A total of  locations of signicance to Seamus Heaney are being developed, notable among them being Lough Beg a place of ‘special memories’ for the poet where a boardwalk will lead visitors to a newly constructed viewing point to see Church Island and its famous spire, with extracts of poetry audible, as well as visible along the route. A riverside walk by the Moyola River is also being created and a newly commissioned sculpture will form the focal point for visitors to hear and read poetry at the eel fishery in Toome. Visitors will also be able to download an app, which will allow access to augmented reality as they journey through each location.Fiona Cunningham, RoI Market Manager for Tourism NI said, “With the impressive Seamus Heaney HomePlace, situated in Bellaghy, only two and a half hours from Dublin, visitors can really immerse themselves in our greatest poet’s writing and discover many areas of his beloved hometown that inspired so much of his work.“Over , thousand have visited the Dublin exhibition since it opened in , and many may be unaware of the very unique and spiritually moving experience one can also get when visiting Heaney HomePlace. Visitors are coming from all over the world to soak up the beautul place, people and landscapes in Northern Ireland that inspired him so much and we want to encourage people from across Ireland to make the unforgettable trip to follow his journey, walk the paths he took and explore through his words at Seamus Heaney HomePlace.

There is a momentum building across Ireland and an opportunity for us to create a cultural tourism network across the entire landscape, North to South, East to West, where we and our visitors can embrace a ‘giant literary spirit’”.Brian McCormick, manager of HomePlace said: “We want to extend our sincere thanks to Tourism NI for hosting such a special evening and for continuing to highlight the incredible opportunities there are, through HomePlace and Listen Now Again, for visitors to engage with and be inspired by Seamus Heaney and his work”.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

This year, there’s an incredible line-up for you to celebrate International Womens Day - on the bill there’sThe Henry Girls, Blackbird  Crow, Reevah,Blood,Great White Lies andTara Giwith comperes for the evening Madonna Kebab and Thran Leeann, with the night ening with some tunes fromThe Stray Kitten.All that for pound in Sandino’s on Saturday, March .But, before that, on Saturday next, February , in the Gasyard, Blood’s Noella Hutton will be launching her new album.Noella doesn’t need an introduction, but for those of you who have never been outside she has had some of the best adventures of any of Derry’s musicians. “My first experiences of live music were of my sister, Jeanette, singing around the house,” she says, being inspired herself to moving to London to pursue her career, like many other musicians from Derry.She was signed to music superpower Universal Records in the late s, went to America, recorded her first album in the Record Plant in Sausalito, Calornia, where Rumours by Fleetwood Mac was made and took to the daily grind of constant gigging of being a working musician. Her follow-up album was made in Santa Monica and she came back to Derry in . She has consistently been writing and she promises anewalbum isn’t too far away. Really, really close actually. Solo album number three, is out on the nd.Have ye totally abandoned Jeanette or what’s the craic  googletag.cmd.push “I hate her phahahaha, naw, we still do the odd Blood gig. Theres just nowhere interested in doing original gigs. BennIgans is probably the only place that does. Wherever my album takes me Blood will go too. Jeanette is my best friend, my big sister, my greatest influence in every way, and we havethe same dark sense of humour. phahahaha very important!”Following your Facebook page, is there anyone you haven’t met  “To me, these people were powerful from a distance. Get them up close and sit with them theyre all just ordinary and winging it like the rest of us. Some of the loveliest folk I met where Sarah McLaughlin and Boy George. Theres a few more and a few that were very disappointing. Ill leave the details for another time.” googletag.cmd.push Tell us about recording the album… “Ive known Justin Black for  yearss. Hes been one of the only people besides ourJeanette that really cared and pushed me out of my depression.He has been annoying me for years to do an album for me. I can safely say hes one of the most talented,selfless... annoying... and extremely loyal friends Ive ever had. We have much to do.”This would be the time and place to mention that there won’t be a physical version of the album. If you were born before Nirvana that means there won’t be any vinyl or CDs, in fact Noella has said she hates Cds… me too. These are the times we live in and we might as well get used to it. I’m all for Noella’s approach. Are ye nervous putting it out by yourself  “I wouldnt want it any other way.Record companies are saturated with artists.Theyre just big banks who make most of the money so I would rather tread slowly and just enjoy the whole process and journey with the folk I trust to help me.” It’s a dferent music world from the s, how’d ye adapt “Its a great time to be a singer-songwriter recording our own songs. The internet has opened up immense possibilities. It’s very hard work. But having the right tools and in the hands of the best people anything is possible!”.Fascinating secret fact revealed…. Jeanette and NoellaHuttonsang in choirs and competed in feiseanna and have been named as an inspiration by most musicians I chat to.Another fascinating fact is that Noella is George Hutton’s big cousin and he has said “Noella and Jeanette are my cousins, but they’ve been a big inspiration of mine growing up. Two fearless performers with two beautul raw and passionate voices, writing songs from their very core, I absolutely love them.”Keep up to date here, www.facebook thefirstnoellaand get the album “Love  Liars” releasedon Saturday from Noella’s band page throughBandcamp.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Local council officials say that they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site.They hope that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what residents and traders would like to see and what would work at this particular site.The development brief for the town centre location is expected to outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon has welcomed confirmation that a so-called soft market testing exercise is to proceed shortly.ldquoThis will allow potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to visit the Irish Street site during a planned open day. This will allow them to give their views on the potential of the site and point out any likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe feedback provided will be used to assist the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to prepare a development brief for the site.ldquoThe regeneration project for the former police base site provides an opportunity to regenerate Downpatrick town centre. We are looking at the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre location and build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 Down Cathedral.jpg","title":"Down Cathedral receives recognition for tourism  ","story":"DOWN Cathedral in Downpatrick has been officially recognised for giving visitors a warm welcome.The Welcome Ministry of Down Cathedral received special recognition from CIE Tours International at a recent awards ceremony in Dublin.The awards were based on feedback from over , CIE customers surveyed throughout the year.Dean Henry Hull and cathedral administrator Sharon McVeigh collected the award at a ceremony at Dublinrsquos Christ Church Cathedral last month.Down Cathedral was one of only seven locations in Ulster to receive a merit award, along with Hillsborough Castle and the Giantrsquos Causeway.Dean Hull explained that welcome is at the heart of our ministry in Down Cathedral.ldquoOver , people visit the cathedral each year.

He hopes, however, that he has allayed their immediate fears by stressing that he would not tolerate bad behaviour on his premises. He was willing to give a lead to stop it.He made the point to objectors that the ldquosinister element was already in the town and he did not want trouble any more than other shopkeepers or residents who had suffered at the hands of vandals.DOWNPATRICK mdash A young Downpatrick pop group has made a spectacular comeback on the local music trail after a two-year layoff.The former Sunbeams, now calling themselves Memphis, have been travelling up and down the country fulfilling engagements in halls, clubs and hotels.Ironically it was transport problems which forced them off the road in  but they have since been organising their comeback and are now better equipped and more experienced.Their repertoire is packed with the latest sounds and such is their wide selection of numbers that they played non-stop at alast month for five and a half hours.The group is fronted by the delectable and talented Janet Wilcox who is joined by her brother Stewart , Patrick McAuley , Danny Skeffingtonand Philip Hynds .Up to now most of their engagements have ben south of the border but they are now ready to make their mark up north, particularly around Co Down.BALLYKINLAR mdash Portaferry Dramatic Society will present the play lsquoIs the Priest at Homersquo  in the Parochial Hall, Ballykinlar, tomorrow night at pm.Written by the internationally famed Joseph Tomelty, himself a former resident of the town, the play is set in a priestrsquos home in a small in Northern Ireland during the early s.It is currently enjoying a very successful run in parochial and community halls throughout the Ards and Lecale peninsula, and indeed, in response to public demandperformances are being planned at some venues.Two of the playwrightrsquos brothers are members of the society, with Jim Tomelty playing the leading role of the curate.

But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs. She said this not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town.Cllr Mason said that housing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site.She added: ldquoThe bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road. The new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that Ms Mallon will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.He said: ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch, but the wider South Down area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 New Queens.jpg","title":"New queens of Ulster  ","story":"ST Maryrsquos High School, Downpatrick, lted the prestigious Erne Cup for the first time at the Mid Ulster Sports Arena, Cookstown, last Wednesday afternoon with a blistering display of attacking football.Victory was no more than the local girls deserved when they gained revenge for last seasonrsquos heartbreaking cup final defeat to the same opposition.St Maryrsquos started the game strongly and turned their possession into scores with an early goal from Saulrsquos Cara Doran settling the nerves.The Enniskillen girls were simply not allowed to play their vaunted expansive game and Katie Convie raced in almost immediately to make it - to - when she capitalised on a poor kick-out.St Fanchearsquos had no intention of giving up their title without a fight and replied with three consecutive points. However, a buoyant St Maryrsquos outfit replied with points from Cora Convery, Alishia Lundy and Shannon Sloan to maintain their six-point lead.Six points quickly became  by the half-time break as St Maryrsquos continued to terrorise St Fanchearsquos and scores from Doran , Abi Murphyand the lethal Shannon Sloangave the locals a commanding - to - lead.St Franchearsquos came out fighting in the second half, scoring a goal and two points without reply to reduce the arrears to  point, but that was as good as it got as St Maryrsquos quickly regained the initiative and went for broke.They certainly put the foot on the gas and points from Erin Sands, Katie Convie and Cara Doran had St Maryrsquos well clear St Fanchearsquos kept on to the bitter end and forced a great save form St Marys goalkeeper Fia McFaul as they tried to get back into contention.However, McFaul and her defensive wall of Keely OrsquoNeill, player of the match Nora Maguire, team captain Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy and Lucy Morgan kept St Fanchearsquos at bay.At midfield, Eimear Teggart and Erin Sands dominated throughout the game and kept their dazzling forward busy with a constant supply of good ball.Abi Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convery, Shannon Sloan and Katie Convie were literally unplayable and gave the St Fanchearsquos defence a torrid time all afternoon.St Maryrsquos: Fia McFaul, Keely OrsquoNeill, Nora Maguire, Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy, Lucy Morgan, Eimear Teggart, Erin Sands, Abie Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convie, Shannon Sloan, Katie Convie.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl to develop a new store and dedicated base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Councillors are keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure that Newcastle boasts an ultra-modern community and leisure facility.They say that the provision of a new centre for residents and visitors is long overdue and that a resort the size of Newcastle should and must have adequate leisure provision. Some councillors are keen to see a family fun pool in the proposed new-build.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed that several feasibility studies and strategic reports have been compiled in relation to the Newcastle Centre.She also confirmed that a recent review of the feasibility studies and their findings has been completed and is being considered by the local authority.ldquoUntil further scoping works are carried out, the council cannot confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or the Tropicana, said the spokeswoman.She added: ldquoHowever, encroaching on to the promenade is not anticipated.

The clear message from voters of all parties was that our Province could not continue to drt after three years without local decisions on everyday issues like our roads, schools and hospitals.By Arlene Foster, First MinisterSaturday, th February , : am\"\"Arlene FosterAlthough the New Decade New Approach deal is not perfect it was fair and balanced. We should take the elements about respecting each other’s identity and use it as the vehicle for promoting a vibrant and prosperous Northern Ireland, as an active and integral and part of the UK, as we approach the centenary of the place we are proud to call home.Those pretending that the political vacuum of the last three years was in Unionism’s best interests offer only a short-sighted strategy. That is not the position of the DUP. The reality is that people living in every part of Northern Ireland whatever their political outlook, want delivery of effective frontline services, not the ision of a border poll or distraction of recycling the Brexit debate. Despite some of the spin, the  RTE exit poll showed almost one in five of SF voters didn’t even support a border poll. Instead % prioritised healthcare.We should not be complacent in defending and promoting the overwhelming benefits of being part of the UK. However we should not lose sight of the fact that the best defence against those who wish to take us out of the UK is to create a socially thriving and economically prosperous Northern Ireland. A Northern Ireland where everyone feels at home and where everywhere has a genuine and active stake in determining their future. Despite its accepted weaknesses and frustrations, devolution is still the key to this. Yesterday I attended a business breakfast in the Castlereagh Hills. There I presented my vision of making our Province a better place to live, work, grow up, raise a family and do business. That means building a dynamic and successful regional economy. Protecting first and foremost unfettered access for trade with Great Britain, in both directions, and ensuring local interests are met in the implementation of Brexit. It means pursuing better infrastructure connections both with Great Britain and between dferent hubs of jobs and growth within Northern Ireland. This will increase the number of households seeing practical benefits of living their lives within the fth largest global economy.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It is not in the wider interests of unionism to allow the brain drain to continue. We are committed to working with domestic and international businesses to identy skills gaps and create better links between education routes at all levels and the needs of employers not just tomorrow but in five or ten years’ time. All the while ensuring affected sectors like agri-food and hospitality have access to the outside labour they need in the short-term. At the same time we have to showcase Northern Ireland, building on the strong tourism brand already established. Earlier this week the Tourism NI’s Visitor Attitude Survey reported that % of visitors to Causeway Coast and Glens thought it met or exceeded expectations. The future for Northern Ireland as a positive brand is bright. The possibilities are limitless and we will work proactively with the newly appointed Cabinet Minister for the Constitution and Devolution to make even further strides.Last year the DUP began work on developing a “Next Generation Unionism” approach. This work continues and we must seek to be pro-active in developing our case rather and building the broadest possible support. I am clear that restoring Stormont isn’t a barrier to a vibrant and forward-looking brand of Unionism. It presents a fresh impetus that we must be ambitious to exploit. The road will not always be easy. There will be challenges. However this is how we will protect the interests of unionism and secure Northern Ireland’s place for the next  years. We all have a role to play in this process and I look forward to getting started.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.A Linfield shirt from  “The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Askedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleRyan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”At the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.The interior of the shop in Smithfield market“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do. Now we’re speaking to clubs on the phone.“Obviously George Best put Northern Ireland on the map but recently with us doing well in the Euros people are paying attention outside of here.”While the online shop is rising in prominence the lads are trying to spread the word that they have a physical shop in Smithfield as well. “So many people come in to the shop and say they didn’t know we were here,” said Ryan. “Now they’re coming once a month to see what new things we’ve got in.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

He said: \"The Historical Environments Division is a section of the Department for Communities whose responsibility is to protect historical sites in Northern Ireland and therefore safeguard our heritage.In respect to Knock Iveagh on the outskirts of Rathfriland - a prehistoric burial site date back to  years BC and the site where the inauguration of medieval Irish Kings took place - the HED has failed and they have failed miserably. In fact had it not been for the ‘Friends of Knock Iveagh’, a public interest group, this Neolithic site would have destroyed by development that should never have been allowed.\"Having asked written questions of both the Ministers for the Communities and Infrastructure it is clear that their failing from  has led us to a situation where they have now passed the issue onto Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough council planners.\"This has put the local government planners in a dficult position. If they were to apply enforcement orders on the developers on Knock Iveagh, the ones that were given permission to develop by the Department for Infrastructure and were not stopped by the Department for the Communities, then there may be a massive compensation or legal cost for such action and that will be passed to the rate payers of the local council area. \"How can it be fair that the rate payers of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon could pick up the cost of the failings by DfC and DfI.\"It is time that both DfI and DfC - who have the powers to put Knock Iveagh back to the way it was before they mistakenly gave authority for a wind turbine development - to step up and take the financial responsibility for their mistakes. The government sponsored vandalism of a site scheduled for protection under the Historical and Archaeological Objects Order is a disgrace but allowing local council to pick up the cost compounds the damage started in  and should not be acceptable.\"A Department for Infrastructurespokesman said: “Councils are responsible for the proper administration and lawful processing of their own planning and or enforcement cases. The Department recognises the concerns and strength of feeling but, under the Transition Provisions for the transfer of the majority of planning s to the new Councils in April , responsibility for planning application permission does now lie with the Council. “The planning and enforcement issues in what is a highly complex case are also a matter for the Council. “A spokesperson for ABC Council said: “The Council is currently considering a number of Planning matters in relation to the site at Knockiveagh including requests to revoke discontinue planning permission for the wind turbine.“All of these planning matters remain under consideration at the present time,” said the spokesperson.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_2743935.jpg--.jpg?1581604995000\\","title":"no one located after multi agency search of strule river ","story":"Police received a report of a concern for safety in the Drumragh Avenue area of Omagh in the early hours of this morning .

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
