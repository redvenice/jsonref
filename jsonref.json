Interview by Felix PettyMy first game at White Hart Lane was Tottenham v Wimbledon on Saturday 10 November 1990. We won the game 4–2. I sat in Park Lane watching a Spurs side featuring Gazza, Lineker, Mabbutt, Walsh … But my love for Tottenham started long before that. We all have our stories as to why we support the club. Mine might be a little different to most, having grown up in Denmark.The first ever game I remember watching on TV was the 1978 World Cup final between Argentina and Holland. I was six years old and watched the game with my parents. I remember taking an instant liking to the Argentina kits, the blue and white stripes and the black shorts. I was blown away by the atmosphere and celebrations and instantly fell in love with football. After that summer I started following the English games on TV and as the recent World Cup winners Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa had signed for Spurs, I decided Tottenham was going to be my team. I watched as many games as I could on TV before I finally moved to London in 1993 and was from then on finally able to visit White Hart Lane on a regular basis.I’ve been supporting Tottenham most of my life and seen us in good and bad times. Seen players and managers come and go, and it can be frustrating, even heartbreaking, when they leave for another team. Sometimes it can feel like there’s little loyalty in football. One day you are Spurs, the next day you can go play for a rival. The focus is always on the players and the manager. I was interested in making a project about the fans. The fans never switch allegiances, they are here forever and I felt that needed to be documented and celebrated.I started bringing my camera to the games and photographed the atmosphere on the streets and in the pubs before and after. It ended up growing into an obsession, and after three years I realised that I was beginning to document a piece of our history – the last seasons at White Hart Lane. I decided that our last game at White Hart Lane should be the endpoint of this project. I went to, and photographed, over 100 home and away games between 2013 and 2017.I wanted to capture different generations of fans, the camaraderie, the banter, the songs in the pubs, the madness. Travelling up and down the country and the long away trips in Europe. I wasn’t interested in making a chronological “football fan” book covering all the games with numerous pictures on each page. I wanted the book to have some artistic merit in terms of photography. I am interested in people and I’ve always been more interested in photography that is open-ended, pictures that are suggestive and open to interpretation, rather than pictures that are descriptive.The Arsenal derbies are always memorable, something every fan looks forward to. It’s an early start and you can feel the tension and excitement in the atmosphere all over north London. I also used to love the trips to Upton Park, which are now sadly also part of history. The European away trips are fantastic. There is something special about going abroad with Tottenham. Being in a different country, putting our flags and banners up and taking over a pub with all the familiar faces. The last game at White Hart Lane was emotional and beautiful. When we beat Manchester City away in 2016, when Eriksen scored the winner in the 83rd minute, and of course our 3-1 win against Real Madrid at Wembley, these were all very special moments.There’s something about going to all those games, travelling home and away, which forms bonds between people, and over the past five years I have met so many fantastic characters and heard many Tottenham stories. There is something fascinating about meeting and talking to lifelong fans, those who have been there since the glory days – there’s a real link to the history of the club in their memories. It’s important to memorialise that.I was interested in capturing characters, emotions and expressions and also the dynamics of the group. I kept an instinctive approach throughout and often shot from the hip. Nothing was planned or staged. It was all about capturing those little moments – a feeling that could so often get lost if I’d spent time framing the shots.It definitely helped being a Spurs boy, but you don’t just turn up and get invited in and start taking pictures. In the beginning there were certainly a few people who questioned what I was doing pointing a camera in their face. I knew from the beginning that I had to take my time. It was important for me to get to know people first, find out what they are doing and just go with the flow. It might sound like a cliché, but you can’t make images happen when you want them to – the images will come to you. It’s a little bit like fishing – sometimes you catch something and sometimes you come home empty-handed.I like using my camera as a tool to meet other people. It can help break down boundaries. I always treat everyone with respect – if they didn’t want to be photographed I wouldn’t photograph them. I am always modest and interested in what other people are doing and thinking.

The gentleman in the foreground, Joe Wrenn, organises this group ride every fall in the hilly terrain to the north of the Mississippi delta. I’ve been going for a few years.Trail rides are universal in the American cowboy tradition. In other states you might find thousands of people on a single ride. Here there were about 100 people, many riding, and others, who you can’t see in the photo, on dirt bikes and all-terrain vehicles.Most of the delta region is completely flat. Up here, though, are rolling hills, which is where the group gets its name. The ride wasn’t following a trail – part of it was along an old logging road. We had all stopped for a break. People were relaxing, playing music and then, when we started back out, Joe drove the truck up alongside these three horses. I shot I don’t know how many frames. I remember feeling so excited at getting both Joe and the kids on their horses silhouetted against that beautiful, late-afternoon sun bursting through. That is Joe’s grandson on the first horse.Elsewhere, I have photographed a great-grandmother who had just turned 92 – her husband, now deceased, was one of the first cowboys to start organising these rides in the delta. And I’ve photographed little kids, maybe four or five, riding around a horse show.Being a Delta Hill Rider is like being a member of a biker club. They have been riding horses for generations, and they take great pride in passing down the skills – riding, grooming, competing – from one generation to the next. The riders go to R\u0026ampB clubs dressed as cowboys and the DJ will play cowboy songs and zydeco music.My interest started by chance, in December 2016, when I was working as staff photographer at the university in Cleveland, Mississippi. I stumbled across a small group of riders during the annual parade and asked one of the riders if I could come and photograph where they keep their horses. He was excited that somebody was taking an interest. He invited me to a Black Heritage rodeo, which was happening the following month.Meeting the Delta Hill Riders has been life-changing. I grew up in Maine, in a place that was not erse. This was the first time in my life that I developed a deep connection with the African American community. I am really grateful for that. I feel like, if people made the time to get to know neighbours who were different from them, it would relieve a lot of the tension and isive thinking that we have.Trained: Journalism at St Michael’s College, Vermont.High point: “The excitement of getting my first magazine assignment.

Since 2010, 773 have closed.The number of paid librarians has also plummeted. In 20092010, the point marking the start of the Tory government’s austerity drive, there were 24,000 salaried staff working in libraries. Last year, there were 15,300 employees and more than 51,000 volunteers.As the number of branches and paid staff have declined, so have library visits: there were 226m visits to libraries over the last year, compared with 315m in 20092010.Cipfa chief executive Rob Whiteman said that while spending had increased slightly in the last year, the figures showed a sustained trend where local councils on tight budgets had been forced to redirect funding to priority services such as social care.“This is the shape of today’s local authorities. As the country prepares to go to the polls, candidates should be having honest conversations with the public about the role of local government, and the future of lower priority services such as libraries,” Whiteman said.Earlier this week, Boris Johnson was asked by the BBC’s Andrew Marr about library closures, with the prime minister appearing to offload the blame on to local authorities, who have undergone dramatic cuts over the past decade. This year, council leaders warned that one in five councils might have to impose drastic spending controls to avoid bankruptcy.Johnson told Marr: “We want to be spending more. We want to be supporting local authorities. But some local authorities have been able to manage their finances so as to open libraries. I give you the example of my own borough of Hillingdon in west London, where they opened libraries … I want to invest in libraries, but we can only do that when we get the economy really motoring.” The prime minister said this could be achieved by “getting Brexit done”.Nick Poole, chief executive of librarian body Cilip, was harshly critical of Johnson’s comments, saying they include “three key misconceptions”. First, pointed out Poole, local library services are the responsibility of local councils alone: the 1964 Public Libraries Act requires central government to oversee and improve public library services – a responsibility, he said, that the previous Conservative government failed to implement.“Finally, Mr Johnson appears to suggest that the country can only afford libraries when there has been an economic recovery. As we have commented time and again, this is a fundamentally misguided policy. By investing in libraries, you create opportunities for education and skills across the country, which in turn creates the conditions for future economic growth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e32821a23ddff881e48b10bd2c9a4682983ac8f/599_55_1882_1129/master/1882.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40de333144f40bc73c20e4cf2e99ba9a","title":"word of week greenwash why not good thing","story":"This term once meant money laundering on behalf of drug cartels, before it became shorthand for environmental propagandaThis week the TCI hedge fund announced that it would dump investments in companies that refused to disclose their carbon emissions and did not provide a plan for their reduction. And it accused fund manager BlackRock of “greenwash” for not requiring the same. Well, everybody loves green things and washing, so why is a combination of them bad?As a noun, “greenwash” has since 1987 meant commercial propaganda that propagates an environmentally virtuous public image – such as ads for oil companies featuring cute wildlife. Before that, the verb “greenwashing” was sometimes used as a term for money laundering on behalf of drug cartels, because the US dollars being laundered were “greenbacks”.Both senses imply the removal of a stain, and “greenwash” was coined on analogy with “whitewash”, the figurative use of which – to mean the erasure of flaws – is first attributed to the Tory leader Viscount Bolingbroke in 1730. Observers who recall David Cameron’s promise to run the “greenest government ever”, as well as Boris Johnson’s current claim that getting to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 will be a top priority if he wins the election, might suppose that Bolingbroke’s modern heirs are also leaders in greenwashing.• Steven Poole’s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/832be9d8d95e7ee313eb0df68789c556da06be15/0_0_4819_2142/master/4819.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61c27d94b5343d7bca8a52c94b4cb990 940w","title":"scallies with matching coldsores its time to stop sneering at northern towns","story":"The media battering of the north of England, seen recently in Jack Hurley’s Rubbish Seaside posters, fosters shame and hopelessness in those growing up there. It needs to endMaybe the driving northern rain has washed away our sense of humour. Jack Hurley’s “Rubbish Seaside”, a collection of quasi-satirical railway posters, has been billed a “backhanded love letter”. To our eyes, as teachers who work with some of the country’s most disadvantaged young people, it’s “backhanded” in much the same way that an emotionally abusive boyfriend calls you fat, but it’s you who can’t take a joke.The series did feature some nuanced and humorous social criticism. Hurley’s depiction of Manchester thoughtfully contrasted the gold-plated skyline with street-level poverty. However, his treatment of towns such as Blackpool betrayed a regrettable lack of creativity and empathy. In a local authority that has the worst public health demographics in the UK – due to savage cuts from Westminster – it seems puerile to poke fun at the “matching coldsores” sported by the “small army of scallies” Hurley sneeringly refers to in his note on the piece. Every good comedian knows the rule about punching up rather than down. Maybe an educative trip to Blackpool’s Comedy Carpet is in order.You don’t get away with it by being from “the north” either. It’s not a lumpen mass you wouldn’t allow someone from Chelsea to speak on behalf of a council estate in Tower Hamlets, so why conflate Southport and Scarborough?Depictions like Hurley’s are also mediated through – and consumed by – a predominantly southern, middle-class gaze. These posters were promoted in a “fun new art exhibition” in Gray’s Inn Square (“Please do pop in, browse and purchase!”). Funnily enough, we’ve yet to see them displayed in all their glory on the railings of Blackpool’s North Pier.In 1981, the Tory minister Norman Tebbit notoriously regaled the Conservative Party conference – in Blackpool’s Winter Gardens – with the fable of his jobless father, who “got on his bike and looked for work, and kept looking till he found it”. Forty years on, northern towns are still facing the same stigmatising blame-game.The toxic treadmill of social mobility is exposed when middle class “escapees” from poorer post-industrial and coastal towns think they have a free pass to guffaw at those forgotten by a fraudulent meritocracy. In 2017, Justine Greening, then the secretary of state for education, recalled with woe her childhood in Rotherham: “I was aiming for something better … I knew there was something better out there”. It’s as if her Yorkshire hometown were a remote planet necessitating extraterrestrial journeys to discover intelligent life.Unless the goal of social mobility is that we all eventually move to London, we need to start taking northern towns and their potential seriously. Rather than encouraging talented young people to leave and take their ideas with them, we ought to invest in entire communities. If moving out is the only way of moving up, something’s not working. And it’s not just Norman Tebbit’s dad.We have both taught extensively in schools in Blackpool and elsewhere. We know that children are quick to internalise disparaging media portrayals of their home towns. Their self esteem is inextricably linked to low self-worth at community level. We see this when they describe their towns as dirty and dangerous, and when they use “council house” as a slur. The constant media battering fosters shame and hopelessness they can’t see a secure and fulfilling future close to home. These kids are told they lack aspiration, but also that there is nothing worthwhile to aspire to where they live. It pits them against their families and neighbourhoods. They can’t win.For every shoddy stereotype in the press, we see a missed opportunity to report on the creativity kindled in response to just these lazy tropes. You might have seen, for example, the isive Panorama documentary in which Blackburn was publicly shamed as “segregated” (or read the ’s four-star review). Blackburn Museum responded with Kick Down the Barriers, a project collaborating with artists and writers to rewrite this toxic narrative. Particularly exciting is an upcoming piece by Jamie Holman and Sana Maulvi, which takes the form of a series of letters to one another exploring the development of their friendship over the years, and reflecting on the stereotypes and cliches they remember along the way. Have you heard of it? No?The north keeps kicking. Blackpool arts programme Leftcoast commissioned Left Behind, a series of works produced in response to a miserable Financial Times article of the same name. The Manchester-based youth leadership enterprise Reclaim celebrates the ersity of the modern British working class.Hurley’s contribution only serves to perpetuate the feeling that locals need to be embarrassed about their hometowns. Surely there are more deserving targets of his satirical aptitude. Communities will always find strength from within when they are let down by those in power. Media outlets, especially those claiming liberal credentials, have a responsibility to amplify these voices.Rebecca Grant started her teaching career in Blackpool.

Or if the polls that increasingly inform our understanding and analysis of politics decided it wasn’t worth examining the views of those aged 18-24? How about if journalists decided that they should ignore Liberal Democrat supporters, irrelevant as we know how they’re going to vote? There would be some outrage, surely.Yet there is a glaring absence in our existing political analysis: ethnicity. This despite the fact that there are more ethnic minority voters than Scottish voters, Liberal Democrat voters, or 18 to 24-year-old voters. In an election where tactical voting is widespread, such polls and reporting may even be shaping how people vote.For example, even the best polling from the 2017 election, YouGov’s MRP model, which alone predicted a hung parliament, still underestimated the Labour vote share in the constituencies with the most ethnic minority voters. While this didn’t affect any inidual seat calls, it did suggest that seats were more marginal in places such as Battersea and Edmonton than results indicated.If we are to solve this problem, polling companies must do a better job of collecting data on ethnicity. It’s true that sampling ethnic minorities would be costly, but it’s also true that private companies are paying millions of pounds to Britain’s pollsters, and that those pollsters are influencing the nature of our democracy, and whose voices and interests count most. With ethnicity such a strong predictor of vote choice, the current lack of ethnicity breaks is increasingly indefensible.But even if the pollsters continue to drag their feet, journalists need to improve their understanding of race and ethnicity in Britain today. We can see the low level of interest in the way that racism is discussed generally, as an attribute of iniduals, or as part of a sensationalist story about celebrities, rather than as a systemic or institutional issue with deep historical roots in our society. Where are the vox pops with young black voters? Where are the editorials about the “genuine concerns” of Asian working-class men?This is both a question of basic data, but perhaps more importantly about understanding the nature of ethnic minority communities in today’s Britain, and of racism. Even without data we have no shortage of journalists touring the country and meeting voters, but there’s been little curiosity about ethnic minorities and their views about Brexit, racism, the NHS or the economy – or anything much at all.Ethnic minorities in Britain are well aware that their voices are not heard. They see it every day on their televisions and in their workplaces. The current weakness of our political analysis of race and ethnicity in Britain isn’t just a failure of research or political analysis. It’s a failure of equal representation in our democracy.• Omar Khan is director of the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb93006fbf9b742f0b6ee69b760334c04c19df24/580_727_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cad28e7e1d64955e6a1cc51b4891719","title":"science museum hiding dirty money over 2m sackler donation","story":"Funds intended for specific project will instead be spread across Science Museum’s workThe Science Museum has been accused of trying to “quietly hide away dirty money” after it agreed to a request by the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation to repurpose a £2m donation earmarked for a prominent new gallery.The donation, which was meant to fund the Medicine: the Wellcome Galleries collection – dedicated to thousands of medical artefacts, including the world’s first MRI scanner– was removed from the project earlier this year as the Sacklers’ philanthropic donations came under increased scrutiny.In 2017, the Science Museum announced that the galleries would have two new key funders: GSK and The Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation. But when the galleries opened in November this year there was no mention of the Sacklers on its website and GSK was named as the only principal sponsor.The museum confirmed to the  it plans to keep the money and spend it on other projects, and said a donor board at the museum names the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation among its funders.The Science Museum said it came to an agreement with the foundation that the £2m gift “would be most effectively applied to support work across the museum’s world-class scientific, technological and medical collections rather than being specifically designated to one project”.The museum has previously been criticised for taking money from BP and Shell. The director of the Science Museum group, Ian Blatchford, defended the museum’s decision to take money from oil companies, including for sponsorship of exhibitions about climate-related issues.The campaign group Culture Unstained said that despite Blatchford’s “regular outbursts in defence of his unethical donors and sponsors”, on this occasion the museum had “accepted that the Sackler name is just too toxic”.A spokesperson said: “Rather than trying to quietly hide away dirty money, the museum should be drawing an ethical red line and turning it down. When other cultural organisations are confidently cutting their ties to oil money too, it’s troubling that when it comes to ethical sponsorship the Science Museum is still dragging its feet.”The US pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma, which is owned by some branches of the Sackler family, makes the highly addictive opioid prescription painkiller OxyContin, and is facing several lawsuits over its alleged role in the US opioid crisis. The branch of the family descended from Arthur Sackler is not linked to OxyContin. The Sacklers, who deny all the allegations, have been significant funders of British culture for many years, and the Science Museum is the latest high-profile institution to have its connections to the family questioned.In March, the National Portrait Gallery announced it was dropping a £1m grant from the family after pressure from campaign groups which said accepting money would make them complicit in the harm its products have allegedly caused. “They did the right thing,” said Nan Goldin, a US artist who has been one of the Sacklers’ most vocal critics and has previous discussed her own addiction to opioids. “I hope there is a domino effect now there needs to be.”Earlier this year, Tate announced it would no longer accept donations from the family because of its alleged links to the opioid crisis. Shortly afterwards the Guggenheim Museum in New York, where a Sackler sat on the board for many years, said it would no longer accept gifts from the family. In July, the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Tristram Hunt, defended its decision to not remove the Sackler name from its galleries.Last year, the South London Gallery returned a £125,000 award from the Sacklers, with its director, Margot Heller, telling the Art Newspaper that “the gallery’s board took a majority decision that it was in the best interests of the charity to return the grant”.Representatives from the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71feb3bb4c0ca18507e33b573feb0a0fea87985c/0_0_1605_963/master/1605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68abd45222073b2f386bf5880d4ec533","title":"spotify wrapped users alarmed by their own listening habits","story":"Streaming service gave subscribers a look back at their entire decade of music consumptionSpotify’s annual Wrapped feature, which reveals users’ favourite music from the past year, has been released to its 243 million users, prompting mixed emotions among subscribers.The feature has become an anticipated event for regular users as it shows their most played songs, top artists, favourite genres and minutes listened for the year.

Experts say the district’s “Data Deletion Week” may be the first of its kind in the country.It’s not exactly an accident that schools in Montgomery county, in the suburbs of Washington DC, are leading the way on privacy protections for kids. The large school district is near the headquarters of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency. It’s a place where many federal employees, lawyers and security experts send their own kids.As digital surveillance of American students expands rapidly in schools across the country, sparking new debates over tradeoffs between privacy and safety, Montgomery county is a revealing example of what protections some of the nation’s most well-informed, privacy-savvy parents think their children need.Like thousands of American public school districts, Montgomery county gives students laptops and has hired tech companies to track students’ activities on those computers, including monitoring what they search for and what websites they visit.This digital surveillance – a booming industry – is marketed as a way to keep kids safe from school shootings and self-harm. It also generates detailed data on inidual children. Montgomery county parents fear that data might someday be used against their kids.This is not a distant worry. Teenagers are already facing consequences for private behavior online. In 2017, Harvard rescinded the admissions of at least 10 incoming students for sharing racist and obscene jokes in a private Facebook group chat. This year, Harvard rescinded an offer of admission to Kyle Kashuv, a conservative activist from Parkland, Florida, because of racist comments he had made in text messages and a shared Google Doc as a 16-year-old, a decision that sparked a heated national debate.Parents across the US told the  that they were afraid about having detailed educational data about their children – like how quickly they complete their homework – being fed into the enormous black box of the data mining industry. Companies have long gathered, traded and sold vast quantities of data on iniduals’ online behavior and consumer purchases, information that is also combined with public voter data and used to create targeted political advertising. Iniduals have little way to know how their data is shared from one company to another, and no power to prevent giant, frequent data breaches.By requiring tech companies to delete data they collect on schoolchildren once a year, parent activists in Montgomery county said they hope to shield kids from being held accountable in adulthood for youthful mistakes, as well as to guard them from exploitation by what one parent termed “the student data surveillance industrial complex”.Montgomery county public schools tested Data Deletion Week last year and publicly launched the program this past August.While not all student data is deleted that week, the district works to clean much of students’ digital slates over the summer, including data collected by Google and by Go, which tracks students’ web searches, according to Peter Cevenini, the district’s chief technology officer.The district demands more than a vague assurance from tech companies that the data has been erased: “They send us a certification that officially confirms legally that the information has been deleted from their servers,” Cevenini said.Go has already submitted its formal certification the district is still waiting for formal certification from Google, Cevenini said.One of the parent leaders of the Data Deletion Week campaign was Bradley Shear, an attorney who specializes in social media and privacy policy. Shear said he was attending a conference for privacy law scholars in Washington a few years ago when he received a phone call from his son’s teacher informing him that the second-grader was in trouble for having Googled the song Fuck You, by CeeLo Green, on his school laptop.Shear said he was certain that his son had not searched for the song on purpose, and that the auto-complete function in Google search was to blame. But the incident prompted him to try to make sure that Go, which the school pays to monitor students’ search and website visits, would delete the data it had collected on his son.The response he eventually got from the tech company in 2017, a pledge to delete or “de-identify” his child’s data, was not enough for Shear. As a policy expert who had worked to pass social media privacy laws in states across the country, Shear said, he knew that “de-identified” data could usually be re-identified again.He decided to push for district-wide changes in how Go and other companies retain children’s data, including working to educate and organize other parents to push the school district to change its policies and require tech companies to regularly delete student data.“You don’t need to keep for ever what these kids are searching for online, or what’s in their Gchats,” Shear said.“Even when data is supposed to only be used for one purpose, it will be used for other purposes,” he added. “We don’t want any of this stuff hanging out and then being used against kids when they apply to college.”Shear met with district officials to discuss his concerns, and he soon found allies on the district’s active parent-teacher association, which has an entire committee dedicated to “safe technology” issues.One parent on the safe tech committee, who asked that her name not be used to protect her son’s privacy, had an experience similar to Shear’s.She said her then eight-year-old son typed in “save the land” when doing a book report on conservation, “and up came the Ku Klux Klan … ‘Save the land, join the Klan.’ He didn’t know what that was,” she said.When she talked to the teacher and suggested wiping the search from her son’s browser history, the teacher said that would not be possible, the parent recalled. If anyone was building a digital footprint of her son’s behavior, the parent said, there would now be a visit to a Klan site in it.“Kids are curious. They’re just going to plug in some key words thinking that they’re funny, and it just might stick,” she said.“I want my child to do whatever he wants to do with his career and his life,” said Ellen Zavian, a George Washington University law professor and another of the parent advocates. “If he wants to run for office, something he did in second grade shouldn’t hold him back. If he wants to apply for college, he should have no data that the colleges have bought that would provide a negative data point.Even with broad parental support, demanding that companies delete student data was not a simple process, Shear said. Parents had to work with the school district to understand what the district had agreed to in its contracts with different technology companies, and to figure out if the contract language needed to be changed. The parents also wanted tech companies not simply to say they had deleted student data, but to certify that they had done so in an official letter to the district.“It was a complicated process,” Shear said. “It was not something that was so simple.”While parent fears over student data and privacy are “newer concerns” for school districts, the pushback that the district heard from a few parent activists also amounted to “kind of universal concerns”, and school officials decided to “get ahead of the game and see how we can address them”, Cevenini, the district’s chief technology officer, said.Amelia Vance, the director of education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum, said that, as far as she is aware, Montgomery county is the only American school district to have implemented an annual Data Deletion Week, although parent activists across the country have pushed for other student privacy laws at the state level.Deleting records of students’ online behavior on a regular basis is a “fabulous” choice, Vance said, but doing it just once a year might not be frequent enough. Video surveillance footage is often deleted once a month, just long enough to be clear if there’s an incident that needs to be reviewed, she said, and a similar 30-day time period might also be appropriate for students’ online behavior.While there are good reasons for schools to monitor students’ internet usage – like making sure that “students aren’t being radicalized on YouTube” or “viewing totally inappropriate content”, Vance said, that monitoring can also be “incredibly invasive”.“It’s essentially a reflection of every aspect of kids’ lives today,” she said. “It is every question they ask in their brain and type into Google to see if there’s an answer. It’s every chat message that they type to their friends, every essay they write for English class.”But school districts also may face some barriers in developing Data Deletion Week policies, she said, including different state data retention laws, and parents’ and students’ desire to be able to save some of their school projects from frequent data purges.Shear, the attorney who led the push for Data Deletion Week, said he sees the rapid growth of the school surveillance industry as a “huge issue” and one that needed much more attention from students and their families.“Most parents don’t understand these issues until something happens,” he said. “You don’t really care about something until you’re discriminated against, or until you lose out to another person based on something you might never even have thought of.”The Montgomery county parent activists acknowledged that their push to change their district’s policies benefited from the expertise of the Washington-area parents involved, which included not only attorneys but people with expertise in security, privacy and politics.Having that kind of expertise behind a parent privacy campaign “is unusual”, Zavian said. “But it doesn’t mean that other communities can’t pull on those resources. They have them. They just have to find them. It may take a little longer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4854eabf8be9787971efe64ea4228b89815272e8/0_193_5232_3140/master/5232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efba20842861e32d04c8de02f5a01e0d","title":"tell us about your run down school buildings","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about school buildings that are no longer fit for purpose.

They’ve helped green issues shoot up the agenda for this year’s general election, with a poll last month revealing that more than half of voters said that the climate emergency would influence how they cast their vote.If it wasn’t for the media these scientific messages wouldn’t be heard or understood by millions of people. And Greta Thunberg’s extraordinary global impact demonstrates her mastery of skills that have little to do with what we usually think of as science.Her speech to the UN Climate Action summit was utterly different from what we have heard before. In fewer than 500 words, she reduced many in the audience to tears when she said: “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!”Meanwhile, on her trip to the COP25 climate summit in Madrid she sailed with YouTube influencers Sailing La Vagabonde, who have more than 1m subscribers to their channel.Greta is still listening to the science, but she’s using creativity to bring her message to a global audience – and as a result, we’re listening. So isn’t it odd that the arts, and creativity in general, are in freefall in our schools?A report by the Education Policy Institute revealed that with government education reforms pushing pupils towards traditional academic subjects in schools, there is a marked reduction in the number of people aged 14-16 taking subjects such as dance and fine art. Fewer pupils studying arts and humanities at A-level has led to a decline in students applying to study similar subjects at degree level.While the arts are vital for arts’ sake, the skills students acquire in the arts feed into those all-important science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects.Stem subjects require research, attention to detail and a critical approach which is useful in any profession or subject. This means Stem and the arts and humanities complement each other well. Many Stem careers need creativity as much as analytical skills, and most Stem roles are about coming up with solutions to problems – and problem-solving is often about thinking creatively or “outside the box”.Research from Harvard University on the global jobs market has shown that while Stem-related careers grew strongly between 1989 and 2000, they have stalled since. In contrast, the UK’s creative industries are developing new jobs faster than other sectors. According to government figures, the creative industries made a record contribution to the economy in 2017, smashing through the £100bn mark. Their value has grown at nearly twice the rate of the economy since 2010. Film, TV, advertising and digital creative industries including gaming are all part of this thriving sector.To help keep the UK’s creative industries we need more university-level training that combines creativity with business skills. People who know how to secure funding, negotiate international deals and screening rights, grow online traffic, identify new revenue streams, monetise content and more, are very much in demand.To ensure universities are teaching the right skills, we need stronger links between regional universities and local creative businesses. One exemplary programme is the government-funded £80m creative industries clusters. Business talent and entrepreneurship is vital if this burgeoning industry is to continue to grow – we have Netflix securing more and more studio and office space in the UK, while Apple TV+ and the BBC and ITV’s joint venture Britbox have just launched.Greta understands the relationship between creativity and the sciences. We need to catch up with her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/091dbac86634562a9353ea6f3cfefcc982ff21a5/0_133_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=195e7d8a0d559b4e19862d72e05171e4","title":"the struggle for sitkas herring photo essay alaska","story":"Dwindling numbers of the fish have led indigenous people to sue the Alaskan government for failing to protect the fishery • Photographs by Pieter Ten Hoopenby Pieter Ten Hoopen and  Jo GriffinEvery spring, the herring arrive in the cold Alaskan waters of Sitka Sound to spawn. But as those waters have warmed, their numbers have fallen drastically.Tribal leaders in Sitka have long called for better protection of herring, a fish that holds cultural as well as economic significance for the people here. To demand protection of the sac roe herring fishery on which their way of life depends, they are taking the Alaskan government to court.For the subsistence harvesters of sac roe herring in the sound, this decline has been accelerated by what they see as the failure of the government to manage the herring fishery properly. Since 2002, the Sitka Tribe of Alaska (STA) has been appealing to the board of fisheries with proposals to protect the herring population.The scale of the decline was underlined in April, with the cancellation of an annual derby that usually sees hundreds of boats from the North Pacific gather in Sitka before setting sail for two to three days’ fishing. This year, not a single ship left the port and not a single herring was caught.The Sitka tribe, of more than 4,000 people, welcomed cancellation of the derby by Alaska’s department of food and game. But the move doesn’t reverse a decade of decline. While in 2009 the derby had celebrated a record fishing season, by 2018 the Sitka sac roe herring fishery was forced to close early because the herring were too scarce and too small.It was the fourth time in eight years that the herring fishery had shut down early without meeting the quota, following early closures in 2012, 2013 and 2016. In 2018 the department had expected a catch of more than 11,000 tonnes of sac roe herring, but not even 3,000 tonnes were produced, according to its own report.While the commercial industry harvests the eggs from inside the fish once caught, subsistence harvesters set out hemlock branches after the fleet leaves, where herring spawn and lay their eggs. Native Alaskans have been harvesting herring in this way for centuries but, in recent years, they have been pulling up branches bare. They say herring spawn now only cover a fraction of the coastline, and fear is mounting within the Sitka tribe that local stocks are on the verge of collapse.At the heart of the dispute with Alaska’s authorities is the question of whether the herring – which feeds on zooplankton and phytoplankton and is a key food for salmon, seabirds and marine mammals – is designated a forage fish. The STA wants the species to be included on a forage fish management plan, acknowledging its importance in the Alaskan food web.The Sitka tribe also want Alaskan authorities to decrease the size of the herring that can be taken to market in order to protect the species, but say their requests have fallen on deaf ears. Herring return to spawn for up to seven years, each year growing larger depending on conditions in the ocean. It takes a fish at least five years to reach the size and roe maturity that processors want.In 2018, the fisheries board turned down a proposal to reduce the level of the commercial catch, and last December STA launched legal action in the superior court to demand a new management plan for the fishery. The Sitka tribe also want the court to find the actions of the fisheries board department of food and game illegal.A spokesperson for the STA explained the action, saying: “The time is now to ensure that our people have the chance to fulfil their cultural responsibilities, which have been interwoven with the herring since time immemorial, and to fill their freezers. We cannot sit by while the state of Alaska shirks its statutory and constitutional duties to citizens. We demand action by the state.”The trial – the culmination of more than two decades of concern over declining herring for the Sitka tribe – has been set for January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0293e31674dcc32626b60cb4b2b82210eb62c1fa/595_735_738_443/master/738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d08fea237e9263690aac8c3e20912e33","title":"vodka gimlets ski prep fashion trends","story":"What’s hot and what’s not in fashion this week‘Masstige’ Beauty buzzword for products with a mass price point, but prestige branding.

The leader of the Black Panthers and his girlfriend, Gwen Fontaine, were on the final part of a journey that had been masterminded by the most important production team in the New Hollywood era: Bert Schneider, Bob Rafelson and Steve Blauner (AKA BBS Productions). Five years earlier, the trio had upended the movie industry with Easy Rider. Now they were attempting to do to American life what they had done to Hollywood: brazenly tear up the rulebook and redistribute power.The producers had clandestinely shuttled Newton to Mexico, then convinced a Colombian smuggler – known only as “the Pirate” – to take the black radical, who was on the run after being accused of shooting a 17-year-old sex worker, into Cuban waters. But Newton and Fontaine struggled in the choppy sea, eventually scrambling ashore where they were picked up by the Cuban authorities. Drenched and anonymous to their would-be saviours, it wasn’t the hero’s welcome the Black Panthers leader anticipated. But it might have been BBS’s most audacious production.It was far from the only unlikely connection between New Hollywood and the Black Panthers. In the late 60s and early 70s, dozens of actors, producers and directors would flirt with the revolutionary group – funding them, championing them and chronicling their rise and fall.The story of Newton and Schneider’s shambolic but ultimately successful bromance is on its way to becoming a TV series in the US with the original magazine story written by Joshuah Bearman – the same journalist who recounted the real-life storytale that became the Oscar winner Argo – being adapted into a limited series. Meanwhile, Seberg – the Jean Seberg biopic starring Kristen Stewart as the American starlet – is released in the UK next month. It tells the story of the star who was plucked out of obscurity in Marshalltown, Iowa after a talent search and became a darling of the French New Wave – starring in Otto Preminger’s Saint Joan in 1957 and then Jean Luc-Godard’s Breathless in 1960. Seberg’s career looked set to continue with big roles on either side of the Atlantic, but her association with black radicals and the Panthers would put her in the crosshairs of the FBI.In October 1968, Seberg was on the same flight as the former heroin addict turned revolutionary Hakim Jamal, who was married to a cousin of Malcolm X. Based in Compton, Los Angeles, Jamal acted as a fixer for the Black Panthers to meet with Hollywood royalty such as Marlon Brando. Jamal and Seberg would develop a close relationship – the Seberg biopic paints it as a sexual one, but her biographer Garry McGee claims it was platonic – with the actor becoming a key supporter of radical causes in Los Angeles.After starring in the air-disaster turkey Airport, Seberg transferred $5,000 to Jamal’s account. She bought a bus for his Compton school, and in April 1969 hosted a fundraiser at her home. Paul Newman and Vanessa Redgrave attended, as did Joanne Woodward, Lee Marvin and Jane Fonda who – before she became infamous after raising her fist in the black power salute while on the Oscars red carpet in 1970 – donated $1,000 to the school. Seberg’s support of leftwing political movements and donations to the Black Panther party were deemed enough to make her “a social nuisance” in the eyes of the FBI director, J Edgar Hoover. In Seberg, the FBI is represented by Vince Vaughn’s clownish agent and his morally compromised partner, played by Jack O’Connell. They are told they must carry on hounding the actor because the orders come “straight from the top” – meaning Hoover, who would sign off on the release of information to a gossip column in Hollywood that indicated that Seberg was pregnant with Jamal’s child. It was a lie – she had in fact got pregnant after a fling with a young Mexican actor – but it spread before she’d had a chance to explain the situation to her French husband, Romain Gary, driving a wedge between them. Seberg had a miscarriage in 1970 – the stress and paranoia that she endured having possibly contributed to it – and a mental breakdown. In a 1974 interview with the New York Times, Seberg discussed leaving the world of the black radicals behind – not because of the FBI intimidation, but because she felt her breakdown had made her a burden. “I’ve analysed the fact that I’m not equipped to participate absolutely and totally,” she said. “I had a very, very bad mental breakdown, and now I realise I wouldn’t want a person like me in a group I was a member of, as Groucho Marx would put it.”She also discussed returning home with her dead baby to prove the child’s ethnicity. “We opened the coffin and took 180 photographs, and everybody in Marshalltown who was curious what colour the baby was got a chance to check it out,” she said. “A lot of them came to look.” Seberg remained in Paris where her mental health problems continued. At 40 she was found dead in her car, after an apparent suicide. The Seberg case showed the lengths the FBI would go to in order to sabotage those associated with the Panthers, but it also highlighted the pull of the group. New Hollywood stars didn’t have to go as far as Seberg they could conveniently and safely tap into the group’s energy at fundraisers in Beverly Hills mansions and New York townhouses. Seberg was inspired to start acting after she saw Marlon Brando in The Men in 1950, and 18 years later the pair would be two of the Black Panthers’ most vocal Hollywood supporters. Brando was a boost for the Panthers because he raised their profile, but he was also a way to financially prop up an organisation that was constantly having to find bail money and needed cash to support a rapidly expanding operation.A donor to the Panthers’ cause, Brando gave the eulogy at the funeral of Bobby Hutton, a teenage Panther who was killed in April 1968 by the Oakland police while trying to surrender. “I’m not going to stand up and make a speech because you’ve been listening to white people for 400 years,” he said, before duly going on to give a speech in which he decried living standards for black Americans. After a fundraiser thrown by Shirley Douglas, then married to Donald Sutherland, senior Panther Bobby Seale reportedly said: “We took Marlon Brando for $10,000, we can take Jean Seberg for $20,000.” They would get a lot more from the New Hollywood cohort.The list of celebrity donors to the group reads like a who’s who of New (and old) Hollywood. Liz Taylor and Richard Burton signed cheques. Fonda solicited for donations to the Panthers at Taylor’s Oscars party in 1970. Mia Farrow, Shirley MacLaine and Barbra Streisand all contributed. But the relationship was not a one-way street: the group found inspiration from the new breed of risk-taking film-makers. As Newton became more unpredictable and isolated as the Panthers’ leader, he turned to The Godfather and would extol “its protagonists’ machiavellian cunning and ruthlessness”. Newton also loved Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song – Melvin Van Peebles’s groundbreaking 1971 film about a hustler who becomes a revolutionary and runs away to Mexico – which had more than a slight resemblance to his own story. Such fandom translated into real-life attempts at film-making. Richard Pryor was a close friend of Newton and was working on a screenplay about the Black Panther leaders’ life at Schneider’s LA home when an accident while freebasing cocaine left him with burns to his face and body he abruptly kiboshed the project. Seale and Newton were also reportedly working on a blaxploitation screenplay when their relationship broke down and Seale fled Oakland after Newton allegedly had him pistol-whipped.New Hollywood documentaries detailed the Panthers’ rise and contributed to their mystique. Howard Alk’s American Revolution 2 follows the Panthers after the unrest at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago as its leadership attempts to form an alliance with poor, disenfranchised whites. Alk’s The Murder of Fred Hampton serves as an “exposé of state-sponsored anti-black terror”, with the documentary maker attempting to reveal the extent of the FBI’s involvement in the young, charismatic leader’s death. David Weiss’s No Vietnamese Ever Called Me Nigger makes the link between the black liberation and anti-war movements, while documenting the anti-Vietnam-war march on the United Nations in 1967.Perhaps the most potent Panthers documentary is Agnès Varda’s 27-minute portrait, which captures the energy of the nascent movement in Oakland during the summer of 1968. Stokely Carmichael, Eldridge Cleaver and Kathleen Cleaver articulately unpack the Panthers’ Marxist ideology, while other female Panthers explain the importance of wearing their hair naturally. Fifty years later, it still feels radical and Karina Longworth, host of You Must Remember This – who dedicated an exhaustive and excellent eight-episode run of her podcast to the story of Jane Fonda, Seberg and their relationship to black radical groups – believes Varda’s film represents the kind of romantic view of the group that Seberg and the New Hollywood supporters may have shared.Other films tapped into the comic potential of the Panthers, none more so than Robert Downey Snr’s innovative Putney Swope. Made in 1969, the same year Easy Rider ushered in the new wave of US film-making, it’s the story of a token black executive at a Madison Avenue ad agency – played by Arnold Johnson with his voice dubbed by the director – who accidentally becomes chairman and then replaces all the white employees with black revolutionaries. Advocates of the film include Paul Thomas Anderson, Louis CK and Boots Riley, who took the voice-dubbing concept to an even more surreal level in his 2017 satire Sorry to Bother You. So what became of Newton after his daring sea crossing? He was eventually released by the Cuban authorities and briefly settled down into a life of sugar-cane farming and motor repairs. At the same time, BBS Productions ran out of steam in a Hollywood that had shifted from late-60s optimism and invention into the late-70s blockbuster era. Newton’s caper was effectively BBS’s last act. But Schneider would have another revolutionary moment, when he appeared on stage at the 1975 Academy Awards to accept his award for best documentary for his anti-Vietnam-war doc Hearts and Minds. He offered “greetings of friendship to all the American people” from the North Vietnamese government, while dressed in a white tuxedo. Meanwhile, Jane Fonda continued to promote revolutionary politics, and the 1979 Academy Awards would become known as the “Vietnam Oscars” because of the political tensions over two New Hollywood anti-war movies, Coming Home and The Deer Hunter.  It is easy to mock the radical affiliations of Brando, Schneider and Fonda as contrived bandwagon jumping. But in the 70s they risked their careers and, in the case of Seberg, destroyed them in order to support a cause. In our age of ephemeral hashtag activism, when stars can send a tweet about an issue and be celebrated for it, perhaps it is time to re-evaluate their radical chic. • Seberg is released on 10 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/790e4100b61f9a2ff0aa8a257418d7c4a350aa13/763_257_5143_3087/master/5143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06a87fc6f6f166a9a3eef58ead633716","title":"crisps cheese and curacao how to have a fantastic election night party","story":"It may be a bit early to bring this up, but on the other hand, it is only a week away: what are you going to eat on election night? On 1 May 1997, a journalist named Gavin Hills held an election party that became the stuff of fable.There was a firework for every Tory, let off when they lost their seat, and the sky was ablaze. I wasn’t there, as I didn’t know him, but people talked about it so fervently afterwards that it has entered my memory as the best election night I ever had – the one I wasn’t at. Hills died in a freak drowning accident the same month, tragically young at 31, and the magic of the election party died with him. Now, instead, we have snacks.In the 00s elections, it tended to be pretty clear who was going to win, because Labour was going to win. I remember doing a Question Time-style panel for some sixth formers in 2010, and some bright spark asked Gus O’Donnell whether the civil service was ready for a hung parliament. “Never mind a coalition, we’re not ready for a change of government,” he said.Even though elections are inherently exciting because you get to stay up late, there was very little to get excited about, few marginals and even fewer surprises.You can have a lot of fun with colour coding when the stakes aren’t very high. I used to make cheesecakes decorated as a bar chart of the vote share, which was a shame as people actually prefer blueberries to strawberries, and kiwi to lemon. You can do the same with tiny quiches (cheese, chorizo, spinach), so long as you pretend to think aubergines are blue, when they are actually purple, and you ignore Ukip for disambiguation, which we all did, anyway, probably for too long.That was quite a lot of work in 2001 2005 was entirely crisps. Cheese and onion for the Tories, salt and vinegar for the Greens, roast chicken for the Lib Dems and spicy tomato Wheat Crunchies for Labour, which are – when in the right mood – the most delicious crisp imaginable.In 2010, the accepted wisdom was that Labour would probably scrape through again. There was just a residual sense that the country would give Gordon Brown one term of his own, because of fairness, and how long he had been waiting. Subconsciously, I must have known that wasn’t true, because my hosting strategy was to get everyone completely hammered. It had taken a decade, but having finally acknowledged that there were no blue foods apart from fruit, and that nobody wants fruit at a party, I went nuts with blue curaçao (plus vodka and lemonade to make a blue lagoon), very red negronis, greyhounds (which are yellowish) and caipirinhas. When the results started to roll in, nobody could understand them – it was like watching dogs try to do crosswords.There is a salient point to make here about how often accepted wisdom is wrong not because polling is flawed or the country has changed in invisible ways, but because of the baseline assumption that things will probably be a bit like they were last time.So, in 2015, everyone was expecting another hung parliament, and the mood turned to ash at exactly 10pm with the exit polls. I can’t remember whether or not people immediately went home, but they definitely didn’t eat the colour-coded macarons, which was good, as they are mad expensive and I hadn’t bought enough.I didn’t have a party for the EU referendum, because it was a stain on democracy. Nor in 2017, because, again, even though I didn’t believe the prevailing certainty of a Tory landslide, I didn’t think I had the stomach to toast it if it happened.This year is different, because I’ve had an epiphany it would have been helpful to have in 2010: whatever the result, the day after will demand more energy and fellowship, not less.So this year, I’m focusing on people rather than parties – which, in any case, are more fun to represent. I’ll take a bunch of marginals and make a finger food out of regionally appropriate snacks. A lot of them will be by the sea (North East Fife, Hastings and Rye, Workington), so fish finger sandwiches. All anyone eats in Richmond and Cheltenham is vol-au-vents. Brecon and Radnorshire is, of course, in Wales, which cracks open the world of the welsh rarebit. Anywhere not by the sea probably has its own cheese.I’m not promising to enjoy it: I might just sit in and eat all this stuff on my own. But I do plan to unite the kingdom in buffet form, and if that means getting in the Staffordshire oatcakes (Newcastle-under-Lyme), that’s fine by me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0383cd2a514005f54ecc03f76b24f3e82090f626/117_71_1167_700/master/1167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8467bd49a4be9408c6faa0ea000d1174","title":"corriere dello sport condemned for black friday front page with lukaku and smalling","story":"Chris Smalling and Romelu Lukaku have condemned Corriere dello Sport’s widely-criticised “Black Friday” headline on Thursday’s front page. The Italian newspaper ran the headline above a story featuring the former Manchester United players whose teams face each other in Serie A on Friday. Roma’s Smalling said the front page was “wrong and highly insensitive” while Internazionale’s Lukaku said the paper was “fuelling negativity and racism”.“Whilst I would have liked to spend the day focusing on the big game tomorrow, it is important that I acknowledge that what occurred this morning was wrong and highly insensitive,” said Smalling in a statement on Twitter.“I hope the editors involved in running this headline take responsibility and understand the power they possess through words, and the impact those words can have.”Smalling also thanked Roma for their support. The club had earlier on Thursday tweeted their disgust of the front page.Lukaku also made a statement on Twitter. “Instead of focusing on a battle between two teams Corriere dello Sport comes with the most dumbest of headlines I have ever seen in my career,” he said. “You guys keep fuelling the negativity and the racism issue instead of talking about the beautiful game that’s going to be played at San Siro between two great clubs. Education is key. You guys of Corriere dello Sport should do a better job at that.”Inter did not reference the newspaper article but tweeted: “Football is passion, culture and brotherhood. We are and will always be against all forms of discrimination.”The paper rejected strongly accusations of racism, on Twitter labelling its treatment by accusers as a “lynching” and in Friday’s edition defending its long-held stance against discrimination.The paper’s director, Ivan Zazzaroni, produced a remarkable defence, saying it was “innocent” and that the article by the journalist Roberto Perrone had “been made poisonous by those who have poison inside them”.The Fare network, which works against discrimination and for social inclusion in football, also tweeted, saying: “The media fuels racism every day. This is today’s edition of Italian sport daily Corriere dello Sport.”Fare’s executive director, Piara Powar, said: “Part of the problem we have with Italy and countries like that at the moment is people do not know where to draw a line. They don’t know what is the right or wrong thing to do, what is appropriate or inappropriate and what might be racism and what might be acceptable.“Would they ever take two white Italian players and say it’s ‘White Tuesday’? They wouldn’t and this is the issue. Why would you pick out two players who are black and highlight their race as a way to build up to the match? It crosses the line of acceptability.”In the article the newspaper appeared to attempt to highlight the league’s racism problem. “In the faces of those idiots who boo, tomorrow everyone must instead go ‘oooh’ like children. It will be a Black Friday, but this is not an end-of-season sale,” the article said. It went on to describe Lukaku and Smalling as “two giants of colour”.Zazzaroni’s defence of the front page and the article added to the anger and dismay in Italy and abroad. “Social media? … Full of noble grudges and cut-price indignation,” it read. “A kind thought a day keeps the doctor away. These days armies of right-minded people flock to the web to whitewash their beautiful souls. You locate the racist of the hour and off you go, in two strokes of the keyboard the stain has gone, you feel a better person in a better world. White, black, yellow.”It continued: “Denying the difference is the age-old stumbling block of the racist anti-racist. The mental slum inhabited by part-time moralists, who suddenly are always on duty. ‘Black Friday’, for those who want to and are able to understand it, was only ever praising ersity, taking pride in ersity, the magnificent wealth of ersity. If you don’t understand it, it’s because you can’t do that. It is an innocent article, perfectly argued by Roberto Perrone, that has been turned to poison by people who are full of poison.”Lukaku and Smalling have made successful starts to their careers in Italy. Lukaku has 10 goals in 14 Serie A games with Inter top of the league, one point ahead of Juventus. Smalling has been an ever-present since his debut against Atalanta towards the end of September and has scored two goals and provided one assist.Serie A has again been plagued by racist incidents this season, with Lukaku himself and the Brescia forward Mario Balotelli among those racially abused by supporters during games. An Italian TV pundit was sacked for saying the only way to stop Lukaku was to give him “10 bananas to eat”.Last week all 20 clubs in Italy’s top tier signed an open letter which called on “all those who love Italian football” to unite to try to eradicate its “serious problem with racism”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01c8345a95bde22c5021c552cc3ab16e89cf0878/0_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8bbe83027bde38537b223be415cc805","title":"everton sack marco silva david moyes premier league relegation zone manager","story":"• Club hoping for permanent manager ‘as swiftly as possible’• David Moyes strongly linked with return to Goodison ParkDuncan Ferguson has been placed in temporary charge of Everton after Farhad Moshiri, the club’s majority shareholder, made Marco Silva his fourth managerial sacking in under four years.Silva was dismissed midway through a three-year contract with Everton languishing in the relegation zone after eight defeats in their past 11 Premier League matches.Moshiri had been reluctant to part company with the Portuguese, an appointment he instigated and ultimately had to pay Watford around £4m in compensation for, but the manner of Wednesday’s shambolic 5-2 defeat at Liverpool proved the breaking point.David Moyes is the leading candidate to succeed Silva with Tim Cahill under consideration to become the former Everton manager’s assistant. Other possible contenders include Vítor Pereira who was overlooked for the Everton job in 2013. The Portuguese is currently in charge of Shanghai SIPG.Moyes has been championed for some time by the chairman, Bill Kenwright, despite his poor track record since leaving for Manchester United after his Everton contract expired in 2013. The 56-year-old is available having been out of work since leaving West Ham in May 2018, although he will not be installed before Saturday’s home game against Chelsea. His first game could be away at United on Sunday week.Ferguson, a first-team coach under several Everton managers, was asked to take temporary charge following a chaotic day that had Moshiri visit Silva in person at the club’s training complex. Neither Moshiri nor Kenwright attended the derby defeat at Anfield but Moshiri travelled from London to visit Finch Farm with fellow board members and the director of football, Marcel Brands.Silva took training as usual on Thursday before Brands instructed the first-team squad to remain behind for a meeting with Moshiri. The players were not criticised for their part in Silva’s sacking – it is understood the 42-year-old was not mentioned during the meeting – but were asked what the board could do to help improve their performances. The directors reconvened and, six days after Brands gave an in-house interview calling for stability and unity at Goodison Park, Silva was informed his time as the Everton manager was over after 18 months.He follows Roberto Martínez, Ronald Koeman and Sam Allardyce as managers sacked in Moshiri’s reign – the under-23s’ manager David Unsworth has also taken temporary charge in that time – and leaves with the lowest points-per-game average (1.28) of any Everton manager since Walter Smith, Moyes’s predecessor. Silva won 19 of his 53 league matches at Everton.In a statement the club said: “Majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri, chairman Bill Kenwright and the board of directors would like to thank Marco for his service over the last 18 months and wish him well for the future. Duncan Ferguson has taken temporary charge of the first team and will manage the side for the game against Chelsea on Saturday. The club aims to confirm a new permanent manager as swiftly as possible.”Silva paid an inevitable price for bad results and was left a lame-duck manager after Everton fans turned on him following the 2-0 home defeat by Norwich, who were bottom of the table at kick-off, on 23 November. However, there was also recognition within the Everton hierarchy of his misfortune with injuries and VAR decisions, plus a flawed transfer strategy last summer.Everton spent approximately £117m on players in that time but also recouped £84m from clearing out dead wood inherited from previous managers, plus the reluctant sale of Idrissa Gueye to Paris Saint-Germain. Gueye’s replacement, Jean-Philippe Gbamin, made only two appearances before rupturing a thigh muscle and has yet to resume full training. Another central midfielder, André Gomes, suffered a fracture dislocation to an ankle last month, while Fabian Delph, the summer signing from Manchester City, has been hindered by several injuries.The failure to replace the on-loan Kurt Zouma in central defence also hindered Silva, who had wanted the Chelsea player’s signing to be a priority, while Brands led the £29m signing of 19-year-old striker Moise Kean from Juventus when the manager wanted a more experienced forward. Kean has started only twice in the league and has not scored in 13 appearances in total for the club.Everton’s board, of which Brands is a part, has been ided on sacking Silva, and his potential replacements, for several weeks. The club has spent around £450m on players since Moshiri’s arrival in February 2016, recouping just under half of that, but a string of poor purchases and bad appointments have resulted in another fight for survival."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82de0582ac0db61696c60cbb05a7ca494cce23a8/200_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e0f6f7a6efc27b2cb39f50c580381e1","title":"sheffield united newcastle premier league match report","story":"It has been a season of homecomings for Steve Bruce and if he went back to his roots when he was appointed Newcastle manager, this represented a happy return to where his managerial career began.He inflicted a first defeat since September on his former club Sheffield United and their heaviest loss in 62 games. The victory elevated Newcastle to 11th, level on points with Arsenal and dizzying heights given his troubled start, and one of management’s great survivors has outlasted Mauricio Pochettino, Unai Emery and Marco Silva this season.He first celebrated victory in a Bramall Lane dugout in 1998, simpler times that Chris Wilder harked back to as he bemoaned VAR’s influence, in particular on Jonjo Shelvey’s clinching goal.“I started off as an apprentice at Southampton at 16, played over 400 games in a bang-average career and went into management at non-league,” said the Sheffield United manager. “I think I have managed close to 1,000 games and the game has changed. Every interview I do is VAR-led.”All of which obscured the reality that awarding Shelvey’s goal was correct. As Bruce said: “Ultimately, it was the right decision.”Defenders have proved the best form of attack for Newcastle, scoring eight of their first 13 league goals. Not this time. The outstanding goalkeeper Martin Dubravka represented the finest form of defence. Newcastle’s previously impotent attackers belatedly became productive.Allan Saint-Maximin opened his Newcastle account with what was, remarkably and ridiculously, their first league goal by a forward since Joelinton struck at Tottenham in August. Andy Carroll marked a surprise first start for his hometown club since 2010 with an assist.The other unexpected element was that Saint-Maximin, whose mesmeric, high-speed dribbling has made him a crowd favourite, delivered the sort of goal Carroll had copyrighted. “I didn’t think he would get a header at the far post,” Bruce said. “It is a classic trademark header.”Saint-Maximin rose above the Geordie Chris Basham to meet Javier Manquillo’s cross with the kind of towering header any totemic target man would be proud to claim.Carroll’s was a curiosity of a performance. “Everyone can see he needs games,” Bruce said, “but I thought this would be right up his street.” But because Carroll was utterly immobile, Newcastle lacked an outlet and were penned in. Yet, just as Bruce was about to bring on the more energetic Joelinton, Carroll helped secure victory. He won a won a flick-on and, for once, Newcastle had a runner from midfield.Shelvey surged into the space. Cue confusion. As the assistant referee Derek Eaton raised his flag the Blades froze. Only two men kept on running: Shelvey, who sidefooted past a motionless Dean Henderson, and the referee, Stuart Attwell, who tracked him more assiduously than any defender.“Everyone in the ground stopped,” Wilder noted. “Jonjo Shelvey even nonchalantly went up and took an opportunity.” Yet Bruce’s assistants, Steve Agnew and Stephen Clemence, were screaming at Shelvey to finish, which he duly did. “Well done to the referee for not blowing his whistle and also to Jonjo,” Bruce said. “That was the directive at the start of the season: to play to the whistle.”As replays proved, Carroll was fractionally onside while there were two defenders behind Shelvey. A harsh lesson for Henderson, perhaps. “The linesman needs to learn a lesson – to keep his flag down,” Wilder said.If VAR is a regular source of complaint for him, a recent constant for Newcastle has been Dubravka’s excellence. He maintained his magnificent form against Manchester City, showing athleticism and ability to keep out Enda Stevens’ deflected shot, Ollie Norwood’s curling free-kick and two close-range Oli McBurnie headers.Perhaps his best stop was irrelevant, as he blocked the offside Billy Sharp’s ing header, but it was laudable nonetheless. “Our goalkeeper has made a couple of world-class saves,” Bruce said. “It is not bad for us to have him in a rich vein of form but the spirit and attitude was terrific.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a273c1a74aa63e07bb03c0167d792abe6052dc04/80_496_6640_3984/master/6640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=406995687b9677b8b2ff0517404cbd09","title":"sol campbell southend manager interview people got wrong end stick","story":"Six weeks in and the Sol Campbell regime at Southend has already claimed its first victim. On taking charge at the League One club in October, he quickly identified the players’ diet as one immediate area for improvement and banned ketchup and fizzy drinks from the canteen. At training, a plethora of fitness and conditioning tests sort the greyhounds from the gourmands. Campbell may still be relatively new to the coaching game but he means business.The data doesn’t lie but then nor does the league table. It shows Southend in 22nd place, with one win and an alarming 53 goals conceded. This is the sort of form that did for Campbell’s predecessor, Kevin Bond, and unless Campbell can turn things around in a hurry – ketchup or no ketchup – relegation awaits. There are plenty out there who would not mourn this in the slightest.Yet to spend some time in Campbell’s company at Boots \u0026amp Laces, the former nightclub that serves as Southend’s training base, you would scarcely know any of this. For all the team’s travails, he is full of energy and full of laughter, eternally grateful for the chance to resume his nascent coaching career after a rollercoaster nine months at Macclesfield, where he miraculously saved them from relegation before leaving in a dispute over unpaid wages. (He is owed £182,000 and is backing a winding-up petition against the club.)And for a man who has graced the game’s biggest stages, this is curiously the environment he loves best: mud and muck, grit and graft. He can still put himself about in training at the age of 45 and almost a decade after hanging up his boots still looks in superb nick.Of course, he is under no illusions. He knows the task is gargantuan. Campbell inherited a team being taken to the cleaners every week. The first game after his appointment – which he watched from the stands – was a chastening 7-1 thumping at home to Doncaster. Only on Tuesday night, in his fifth league game, did he claim his first point, a hard-fought 1-1 away draw against 10-man Burton.“Sometimes you get a team that has almost forgotten how to win,” he says. “That’s maybe fallen away from the standards that should be set at this level. Some are big problems, some of them are small problems. It’s not going to happen overnight but the clock is ticking.”Tough times demand bold choices. One is Campbell’s insistence that Southend will continue to play from the back, despite coming unstuck against Oxford when a calamitous attempt to pass out of defence saw them concede after 52 seconds. “We haven’t got big guys at the front,” he says. “We can’t have 40 to 50-yard punts up the field and expect them to stick. So we’ve got to play through the lines. The main thing is when you make mistakes, you try to learn from them.”It’s a fitting analogue for Campbell’s own journey and as the conversation turns from the coach to the man, it feels an appropriate time to delve a little deeper into one of English football’s most enigmatic personalities. By turns outspoken and taciturn, headstrong and brittle, Campbell’s entire career has been based on an unshakable self-belief in the face of prejudice, ridicule, even outright hatred.His decision to leave Tottenham for Arsenal in 2001 unleashed a torrent of contemptible abuse. His claim that racism has denied him opportunities within the game was greeted with spiteful derision. When he described himself as “one of the greatest minds in football”, lots of people laughed, none of whom actually knew him. And even to this day, Campbell seems to ide opinion wherever he goes. Spurs fans still revel in his every setback, naturally, but even journalistic colleagues warned he could be spiky company. “A bit odd,” was a frequent comment.It feels anticlimactic to report that Campbell is disappointingly normal in the flesh. He is assured, certainly but no more so than most professional athletes. Occasionally testy without ever straying into awkwardness. Perhaps a little more guarded with his words than he used to be, given the way he has been burned in the past. But above all curious, thoughtful and generous with his time.“I feel a lot of people have listened to too many other people,” he says. “I’ve not had a massive PR machine. I’m just a normal guy. I work hard. I like players who hate losing. That’s who I am. The trouble is, as time went on, people got the wrong end of the stick about me: whether it’s lazy journalism, or someone with an axe to grind …”Where did that unshakable confidence come from? “I don’t know. Maybe from the streets? I’m a street footballer. I’m hardcore. Growing up in east London, you’ve got to be a little bit self-confident. As a player, I would go into detail, watch who I was playing against. Who might come into my vicinity. That gives you self-confidence.”Does he reckon that blithe self-confidence was ever mistaken for arrogance?“What do you think?” he asks after a long pause.I tell him I think so.“The thing is,” he replies, “I’m respectful, I’m understanding, I’m open-minded. And if you don’t believe in yourself, who else is going to believe in you? That’s the starting block. If that’s got misconstrued or misunderstood, then I apologise. That’s how I am. I’m not disrespecting anyone. Yes, I have faults. No one’s perfect.”The thing is, without that confidence, Campbell might never have made it to the first rung of the coaching ladder. Whereas contemporaries such as Gareth Southgate and Steven Gerrard walked straight into high-level coaching roles after retirement, it took Campbell seven years to land his first job at League Two Macclesfield. “Waiting on the sidelines,” as he puts it. “Sometimes you do say: ‘Well, when do you reckon it’s going to happen?’ But I totally believed and sometimes you’ve got to take a job where you’ve really got to work at it.”Why was he so set on coaching, a precarious job with a dangerously short life expectancy? Clearly it wasn’t for the money. He returns the question. “Does Frank Lampard need to work? Does Jonathan Woodgate need to work? People need a goal and my goal is to be one of the most successful managers going forward. I love the game. I love the strategy. I love the day-to-day religion of football. So why would I go somewhere else?”Does it give him any scintilla of satisfaction, any extra ounce of motivation, to know there are so many people praying for him to trip up? “But that happens in life,” he says. “It’s normal.”Respectfully, I tell him, I beg to differ. Were I to lose my job, I’d probably get a few dozen people gloating on Twitter but that would be the end of it. Were he to get sacked, or relegated, there are thousands of people who would take a weird, macabre pleasure in it. Probably the same people who sing songs about him dying, or pursue him with homophobic taunts. The irrational animosity out there for Sol Campbell is not – whatever else you could call it – normal.“But when I look at myself,” he replies eventually, “I say: ‘Sol, when have you ever had it easy in your life anyway?’ Nothing’s come easy to me. Nothing. So it’s not like it’s something that’s new to me. No one’s life runs perfect. You’re going to get hired. You’re going to get sacked. In the end, not everyone’s going to like you. Concentrate on the people who are there for you. Surround yourself with people who are positive.”They certainly speak highly of him at Southend, where the mood and performances have improved, even if results haven’t quite yet. The January transfer window offers his first chance to refresh the squad and the experience of Macclesfield last season offers a template for the great escape. “I was given no hope,” he says, laughing. “And I got out of that. I’m not saying it’s a no-hope scenario now but it’s similar. It’s even tougher.”Once the tape is off, we talk some more. We talk about how much east London has changed from when he grew up, about Southend (he has heard the pier is the longest in the world, and would like to walk it soon), about his vision for the club. Above all, you get the feeling that after everything he has endured, he is just happy to be back, even if it’s at a League One club 10 points adrift of safety.“Please God, I’ve got a job now,” he beams. “And I love it. I love everything about it.” And you wonder whether the English footballing public is finally ready to make its peace with Sol Campbell. Because he certainly seems to have made his peace with them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c87ad38e99894b37803c88e2a879a52e9afee8b0/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1076da7e9c38c080558acb7e00997e1a","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Fred is finding his feet under Solskjær, Maddison and Grealish jostle for England attention and do Everton have a new plan?Fred has described Fernandinho has his role model in the past but, until recently, it seemed like the only thing the pair had in common was that they both moved from Brazil to Shakhtar Donetsk before arriving in Manchester. Over the last month, however, Fred has finally started showing the quality that persuaded United to spend £52m on him last year. He and Scott McTominay form a midfield partnership of formerly maligned players who have become more than useful. They, along with Marcus Rashford’s refulgent form and the fact that United now relish being underdogs, are reasons why City might not annihilate Saturday’s visitors to the Etihad. Paul Doyle• Manchester City v Manchester Utd (5.30pm, Saturday – all times GMT)There is inevitable uncertainty over who will be in the Everton team against Chelsea, given that it will be Duncan Ferguson choosing the XI, but one change they will surely make is to their defensive shape. Having played a back four all season, against Leicester and Liverpool in their last two games Marco Silva suddenly switched to a back five. Thirty-four minutes into the derby he abandoned the experiment, bringing Bernard on for Djibril Sidibé and changing his team’s shape, and it would be very surprising if his successor gives it another go here. Everton’s recent record against Chelsea is appalling – between the 2009 FA Cup final and the summer of 2016 they at least scored in 16 of their 18 games against them, but in six of their seven matches since then they have managed nil (with an aggregate score of 14-1). Simon BurntonHaving rested two-thirds of his forward line for the Merseyside derby without negative effect, and with at least eight more games to play this month, there may well be more rotation from Jürgen Klopp here. On Wednesday he even gave Trent Alexander-Arnold a brief breather, with his late substitution meaning the right-back missed his first seven minutes of league action this season. Klopp may have been concentrating on the fact that the 21-year-old was flirting with disciplinary disaster at the time having already been booked, though the Englishman surely proved his ability to avoid incurring the wrath of refs when, after being cautioned in his first three games of last season, he was not in any of his final 37. Anyway, he is one more yellow card away from a suspension, which would take the decision out of the manager’s hands. Last season, like the year before that, Liverpool beat Bournemouth 3-0 at home and 4-0 away. SBFor any Arsenal fans thinking of printing out a ‘Ljungberg Out’ sign and bringing it to the London Stadium away end for Monday’s game at West Ham, don’t bother, and not just because you’ll be too far away for anyone else to read what’s on your A4 sheet of paper. Ljungberg didn’t get Arsenal into this mess, and on Thursday’s showing against Brighton, he’s not going to be around long enough to get them out of it. The Gunners’ problem is that most of the people that could actually help don’t want anything to do with the club until at least the summer, with Max Allegri timing his sabbatical announcement on Thursday to perfection. Ljungberg is a substitute teacher having a bad week rather than the man to blame for deep, structural problems but a quick change or two could make life easier for him in the short-term at West Ham, namely playing Arsenal’s captain and best player, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, in his best position (hot tip: it’s not on the wing). Michael ButlerThe old cliche about the importance of beating the teams around you feels reassuringly pertinent for Southampton fans at the moment. Saints still showed vulnerabilities in their narrow home wins over Watford and Norwich, but the results bore testimony to their resilient response to that 0-9 drubbing by Leicester, a side who, after all, haven’t dropped points against anyone else since either. That mauling put Ralph Hussenhüttl’s position in jeopardy but the Southampton manager was given reassurances in its aftermath by the club’s chief executive, Martin Semmens, that his job was safe. That faith has been repaid by his side hauling themselves out of the bottom three. Their resilience faces another test on Sunday with the long trip to Newcastle, who have found some. But with Saints’ strikers firing more reliably than Newcastle’s – with Danny Ings in particular looking sharp – a third straight win is well within reasonable expectations. Tom DaviesThe two teams beaten in midweek by Manchester sides try to make amends. Before these sides last met, at Turf Moor in February, Spurs had won their last three games, and 20 of their opening 26, to sit just five points behind the title-vying duo of Liverpool and Manchester City. But Burnley won 2-1, Mauricio Pochettino “crossed the line” in angrily confronting the referee, Mike Dean, after the final whistle and Tottenham then went on a run of six wins in 24 league games that culminated in the Argentinian being sacked. So, in short, it was all Burnley’s fault. Both managers have decisions to make regarding their central midfield, with José Mourinho pairing Harry Winks and Moussa Sissoko at Old Trafford to disappointing effect, having picked Eric Dier and Tanguy Ndombele against Bournemouth last weekend. Burnley belatedly gave Danny Drinkwater his league debut against Manchester City, and with Ashley Westwood still injured will likely give him another go.

The clubs have the ision’s 17th and 18th biggest stadiums they have both won two of their last five meetings 2-1 (the other was drawn 0-0) none of their last 13 encounters going back nearly eight years has been won by more than a single goal. Palace’s assistant manager used to manage Watford Watford’s caretaker manager used to play for Palace. The clubs are, in short, similar to the point of mild weirdness, but suddenly there are 13 points between them, and for the first time in a long time one team enters this fixture as clear favourites. It is a feeling Palace might have to get used to: this is the third of a run of eight successive matches against sides in the bottom 10 – and they won the first two. SBNuno Espirito Santo gave his overworked players a rare day off on Thursday after beating West Ham in their 28th match of the season, and they should have rested easily given a run of form that has lifted them up to fifth place in 10 unbeaten matches. There is much that is pleasing in Wolves’ game: they have goal threats from all manner of sources – the largely marginalised Patrick Cutrone grabbing one on Wednesday – but their defence still needs tightening. The clean sheet against West Ham, due in no small part to Rui Patricio’s excellence in goal, was only their fourth of the season in the league and they should deliver another one on Sunday at Brighton. Graham Potter’s side are coming off a tricky run of fixtures in which decent performances went unawares until Thursday’s excellent win at Arsenal. That Wolves rearguard will be tested again at the Amex. TDGareth Southgate best have an early dinner on Sunday and get himself to Villa Park by 2pm. Because he evidently needs to have closer looks at Jack Grealish and James Maddison, neither of whom have had as much England action as they deserve. Grealish, of course, has not had any at all yet, which is mystifying because he is brilliant and there is no other English player quite like him. Maddison, another gem, is probably the closest but not as dynamic. Leicester’s advantage, though, is that they are not quite as reliant on Maddison as Villa are on Grealish. The home team will need their captain to be near his best if they are to prevent Leicester from racking up an eighth league win in a row. Southgate needs to pay attention. PDLast season Norwich and Sheffield United were by some distance the best teams in the Championship. Both believed in a way of doing things, stuck by it and were rewarded richly. They have stuck to their principles in the top flight too, to the extent that aesthetically they would both slot into the top 10 of Premier League sides a neutral would pay to watch. The problem for Norwich is that they are nowhere near the top half in any other sense Chris Wilder’s team, a project longer in the making than the Canaries side that was promoted just two seasons into Daniel Farke’s tenure, seem unlikely to be troubled by a relegation fight and have so far been more effective at both ends of the pitch, notably at the back, than their old second-tier rivals. Last season’s iteration of this fixture was an entertaining 2-2 draw something similar could be predicted this time with reasonable confidence but the sense if that Norwich need to win if they are to stay within touch of the Blades and, at the same time, boost their survival cause.

Following the rejuvenated interest in the “rhythm action” genre brought about by titles such as Beat Saber and Tetris Effect, Avicii Invector takes the cerebral visual immersion of the latter title and plants it in a beautiful, fast-paced beat experience.Made in collaboration with the superstar DJ and producer Avicii, AKA Tim Bergling, before his death last year, Avicii Invector sees you zooming across a series of gorgeous intergalactic landscapes in a WipEout-esque spacecraft, hitting buttons in time to the music on a glowing board reminiscent of the classic Guitar Hero interface. Adding to the trippy aesthetic, the gameplay has you flipping the play space 180 degrees at a time, with interludes of racing through midair rings in time to the beat. Think of Sega’s Nights Into Dreams set to a series of 25 infectious club hits.Avicii’s signature dance music, juxtaposed with this sci-fi setting, makes for a singularly uplifting experience – the game’s retro-futuristic art direction echoing the soundtrack’s mixture of modern and acoustic.With so much emphasis on art and audio, there was always a risk of style over substance. But the almost hypnotic blend of rhythmic tapping and gliding create a compelling flow state experience – at least that’s when you manage to master it. There are three difficulty settings, but even on easy, the game presents a significant muscle-memory-reliant learning curve that will be familiar to Rock Band and Guitar Hero veterans.Progress is rewarded with intercut, voice-acted animations that pop up between levels as your space pilot character, Stella, completes missions across six in-game worlds. A split-screen local multiplayer option turns the game into a party, and this is where it really shines, the anthemic soundtrack making it just as suitable for a pre-club warm-up as it is for Christmas family fun.An early iteration of the game was released in 2017 for PS4 as Invector, but, following Bergling’s death, Hello There Games has finished the project as he intended, with a visual update, new tracks from 2019 album Tim, a multiplatform release, and Avicii branding slapped across it. The latter move could have been a cynical posthumous cash-in, but the result is a fitting musical tribute and an immersive way to enjoy the work of this EDM pioneer.A portion of the game’s royalties will go to the Tim Bergling Foundation, a charity set up by the songwriter’s family to support science-based research into the causes and prevention of suicide, particularly among young people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a56c39cd72933d0ffa967e8dd4b6c81957bd346c/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c12af7dba2e5c7cf0f154aa07cf6fff","title":"un peacekeepers intervene after violent clashes in south sudan","story":"Nepalese blue helmets deployed in Lakes state after 79 people die in fighting between Gak and Manuer communities UN peacekeepers have been sent to South Sudan’s northern Lakes region after a series of clashes in which 79 people were killed and more than 100 injured.With roads impassable due to heavy rains and flooding, the Nepalese blue helmets travelled by helicopter on Tuesday from Rumbek, the state capital, to Maper, about 100km north, according to the UN mission in the country, Unmiss.Vehicles and other heavy equipment have also been flown into the area to support the force. The 75 soldiers are expected to remain in the area over the next few weeks after the outbreak of violence between the Gak and Manuer communities, the agency said.“This fighting must stop,” said David Shearer, the head of Unmiss and special representative of the secretary general for South Sudan.“We are urging the communities involved and their leaders to put an end to the violence and to come together in reconciliation and peace for the good of their people.”East Africa analyst Jeremy Taylor, of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said the speedy deployment to the region underlined the mission’s resolve to end inter-communal clashes as quickly as possible.“While the scale of the deployment is unlikely in itself to halt the violence, we must recognise the intent and speed of the response from Unmiss,” said Taylor.“This deployment hopefully sets a precedent for a faster and more assertive expression of their protection of civilian mandate.”A power-sharing peace deal, signed in September 2018, did much to usher in an end to South Sudan’s political violence, which claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and resulted in one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. But inter-communal violence continues, with cattle raiding, looting of property and clashes and revenge attacks resulting in death and injury, according to the UN mission.On Sunday, armed men broke into an NGO compound in Bunj, Maban county, where they attacked staff and stole property, according to the UN refugee agency.In October, three UN staff were killed after reportedly being caught in crossfire between government forces and rebels. The murders forced the suspension of border screening points for Ebola, which has killed thousands of people on the South Sudan-Uganda-Democratic Republic of the Congo border.The UNHCR condemned the most recent “senseless act” of violence on aid workers “there to improve the lives of refugees and vulnerable South Sudanese nationals”.“While the overall trajectory of violence against aid workers is improving, this attack demonstrates that South Sudan is still an exceptionally dangerous place to work, where such acts are carried out with virtual impunity,” said Taylor.South Sudan has also been hit by heavy rains and severe flooding, with more than 900,000 people affected over the past six months. Roads and crops have been washed out and humanitarian operations interrupted, prompting President Salva Kiir to declare a state of emergency in several counties in October.Floods have taken their toll all across eastern Africa, killing more than 280 people, destroying crops and livelihoods and leaving millions vulnerable to disease. The extreme weather is driven primarily by the Indian Ocean dipole, a climate system in which the surface temperature of the sea is alternatively greater in the ocean’s west and its east. The massive rains have submerged entire communities in South Sudan.

They all have real jobs, your family. They all do normal things and have normal salaries and are normal. “How’s … what is it again, writing?” they ask. And I nod and say: good, yeah. “What sort of thing do you write about?” I am picking all of the Bounty bars out of the box of Celebrations as a stalling method. I am trying not to make eye contact with my little cousin, who just told us about his karate brown-and-white belt. The Christmas music seems to have tapered off. My voice breaks a little, goes soft. “Josh Brolin’s sunburned arsehole,” I tell them, quietly. My aunt says she didn’t quite catch that. Could I repeat it? And in a loud voice, directly into Val’s ear, I have to tell her: JOSH BROLIN’S SUNBURNED ARSEHOLE.Listen, Brolin sunburned his arsehole, allegedly, and we need to look into this, so to speak. To set this up: a recent wellness trend is to sun your perineum, because … I don’t know, the perineum is good at absorbing sunlight? I don’t know. Josh Brolin says he tried it. On Instagram this week, he wrote: “Tried this perineum sunning that I’ve been hearing about and my suggestion is DO NOT do it as long as I did. My pucker hole is crazy burned and I was going to spend the day shopping with my family and instead I’m icing and using aloe and burn creams because of the severity of the pain.” He then went on to use three premium-quality swearwords in a 15-word sentence before dropping the hashtag “#santamonicafiredepartment”. Johnny Knoxville commented: “Taint’ that a shame.” He’s very famous, Val, OK! He was on Jackass! I know you know what Jackass is!Let’s work through your questions methodically and in order, shall we?Do we truly believe Josh Brolin, Thanos from s of the Galaxy, gruff no-eyed everyman and Oscar nominee, burned his tenderness so severely that he had to slide a handful of aloe gel in there and just hope for the best?On the one hand, I do not feel that Brolin did expose his hole directly to the sun. The evidence for this is thus: Brolin is known to be quite a weird, anarchic presence on Instagram, a refreshing antidote to the more PR-approved, comments-workshopped, wrinkles-erased work of his peers. Saying you pelted your anus with the raw power of the sun works easily into that Brolin accompanied the caption with a generic photograph of someone (not him) sunning themselves, anally. It was more a cautionary tale than an actual document of his life as he is living it if you burned your arsehole, would you tell anyone about it?But then a small part of me believes that, yes, Brolin did expose himself to the sun, and it went wayward. Previous form suggests Brolin is a comfortable nudist he lives in Los Angeles, where people do that sort of thing if the sun was there, and the trend to expose your penny to it was prevalent, and you had access to the sort of wide-ranging garden space or balcony that might allow you to do such a thing in relative privacy, would you not try it also? I think everyone around this table can agree that if we had enough sun in this country we would singe ourselves raw under the power of it. No, I won’t lower my voice! I don’t care if I’m talking over the Queen’s speech! Pause it if it’s that important to you!How is this the fault of Shailene Woodley from the doomed YA film series Divergent?It isn’t, directly, but she is a famed pioneer of intimate sunburn, so I am choosing to connect the dots. If you don’t remember Woodley from her pre-Big Little Lies days, her previous form was a sort of proto-Paltrow who clattered through press engagements talking about nature and moss and the idea of water having chemicals in it and things like that. She was big “I have an oil for that” energy, The Girl In Your Halls Who Wore Harem Pants And Didn’t Talk About Her Dad’s Finance Job. In 2014, she told Into the Gloss that, well: “I like to give my vagina a little vitamin D. I was reading an article written by a herbalist I studied about yeast infections and other genital issues. She said there’s nothing better than vitamin D. If you’re feeling depleted, go in the sun for an hour and see how much energy you get. Or, if you live in a place that has heavy winters, when the sun finally comes out, spread your legs and get some sunshine.”No, I ... no, I know you can put a good word in for me at the shop, but really I think the writing thing is –What is “perineum sunning”? Is Perineum Sunning married? What is Perineum Sunning’s net worth?As wellness trends go, PS is one of those that sort of is a trend and very much isn’t, in that exactly one wellness blogger (“Metaphysical Meagan”) has extolled the virtues of it, posting about it in mid-November and saying it was an “ancient Taoist practice that originated in the Far East” (ancient Taoists were revolving in their graves at high speed, horned up and furious that modern wellness bloggers are saying that they spent their lives pointing themselves anus-first towards the sun). The New York Post picked up the idea and linked it tenuously to the 1986 book The Tao of Sexology. Basically, no one really thinks this is a good idea and no one really does it. But it only takes one, doesn’t it? It only takes one person to be wellness-influenced into mooning the sun and someone will figure a way to make a billion dollars out of it (“Don’t get caught sunning without your Schurr’s Intimate Crystal™ – a smooth and comfortable quartz plug that intensifies the sun’s healing rays”).Maybe we are all wrong. Maybe in five years’ time we will all be in the local park, heads down, asses up, saluting the sun in the worst possible way. Maybe I am the idiot and Josh Brolin, tenderly sitting on a bag of ice wrapped in a tea towel, is a galactic-brained pioneer.Wouldn’t you think that flaring your cheeks open and pointing the tender in-between bit at the most powerful force in our universe would lead, quite naturally, to sunburn?My concern with this is that the sun is really bad for your skin, even in winter. If you leave the house without sunblock on, you are just asking to age prematurely. And that’s your face I’m talking about. We have not even explored the idea of trying to turn the nozzle round on the Ambre Solaire and honk a mist of factor 50 directly into the depths. If Brolin did expose his piece to the sun, then surely now he must have the anus of an 80- or 90-year-old man, an anus in shreds, an anus on the absolute edge.So the takeaway lesson from this is: probably let’s not sun our perineums. Take a vitamin D tablet if you need sunlight so bad. Yes, Val, I’ll look into adult education. Yes, I know it’s not too late to retrain. Yeah, I – no, maybe I could look into teaching, something like that. Something normal. I’ll make you proud one day, I promise. I’ll make you stop being so ashamed of me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/872041c51b3dddcd295bdc4938e95ea500bdb66d/256_763_6187_3712/master/6187.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8be95a09f700727bf9c4521206f6722a","title":"im ikeas first female carpenter in the uk and i love it","story":"Dawn Gladwin, 60, on how she spends money doing up her home but is also renovating a VW camperLast year, I became Ikea’s first female carpenter in the UK and Ireland. I’ve long been involved in building work, carpentry, decorating and tiling and other practical jobs. I like how Ikea designs the rooms in stores. However, the kind of roles I wanted never came up, so I found a job in its sales team and within six months, after I passed my probation, I ended up working extra hours in the interior design department. Months later, I was seconded to work as a carpenter in its Croydon store and then I was headhunted for Ikea’s new store in Greenwich. My job involves building podiums and walls in the store – anything to do with carpentry, really. It’s great, I love it. I really like making stuff and really love wood.I’m keen on upcycling and recycling, so I’ll often pick up the odd thing left on the street. At the moment, I’m making a load of garden furniture out of crates. I also have stack of wood ready to make into a boardwalk and seats.I’m currently a property , which I never planned on doing, but after 26 years with my partner, we split up and I was stranded and needed to find somewhere to live.My niece told me about a friend who was a property  – someone who looks after an empty property in return for cheaper rent – and so I researched different organisations and used Dot Dot Dot, which offers affordable properties and in return asks s to commit to 16 hours of volunteering a month. I ended up with a little four-bedroom townhouse in Abbey Wood in London. It’s a lovely place with a garden, a balcony off the kitchen, a workshop and a music room. It costs £560 a month to live here. Bills are extra and come to about £200 a month. I really like the community aspect of being a property . So far, I’ve run a mosaic course in a residential home and helped out with some gardening locally.Although it’s expected to be knocked down in the next couple of years, when I’m not working or volunteering, I spend my time doing the house up. I’ve made it my home. I’m a Pisces and there’s a sea theme running throughout. My brother got hold of a windsurf board and I’ve mounted it on the wall. That’s where my money basically goes – buying materials to do my home up. I spend about £200 a month on materials and furniture for the house.I’ll be given 28 days’ notice when I need to leave, and then the company tries to rehouse you. I think the original timeline for my departure was around now, but it’s been put back and will probably be another year or two. I’m waiting for the property I had with my ex-partner to sell, then I’ll move to the seaside.I also spend money on my VW camper van. I’ve been driving camper vans since my early twenties. This is my third one. I have loads of plywood so I’m going to build some cupboards and reupholster the seats and make some curtains. When I was in my late twenties, I spent two years living out of a van in Spain. I’d had enough of London and so took off and went travelling through France, Portugal and Spain and ended up parking up on a beach on the Costa de Sol.I backpacked around the world when I was younger and I still like to travel and experience new things. I put aside about £50 a month for holidays. What I really like about being this age is how much cheaper it is to travel. You can travel around for pounds rather than £50.One of my biggest outgoings is the mortgage on the place I bought with my ex. That sets me back £500 a month. I don’t spend much on myself but I do treat myself at least once a month to a live gig. I go to a really cool place in Streatham called Hideaway it’s a great little venue and I love jazz and soul. It’s only £10 a ticket and I’ll just enjoy a couple of beers when I’m there.I have a pension with Ikea and one from when I taught at a college for 15 years, so I feel secure about the future. But even if I retire from my full-time job, I’ll still use my time creatively. I’ll still make my art and hopefully that will bring in extra money."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57ac6a94dc1b1d957959280b04999d166c5a271d/0_109_2782_1669/master/2782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=387b40dc77a8814ecfe6cbc1315fe02a","title":"homes adapted for people with disabilities in pictures","story":"Disabled-friendly homes that are easily accessible, from London to Yorkshire"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/088cb496c8a3fd1fd99da1a1dfea68023b9ab2f9/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac76819f38d77ee9ed40b23bf35a4527","title":"50 best albums of 2019","story":"Our pick of the year’s finest albums defiant declarations of identity, lo-fi indie, dispatches from despair and utopian jams.

In these brawny, meandering folk songs, a butcher spouts anti-immigrant bile, an anxious jogger hears of racial violence, and workers in a warehouse flog themselves half to death at a more intimate level, there are infidelities and loneliness.

But nobody perfected the approach like Ariana Grande, whose second album in six months (following 2018’s Sweetener) vibrates with immediacy. After Manchester, the death of ex-boyfriend Mac Miller and a called-off engagement with Pete Davidson, Grande gracefully considers how life could have been and how it turned out, tangling sweet melodies with embattled production. LS Read the full review.The title, the new age font, the tie-dye colours of the album artwork – they all indicate that Hot Chip are getting in on the very 2019 taste for rave culture. While Hungry Child puts an offbeat spin on the sounds you might have heard pulsing from a motorway underpass 30 years ago, the vibe on A Bath Full of Ecstasy is less about revisiting the hedonism of some lost youth than its tender idealism, creating a bright, tender, often ballady idyll in a wretched age.

Without resembling anything so cliched as a “getting it together in the country” record, her fifth solo album runs on that solitary, spartan existence: sad and lovely piano-led songwriting unfolds in its own unruffled time, but then a post-punk scribble like Mother’s Mother’s Magazines upsets Le Bon’s calm, like a momentary wigout at her dislocation from society.

Seemingly stumbling with Gucci Mane through a haze of chronic on My Skin My Logo, glorying in laidback “CP time” on Binz, the beautiful little nest of references that is “black molasses, blackberry the masses”, this is an understated and poetic celebration of a culture. Her love for it is infectious.

Happily, that isn’t the case: featuring production from former Vampire Weekend member Rostam (and occasionally drums from Danielle Haim), Immunity is tender and earnest, its scale in keeping with the way 21-year-old Clairo’s generation shrugs off emotional disclosures with a lower-case “lol”.

It’s full of contemporary ennui as it is, expressed as much in Yanya’s subtly hangdog vocals as in the lyrics.

But peel away the gaudy rollout, two misrepresentative lead singles and the baggage surrounding its creator and you’re left with an endearing, adventurous old-school pop album.

In a statement to the , she said the new thinktank would be called Rise – the Research Institute for Social Mobility and Education. “Social mobility is a big passion of mine, having been the first in my family to go to university, and having started at Greggs bakery at 16 and working my way up into management in the retail sector.”She said she had been the chair of the all-party parliamentary group for education and was also involved in the social mobility group. “The University of Bolton has already done some fantastic work in this area and is a very inclusive university. We have recruited some well-known and respected leaders in the education sector.”The university recently advertised a London-based job for a research associate for Rise on a site which recruits people who want to work for an MP. “Rise is a thinktank based within the National Centre for Higher Education Policy,” Jenkyns told the . “It will have its main office within the University of Bolton and in London, to reflect its national reach.”On the £2,000 donation by the Bolton vice-chancellor, she said: “I received a one-off donation from George Holmes in February 2019. This was a donation in his personal capacity to support my fundraising activity.”The University of Bolton languishes near the bottom of most university league tables, though its head is among the highest paid vice-chancellors in the country and has often been in the headlines. His salary now stands at £301,000 in pay and benefits, up from £295,000 the year before.Holmes was among the guests at the infamous Presidents Club men-only dinner in January 2018, which became the focus of allegations of sexual misconduct following an exposé by the Financial Times. He later issued a statement saying he had felt uncomfortable about the treatment of female staff and had raised his concerns.The University and College Union general secretary, Jo Grady, said: “At a time when universities are under fire for holding down staff pay while those at the top enjoy inflation-busting pay rises … the lack of transparency around this is extraordinary.”According to 2018-19 annual accounts, which have just been published, Bolton University recorded a £2.9m deficit in 2018-19, compared with a £1m deficit the previous financial year, on total income of £61m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/792084258fbace1e87a54b79c268eb7e81e2698d/764_137_2654_1593/master/2654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d14b0bfda6abd3e1171897441e3fe205","title":"can a comprehensive brexit deal be done by the end of 2020","story":"Comments from Sajid Javid appear to suggest Tories are pivoting back towards close alignment with EUSajid Javid has said he has no doubt that the Conservatives, if returned to power, will agree and finalise “a very ambitious, deep and comprehensive” trade deal with the EU by the end of next year.The language is reminiscent of the Theresa May era and appears to suggest the Conservatives have pivoted away from Boris Johnson’s promise weeks ago of a “super Canada-plus” deal and are now back to close alignment with the EU – something Eurosceptics are vehemently against.The majority of commentators think this is highly unlikely, but the answer depends on the definition of a trade deal.Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, is one who believes it is possible. “The single biggest underpriced thing in this whole debate about Brexit is that Johnson and the EU might actually get a trade deal done by 31 December 2020,” he said. “It’s not that I am pushing this as a likelihood, I just think it’s possible and it could catch people off-guard.”He said Johnson’s target was clear and simple: to extricate the UK from the single market and customs union, without much regard for the barriers to trade it would create. The EU could move quickly to get such a deal done.However, others think Johnson, if he wins a majority, will pivot to a deal that aligns the UK with the EU far more closely than he has said to date.“I think Johnson will come under enormous pressure to extend the transition period and I think he will,” said one well-connected former senior civil servant. “The worry for him without a transition extension is to risk getting a really bad deal after having ‘got Brexit done’.”Theresa May talked of “the broadest and deepest possible partnership, covering more sectors and cooperating more fully than any free-trade agreement anywhere in the world today”.Catherine Barnard, a professor of European law, told a recent select committee hearing that it was unlikely a full deal could be achieved by the end of 2020 but it might be possible to conclude a single strand of trade talks.“It may well be that you see a series of agreements staggered over time, and the easier one to conclude would be on goods,” she said. “It is in the EU’s interest to have an agreement on goods quickly, because the EU has a trade surplus with the UK in goods.”Any deal would be likely to be good for the Conservatives. The leave campaign’s mission was “taking back control”.Yes. Lowe predicts that having got Brexit done, the Conservatives would seek to “phase in” arrangements to cushion the economic shock and disruption for business.“You would start with the status quo in 2021 and phase in the new arrangements,” Lowe said. This would be mean a transition or implementation period that could last years.A security deal is also expected. But agreements are needed on a whole range of other issues: regulatory standards, mutual recognition of qualifications, defence, the Galileo satellite system, travel, transport, haulage, the rights of British nationals in the EU, reciprocal health and social welfare arrangements, continued cooperation on research and development in science, medicine and education.If a rushed approach is pursued, Lowe expects the EU will make the deal contingent on an institutional framework agreement being signed simultaneously.This would be an overarching arrangement that could enable talks to continue on other strands but with broad agreement on areas such as justice and home affairs, research cooperation and security and defence. The danger is that this could tie up negotiations for years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1dbe63911376471908172fa8c567a9ca6d0e90f/0_193_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=220a90e8e7b4e1b4d9c0561bb9f16f3e","title":"tory ministers back candidates accused of islamophobia","story":"Exclusive: campaign trips seem to contradict PM’s claim Tories have ‘zero tolerance’ on issueAt least four ministers have gone on election campaigning trips to endorse Tory candidates facing allegations of Islamophobia since the claims against them came to light, the  has learned.In constituency visits that appear to contradict Boris Johnson’s repeated claim that the party has a “zero tolerance” stance on the issue, Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock, Andrea Leadsom and Thérèse Coffey have thrown their weight behind the accused candidates – all of whom are fighting in key marginal battlegrounds.Incidents include one candidate who argued that Muslims have ided loyalties, as well as blaming immigrants for bringing HIV to Britain, and another who retweeted posts from former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson.Johnson himself has also posed shaking hands with a Conservative candidate accused of sending an anti-Muslim tweet to Nobel Peace prize winner, Malala Yousafzai, 22. It is understood the photograph was taken after the party became aware of the tweet.The disclosures came as the Tories face increasing pressure over Islamophobia following a slew of revelations, with the Equality and Human Rights Commission considering whether to launch a formal investigation into the party.Johnson, who apologised on Thursday for previously describing women wearing face-covering veil as looking like “letterboxes”, has pledged to hold an inquiry into all forms of discrimination, including Islamophobia, before the end of the year.Lady Sayeeda Warsi, former Conservative chair and the country’s first female Muslim cabinet minister, said: “There is a gulf between the rhetoric of tackling Islamophobia in my party and my party actually tackling it. Time and time again we see those accused of anti-Muslim racism face no penalty and no consequence.“They continue to be embraced by the party leadership and this sends a clear message that there is a culture of impunity on the issue of Islamophobia in the Conservative party.”Nick Lowles, chief executive of anti-racism charity Hope Not Hate, said: “For Conservative Cabinet members to be campaigning openly for candidates who are facing serious accusations of anti-Muslim prejudice is nothing short of hypocrisy after Boris Johnson promised a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to Islamophobia.“There is no question that many of the iniduals concerned should have been suspended and no responsible politician should be helping them into parliament – they should be doing the opposite and stopping them.”Despite repeated promises from senior figures that the party will not brush allegations of Islamophobia under the carpet, ministers have continued to allow their endorsements to appear in accused candidates’ campaigns. This week, Andrea Leadsom, the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, paid a visit to the party’s candidate in Lincoln, Karl McCartney – who was recently exposed by Hope Not Hate for retweeting posts from Tommy Robinson.As well as posts from Robinson, McCartney shared others from controversial commentator Katie Hopkins over a sustained period. The posts, the campaign group said, contained “anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic material”. McCartney – who is fighting to overturn a 1,500 Labour majority seat – was forced to apologise.Despite the disclosures, work and pensions secretary Coffey also endorsed him during a visit to Lincoln this month, saying: “I think Karl is a man who’s committed to being a person who’s a great champion for the city.” A few days before the Robinson and Hopkins retweets came to light, home secretary Priti Patel had visited McCartney, describing him as a “local champion”.Meanwhile, chancellor Javid joined activists last month out campaigning for Bob Blackman, who has repeatedly been accused of Islamophobia and is defending a slim majority of fewer than 2,000 in Harrow East, north London.Health secretary Hancock visited Anthony Browne, the Tory candidate in South Cambridgeshire, despite him facing calls to be removed after being accused of “disgusting racism” over his writings.Though the Tories hold a comfortable majority, Browne’s bid to become MP is under threat from surging Liberal Democrat support with one poll last month showing the party ahead.Browne made comments blaming immigrants for bringing germs and HIV to the UK and accused Muslims of having ided loyalties. He wrote in The Spectator in 2003: “It is not through letting in terrorists that the government’s policy of mass migration – especially from the third world – will claim the most lives. It is through letting in too many germs.” Separately, his 2002 book Do We Need Mass Immigration? includes a passage about Muslim leaders warning the Iraq war could cause social unrest. He wrote: “Whatever the merits or demerits of war on Iraq, it is hardly a national strength to have a large minority with such ided loyalties during war.” Browne has since apologised.But weeks after his comments surfaced, Browne posted a video of Hancock posing with him, boasting that he has known him for 15 years. In the video, Hancock praises Browne for being “a great champion for the NHS” and says he thinks he will be a “brilliant” MP.Meanwhile, Johnson posed for a picture shaking hands with Brent North Tory candidate, Anjana Patel, who has been allowed to stand for the party despite Conservative HQ knowing she had sent an anti-Muslim tweet. The picture was posted by Patel on Facebook on 12 November. It is understood the picture was taken after the party became aware of the Islamophobia allegations against her.On 15 November, LBC reported how Patel’s name was among a dossier of 10 Tory councillors who had made or shared Islamophobic material. Patel sent an angry tweet to lauded Pakistani activist Yousafzai saying: “Two Hindu girls were kidnapped from their home, were molested and forcefully converted to your religion, Islam. The world should know about this barbaric act by Islamists. Don’t block me. How are you going to help?” She tagged the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. The Conservatives responded saying the party was already aware of cases including Patel’s and “concluded the relevant investigations”.Separately, two Conservative candidates in Scotland have been suspended by the party after being exposed over claims of Islamophobia and racism.It has also faced repeated allegations against local councillors and campaigners. Last month the  revealed that 25 sitting and former Conservative councillors had posted Islamophobic or racist material on social media, leading to the suspension of all of the sitting councillors from the party.More recently Faiza Shaheen, the Labour candidate for Chingford and Woodford Green, accused John Moss, a member of her opponent Iain Duncan Smith’s campaign team, of Islamophobia after he failed to apologise to the local mosque over a series of posts that led to his suspension from the party last year.The Conservatives declined to answer a series of questions from the , releasing a statement saying: “Our manifesto has committed to ensuring everyone’s rights are respected and everyone is treated with fairness and dignity.“Discrimination or abuse of any kind is wrong, and the Conservative party takes decisive action to deal with any incidents of hatred, abuse or intimidation.“Our complaints process is rightly a confidential one but there are a wide range of sanctions to challenge and change behaviour, including conditions to undertake training, periods of suspension and expulsion, and these are applied on a case-by-case basis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d35d8b91c93e597bf5c1c0368f13869ed2cab9/0_268_5532_3319/master/5532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b5df7ba70cb5ac0c31eb4b52f980308","title":"bpa chemical levels humans study","story":"Analysis uses new method for evaluating exposure to bisphenol-A, which is found in plastics, canned goods and receipt paperHumans are probably being exposed to far more of a widely used dangerous chemical – found in plastics, canned goods and receipt paper – than previously understood, according to a new study.The analysis, in the peer-reviewed scientific journal the Lancet, uses a new method for evaluating exposure to BPA, or bisphenol-A.BPA disrupts hormones critical to many body functions and is linked with obesity and other diseases. Pregnant women who are exposed to it are more likely to have children who have problems with growth, behavior and fertility, as well as a higher cancer risk. Many companies have phased out using BPAs, marketing new products with similar replacement bisphenols as safer without sufficient evidence for their claims, experts say.The new research examined levels of BPA in urine but also counted the metabolites of BPA. Metabolites are formed when the body breaks down and eliminates a chemical.Using the new method, the scientists analyzed the urine of 29 pregnant women in their second trimester and found their BPA exposure levels to be an average of 44 times higher than what was measured with the traditional method.Patricia Hunt, a co-author of the study who is a molecular biosciences professor at Washington State University, said she was “horrified” by the high levels her group found in the pregnant women.“The regulatory decisions for this chemical, BPA, have been based in part on the idea that our exposure is so very, very low,” Hunt said. “And I just don’t think that’s true. Our data really challenged that assumption.”Hunt argues that in the US, the new method should be used to re-evaluate samples collected and studied by the Centers for Disease Control as part of its National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). That survey is used to understand chemical exposures to Americans.She said incorporating the metabolites into studies of exposure may explain why levels of BPA in humans appeared to be very low, despite an increase of production of the chemical.BPA metabolizes rapidly when it is ingested, making it harder to study. It can linger longer when exposure is through the skin.Many chemicals are analyzed without consideration of their metabolites, which may not be giving regulators a full understanding of the human health impacts, Hunt said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ab3d167c0d485d5f7e62134b353dfd8977b03a8/0_0_4517_2710/master/4517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=683b86eed6a0c4889ebac8180679ef31","title":"young people what are the most important general election issues","story":"We’d like to hear from people aged 16-17 about the things that will matter to them most in December’s voteBrexit is set to be one of the main issues in the upcoming election, but is the UK’s EU membership the most pressing concern for younger students?Thousands of school students have taken to the streets and gone on strike in the past few months to demand action on the climate crisis.

I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I’ve not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time.”Joshua also appeared to not know what Amnesty International was when told the human rights organisation wanted him to research and speak out about problems in the country.“That’s interesting,” Joshua replied in an interview with the BBC. “I haven’t known much about Amnesty because I’ve spent most of my time in Finchley just training. But as an inidual I try to bring positivity and light everywhere I go. I’m just seeing it from my eyes alone but for sure the country in itself is trying to do a good job politically.“For the sporting side of things, I just feel I’ve got a fight to focus on. For the future maybe I can bear a different kind of flag but at the minute it’s just the world championship flag I’m trying to bear.”Joshua also said he would have thought twice about coming if he thought he was being used to sportswash the country. “If that was the case I’d definitely have to say I would be bothered. But my only focus is just the boxing. We looked at all different venues but this was the one – I just want to do a job.”Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn denied he was promoting the regime by bringing the fight to Saudi Arabia. “It can’t in any way be seen to be endorsing anything, other than our job to provide life-changing opportunities to our clients who take part in one of the most barbaric and dangerous sports that exist,” Hearn said.“No journalist or media outlet can possibly tell a fighter where they can’t go to earn money in a sport like this, to be honest with you. There are so many hypocrites.“Anthony is going to go down in history – like the Thrilla in Manila and the Rumble in the Jungle – two events that also had similar controversy. He’s going to be a pioneer and change the face of boxing in the Middle East.”Claims of sportswashing were also denied by Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal, the chairman of the Saudi General Sports Authority, who maintained that staging the fight in Diriyah was instead part of a wider plan to inspire the population to do more sport and to open the country up as part of its Vision 2030 plans.“Only two years ago women were not allowed to get into these stadiums to watch a football match,” he said. “Now they are allowed and you will see a lot of women attending this fight. But it’s not just that.“They are also allowed to participate and be part of a national team. Criticism will happen. We accept it and we will look at how we can make ourselves better.“We are not perfect but we are striving towards a positive future for the kingdom and that is what we are hoping to achieve.”Addressing Amnesty’s comments directly, he said: “The way I look at it is, we’ve done a lot of changes in the past two years and I think they should embrace that. We are moving towards a better Saudi but we have to make sure we do it at the right pace and that it is within a programme that is controlled.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0db0f7869fc6b62a3c56deabda1e57f45462ae4f/61_160_2806_1684/master/2806.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c6981469d33711efc7323de5357015d4","title":"news uk said to be mulling talkradio rebrand as times radio","story":"Station staff aware of imminent relaunch but parent company has not confirmed detailsThe Times is looking to expand further into radio amid speculation that its parent company, News UK, is considering rebranding the station talkRadio as Times Radio in the new year.Staff at the station have been discussing the potential relaunch in recent weeks, with the speculation over potential high-profile departures increasing after the talkRadio presenter Matthew Wright publicly cast doubt on his future at the station.A spokesperson for the station said no decision had been taken on whether to rebrand the station: “TalkRadio has grown its audience and has presenters that are well loved by their listeners.

The voter at the event in New Hampton, Iowa, who declined to give his name when questioned immediately afterwards by reporters, challenged Biden on the integrity of the business arrangement when he was Barack Obama’s vice-president.“You’re a damn liar, man,” Biden told the man. “That’s not true.” Biden denied that he or his son engaged in any corrupt activity in Ukraine and told the voter to “get your words straight”.Biden also pushed back against the voter for questioning his age. “I’m not sedentary,” Biden said. “You want to check my shape, man, let’s do pushups together here, man. Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test. OK?” This suggestion was met with applause from the audience.As the exchange went on, Biden then appeared to say to the voter: “Look, fat.”Biden’s campaign claimed the presidential candidate was actually saying “look, fact” to correct the voter’s comments.But the rapid response director for the Republican National Committee, Steve Guest, quickly tweeted: “Joe Biden doesn’t know how to treat voters … Not only does Biden call the voter ‘a damn liar,’ he goes on to call the voter ‘fat’.”The voter who challenged Biden came in for some criticism from other attendees after the spat, with one telling him to “get out of here”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a2ad9f57eb7be3e8f7f6977f03ba56804a6f681/526_0_1378_827/master/1378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0b8b5d8e728a010ab0acc4f37f522a2","title":"podshare sharing economy startup","story":"Privacy is rare, quiet hours are sacred, and don’t even think about hooking up. Meet the grownups who call the glorified dormitories of PodShare homeFrom the street, PodShare Venice looks mysterious. The top of a black A-framed building peeks out from behind a privacy-screened chain-link fence on the corner where busy South Venice Boulevard meets a side street of xeriscaped beach cottages. But inside, the yard is typical, not unlike the one outside my own apartment building, 12 miles east in Hollywood – only the grass here is a little cleaner, the landscaping is a little nicer, there’s a basketball court on the grounds, and we’re five blocks from the beach.A tall, middle-aged man, shirtless in yoga pants and a purple scarf, lounges on a wooden futon in the grass, feet together and knees out, in Baddha Konasana position, tapping on his iPhone. A 20-something blond guy wearing American flag shorts and a Vans T-shirt reads a book in a nearby hammock. It’s a sunny, 65F day in Los Angeles, and my first time staying at a PodShare. For $60 a day, each of us gets access to two community kitchens and two co-ed bathrooms inside a converted church building, plus one of the 38 wooden bunk bed “pods”. But this isn’t a youth hostel. Many of the “podestrians” are fully grown adults with full-time jobs – who choose to live semi-permanently in a 50-sq-ft – pod. There are six similar PodShare locations across Los Angeles and one in San Francisco.Each pod contains a bed, linens, an electrical outlet, a small Netflix-loaded HDTV, built-in shelving, one clothing hook and a dry-erase board. Atop the hospital-cornered beds are welcome kits consisting of one rolled-up hand towel, two energy drinks donated by little-known brands, and a pamphlet listing the PodShare rules:One guy lies on his lower bunk, reading. Another, freshly showered, walks past, quiet and shirtless. As dinnertime nears, chatter in the kitchen grows as new podestrians show up a mixture of English, French and German floats through the air. While some are just passing through for a few days, others stay here long term. Some residents have been so committed to the lifestyle that they’ve branded themselves with tattoos of the company logo. One 27-year-old who did not want to give his name has lived here for eight months, after moving to the Venice neighborhood of LA from Oklahoma to pursue a job offer. (He tried a few Airbnbs first, then settled on this PodShare instead.)One such person is the resident assistant Denise Pejic, a 23-year-old Austrian who has lived at PodShare Venice for a year and a half, after answering an online ad for a live-work exchange. Today, she clocks off at 4pm and heads from the front-desk reception area back to her semiprivate pod in an adjacent apartment, which she shares with five other resident assistants. She is one semester short of a degree in history and geography, but she has already fallen in love with the idea of traveling before she gets locked into a serious career.Although there are a few double beds available at a higher rate, “pod sex” is not allowed, so intimacy takes a little planning. “We can go to a semiprivate double room in Westwood,” Pejic says, referring to the 85-bed PodShare known as the DormShare location near UCLA, which has bunk rooms, each with a lockable door.Pejic isn’t the only one who’s formed a pod love connection – PodShare’s latest newsletter congratulates Dina and LaDavius, newlyweds who met on the couch at DormShare and recently returned on their wedding day to pose for photos “to commemorate where it all began”.Tonight, five people gather in the front lobby of the Venice location, Pejic among them, deciding what to do for dinner. “That’s it, I’m ordering pizza,” Pejic declares. “I’m making chocolate chip cookies,” adds a short-haired brunette woman, as she moves toward the kitchen. Little cheers of glee erupt from the group as the cookie maker grabs a roll of premade dough from the refrigerator and pulls a baking sheet from a low cupboard.Elvina Beck, the 34-year-old CEO and founder of PodShare, wanders through as the pizzas arrive, smiling as she hears of the consensus decision. A few people emerge from their bunks and stand around chatting while eating their slices. Beck is just back from a long bus ride from San Francisco, where she’s opened her seventh PodShare – this one with 17 beds – and now she says she has her eyes on nearby Santa Monica.That type of moxie is typical of Beck, who built the PodShare business by hand – literally constructing many of the bunks herself. The Soviet Union–born daughter of a Jewish mother and Muslim father, Beck came to the United States with her parents in 1990, at the age of five. She was raised in Brooklyn until the family relocated to New Jersey when she was in high school. She moved to California to attend Pepperdine University in Malibu, where she studied political science. After that, she worked in TV and film production for a while, but when the economy tanked in 2008, work started drying up and she began floating around, living out of hotels between gigs. By 2009 she had landed in a two-bedroom apartment in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, where she rented out her second bedroom on a then new website called Airbnb. The landlord noticed her entrepreneurial spirit and offered her a lease on his building near Hollywood and Vine.“He says to me, ‘I have this building … got a bunch of vacancies in it. What if you leased them from me and used this new website you speak of – you just put it up on there?’” Beck recalls. “And I was like, ‘Yeah, sure, sure. That sounds good.’ I didn’t have a job, so this sounded like something.”“I called my dad, and I was like, ‘If I fly you from New Jersey, can you help me build these custom bunk beds?’” she says. Her father, who had built and invested in properties in Coney Island, told her: “People want a lot of space, and they want it all to themselves. They don’t want to share … you got it ass-backward.’”She told him his ideas were outdated and explained the burgeoning sharing economy. He ultimately came out for three months. Together, they put up drywall, painted, made many trips to Home Depot, and even collected discarded wooden pallets from the streets of Los Angeles – all to build what is now the Hollywood PodShare.“I really want to be my own boss that’s why I’m doing this,” she says. “No man can tell me what to do.”The $50 per night rate worked for some, but artists being pushed out of the area by high rents asked Beck if she had any cheaper, long-term solutions, which is when she came up with the flat rate to stay at any PodShare across the city. “I’ll do a thousand dollars a month, no security deposit, no furnishing costs, or any utilities, no membership fees,” she says.Next came the 10-bed Los Feliz location, built in a former cannabis dispensary then the Venice one in 2017 then the office building that became DormShare in Westwood a year later and most recently, the location in San Francisco’s Tenderloin district.Beck says that a lot of people want to hear horror stories about co-housing, but there just aren’t that many. The group dynamic, many say, is self-policing and solves a lot of problems. “We had a guy – a resident – accidentally climb into a woman’s bunk one night,” she says. “She screamed, everyone gathered around her and confronted him. He had just come in from a night of drinking and swore it was an honest mistake. He was evicted to another pod location, because though I believed he had no ill intention, people told him they did not feel safe with him staying there. He was fine after that.”This being Los Angeles, television producers have pitched her the idea of a PodShare reality TV show, but the action seems to trend more toward communal meals and board games than Real World–like drama. She jokes about one day having a “pod baby” that everyone could help raise, or perhaps more realistically, opening a “PupShare”, where some could bring their canine companions for people without dogs to hang out with all day.Quiet time in all of the pods is observed from 10pm until 10am, making the evening hours feel like a silent retreat. Conversation can be held in whispers, but tonight most of the residents retreat to their pods, reading, watching Netflix with their earbuds in, typing on laptops, or heading straight to sleep.I fall asleep easily among the 30 or so strangers, until the wailing of fire trucks cuts the air at 1am. Soon after they pass, I hear the light snoring of Robin, the young man in the bottom bunk directly across from mine. Felipe, the guy in the bunk above him, doesn’t stir. Someone coughs in the distance. I get up to pee, acutely aware of how loud the tinkling is. The closet-like slatted doors don’t offer much privacy or sound shield. I contemplate flushing, but my experiences as a twentysomething in group housing and as a longtime citizen of a once drought-weary city encourage me to honor the hippie adage: “If it’s yellow, let it mellow. If it’s brown, flush it down.” In my bleariness, I am suddenly terrified of not finding my bunk – wandering the building all night in search of pod #18, or climbing into the wrong one, like that drunk guy – but I tiptoe back by the light of my Fitbit and drift off to sleep, missing the familiar snores of my husband and dog.The podestrians wake up on different schedules. Some are showered and gone by 7am, others sleep in or take their time getting on with their day. The snorer who slept across from me makes his bed and is out the door by 8.30.Everything is shared – the communal spaces, food on the communal shelf in the refrigerator, the wifi, even bathroom smells and sounds (given those louvered doors). But you can buy a $3 padlock for a locker, if needed. Residents say they don’t have problems with theft, as the openness promotes a culture of safety, with more eyes on whatever’s happening. Antisocial behavior will get you kicked out, and poor hygiene usually causes someone to “ask you to take a shower”, says Beck. Later, a Swedish woman asks for an early checkout due to her proximity to the bathroom. She says it was too noisy, despite wearing a set of the free earplugs offered in a basket in the entryway. When Pejic tries to appease her with a bed farther away from the noise, she declines: “I’m just going to stay with friends for the next few days.”Some of the podestrians purposely keep their residence at PodShare a secret. In the Westwood location, an investment banker tells me he’s waiting on a big commission and doesn’t want his clients to know where he lives. In the small Los Feliz building, a man sits slumped in his top bunk, tapping on his phone all day, plastic shopping bags full of his belongings lined up against the wire rail guards. When I ask him if he’s up for an interview, he mumbles no, that he’s a truck driver with a back injury who “doesn’t need any trouble”. At the Hollywood location, there’s a woman who has been sleeping in her car but paying the $15 day rate periodically to use the shower and workspace while searching for a job. There are also a few like John, a 50-year-old man from Minnesota staying at PodShare Venice, who has been there on and off for five months while working a part-time tech job, deciding whether he actually wants to move to Los Angeles. For him, it’s more about commitment than income. “Six-month leases are stupid expensive. A year lease is hard to break if things don’t work out,” he says.PodShare works for those like Praveen Balaganesh, a 25-year-old who was born in Norway to Sri Lankan parents and raised in India before moving back to Norway. He moved to Los Angeles in January with a small savings, to pursue his dream of film-making. His sister told him about PodShare after watching a BuzzFeed video. “I’m an introvert, so I didn’t feel good about it at first,” Balaganesh admits, describing himself as someone who wouldn’t even shower at the public gym back home. Still, the more he thought about it, the more it seemed like a frugal way to come to the mecca of entertainment. When taking a tour of the Westwood location, he did witness “two half-naked Irishmen wrestling in the main room”. “But,” he adds, “that was broken up pretty quickly.” After first staying in the Downtown and Los Feliz locations, he settled into the tiny Hollywood locale, close to a  station and the coffee shop where his film meet-up group gathers to brainstorm.Balaganesh has four small suitcases shoved under a bed and a few items of clothing hanging on a makeshift rack nearby. To stretch his savings, he usually heats up frozen meals in the microwave, and the only other thing he has bought since coming to Los Angeles is a pair of sweatpants from Target. He has items from his old life in storage in Norway, which he says he has to get out at some point, but he doesn’t really miss them.Almost five months to the date that he first moved into PodShare, Balaganesh leans over a camera on a dolly in the living room of a Tudor-style house in the Mid-Wilshire neighborhood of Los Angeles, calling the shots as director of a short film called Dirty Faces, “about an Italian mafia boss who finds out that one of his henchmen is sleeping with his wife”. He also wrote the seven-page script himself. The lead actor is the roommate of a friend he met at PodShare. She introduced him to the cinematographer and one of the other actors as well. The producer and production assistant were found through his film meet-up group. A mini craft services spread is laid out in the kitchen, where a makeup artist sponge-dabs foundation into the crevices of the mafia don’s face. After Balaganesh checks the framing of the first few shots, he gives the actors some guidance on hand gestures and timing. They review their lines as the lighting is adjusted. Then the production assistant clacks the slate, and the soft-spoken director calls out: “Quiet on set. Action!”The crew has the house for two days – it was rented through Airbnb (they’ve chosen to shoot guerrilla-style, since film permits are expensive) – and after filming and sleeping there, Balaganesh returns to his pod.“I’ve come out of my shell,” he says of his time as a podestrian. “Now I can approach people and talk. As a writer, you want to talk to as many people as possible so you get different perspectives.”A few weeks after shooting his first film, Balaganesh sits at the dining room table in the center of the Hollywood location, along with three other podestrians working on laptops. Beck pops in to fix one of the stairs, which doubles as a storage space, leading up to the upper bunks. “Some of the construction is a little wonky because I did it,” she laughs, giving the step a jiggle until it properly aligns and closes. She shows me the tiny soundproofed recording studio that’s available to residents. “Maybe someone will make a PodShare podcast here one day,” she says. Then she demonstrates how a lower bunk folds up and out into a desk for day use, a design she calls the “Murphy pod”.Maloñ Mahotiere, a petite 25-year-old, emerges from the bathroom five feet away, freshly showered in a jeweled purple gown and full makeup. A few people ooh and aah and ask her where she is going. She tells us she is in town from Georgia and plans to attend a BET Awards party tonight. As Mahotiere folds her pajamas back into a carry-on-sized suitcase, Balaganesh heads out to meet his producer, John, in a nearby coffee shop, to check out their film’s rough cut. Once the film has been edited and color corrected, they’ll enter it in some short-film contests and then start shooting a horror flick that John wrote. To honor his visa, Balaganesh will have to briefly leave the country before returning again, but he plans to return to PodShare until he can get some roommates together to rent an apartment.“I might just stay here forever,” Pejic says.This story originally appeared on the digital storytelling platform Narratively.

I honestly can’t remember, but it’s the experience that stays with me bundling up in mittens, hat and scarf, walking down damp cobbled streets, the Christmas lights reflected in the puddles between them, and meandering in and out of shops without any real gift in mind, just the hope that the right thing was sitting on a shelf waiting to be found.Now, approximately 20 years later, I still love to head off by myself for a few hours, particularly early in the morning or late in the evening, to soak up the festive atmosphere among the other Christmas shoppers. I set off with a list (a heading for each recipient, with a list of likes, hobbies and possible gifts beneath) and make a point of enjoying myself and savouring the experience. Rather than getting caught up in a panicked, gift-finding frenzy, I like to go at my own pace, venture off the beaten track and take my time picking through what’s on offer at each of my favourite local, independent shops on the high street.I don’t make a beeline for a specific gift instead I linger at each shelf, thumbing through books and smelling every candle. I might not end up buying the organic cotton dressing gown I hold up in front of the mirror or the pair of handmade earrings I gawp at through the cabinet glass, but I still love to browse and see what unexpectedly perfect gift might jump out at me.This spirit of discovery extends to finding new shops too. I’m notorious for “discovering” a new place only to be told that it’s been there for years. Stumbling upon a shop that’s new to me down a side street or following a sign to a tiny, almost-hidden entrance is a treat no matter how long the shop has been there. I adore finding another place to add to my roster, run by someone who cares about the local area and wants to make it a home for their business.I’m not alone in my love of gift hunting on the high street. A survey earlier this year from Visa found that the local high street remains our preferred shopping destination, despite the many different options now available. The draw of the beautifully decorated windows, the Christmas songs on repeat (yes, I love each and every one of them) and the personal experience remain hard to resist.Not only do I love the experience of the day itself, but the people make it special too. Despite the festive rush, I’ve never found myself short on help or advice. There have been plenty of times that a helpful shopkeeper, who’s noticed me circling and sighing, has come to my rescue. When I struggled to pick out a gift for a friend and colleague (who just so happened to have recently given me a wonderfully thoughtful gift that I was finding hard to match), the sales assistant in one of my favourite sustainable boutiques took the time to chat to me. She asked what my friend’s style is, what her hobbies are and what she tends to buy for other people. I left with an ostensibly mismatched but flawlessly suited bundle that included posh vegan sweets and a pin badge. She loved it.Because so many local high street shops handpick their stock, they know it back to front. They’ll tell you all about the maker, their backstory and their values. They’ll reveal all the subtly special things about a gift that in turn will make it even more special to the person who receives it. How lovely to know that a maker only uses recycled materials, for example, and then giving it to someone who does the same in their own life. Or consider how charming it is to give someone a gift made in the town where they grew up. Without attentive, considerate shopkeepers, these extra details would go overlooked and a sweet point of connection could be missed.When the provenance and details of a gift mean so much to the person selling them, so too does the sale. I adore seeing my purchase handwritten in a sales ledger and knowing that it’s significant to the person behind the till.

Here are the top Christmas gifts to look out for when you next pop in to a thrift shopAs shopping, and living, sustainably becomes a focus for more and more people, this Christmas is the perfect time to turn to your local charity shops for your festive shopping. Not only will you give what you buy a new lease of life, you’ll support your local economy and share the benefits of shopping secondhand. To give you some inspiration, we’ve rounded up the best gifts you can expect to find in your local charity shop.Winter warmersFrom oversized turtlenecks in fun primary colours to neat cardigans and always-appropriate V-necks, charity shops are a goldmine for knitwear, particularly around the time wardrobes are being cleared to make way for (carefully pre-specified) Christmas gifts. Let their castoffs become your festive finds. You’ll save pounds compared with what you would spend on a new item and you’re more likely to find something unique, so your giftee won’t have to worry about running into someone else wearing the same thing.Board gamesChristmas wouldn’t be Christmas without a good board game to bring everyone together or, indeed, ide them … Monopoly and Scrabble are mainstays in most charity shops but there’s plenty others to suit everyone. Take your pick from the likes of Risk, Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo, as well as a plethora of TV- and film-themed games and the latest releases.Bestselling booksAlongside some wonderfully weird 1970s recipe books, you’ll find scores of bestselling titles on charity shop bookshelves. Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Philip Pullman and John Grisham are all regulars, and you’ll find plenty of new authors such as Sally Rooney and David Chariandy too. While some titles may be a few years old, it’s not unusual to find the latest must-read on the shelves, and keep your eyes peeled for signed editions for an extra-special touch.Chintzy chinaFrom cocktails served in teacups to unusual teapots becoming a major home decor trend, the popularity of chintzy, vintage china is on the rise. You’ll discover shelves worth of it in almost any charity shop you walk into. It’s the perfect gift for someone who likes their homeware kitsch. Why not use a floral teacup as a holder for a homemade candle?Classic recordsWith vinyl records increasing in popularity, why not make a beeline for your nearest charity shop as they have plenty on offer. As digital formats took over, people turned to charity shops to free up their once-straining shelves and, because vinyl was donated in such abundance, many charity shops sell records for as little as 25p. You can expect to find everything from classical and krautrock to electronica and soul.Brand-new clothesWe all know someone who’s a little squeamish about the idea of secondhand clothes. But luckily for thrifty gift-givers, charity shops are not only stocked with vintage finds and pre-loved pieces, they’re also home to a huge amount of brand-new, unworn clothes. A quick rifle through the rails of your local charity shop will reveal a whole host of clothes with the original tags still attached. You’ll find everything from bold, printed T-shirts and floaty maxi dresses to jeans and shirts. There’s an abundance of high street labels waiting to be found and, if you’re lucky, you might just stumble across a designer piece.Vintage sewing patternsMore than a million people have taken up sewing over the past few years, with sales of sewing patterns soaring. However, with some patterns costing as much as we’re used to paying for a fully finished garment, the prices involved can be off-putting. To keep the crafty person in your life stitching, have a rifle through the baskets of vintage sewing patterns you often find tucked away underneath shelves. Selling for as little as 50p, you could buy enough to keep them busy until next Christmas.Statement jewelleryYou don’t have to go to an expensive boutique to find the perfect piece of jewellery – there’s plenty to be found in charity shops and they won’t break the bank. Take your pick from delicate vintage brooches, strings of pearls (likely faux, but you never know), oversized earrings, watches and cufflinks. The shelves are full to bursting with an assortment of jewellery that will suit everyone from your best friend to your grandma.Toiletry gift setsOnce a reasonably priced option for a secret Santa, toiletry gift sets seem to get more and more expensive each year. Rather than splashing out, see what’s on offer in your local charity shop. While some people may be worried about buying lotions and potions secondhand, charity shops are very savvy with their stock. Anything opened doesn’t make the shelves and many branches keep high street gift guides from the last couple of years in stock so they can cross-check whether a set is in date or not.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/2810_672_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c6a1f2409434d9c09472aa8a21693","title":"weve become like a little family of shops we look out for one another","story":"For Karen Harvey, her shop Hoos is fulfilling a lifelong passion for Scandi design while also breathing welcome new life into her local area, writes  Malcolm Jack “I often get people coming in and asking me what the name of the shop means,” smiles Karen Harvey, founder and owner of Hoos. “Everyone thinks it’s Danish or something. It’s actually just how you say ‘house’ in Scotland,” she laughs, “it’s just a bit of fun.”Be that as it may, it’s a name that captures a lot about what makes Glasgow’s haven of gorgeous Nordic homeware such a unique delight to visit. Both in terms of its synergy of fine Scandi and Scottish design (“hus”, pronounced the same way as Hoos, happens to be the word for “house” in the three main Scandinavian languages), and also its welcoming sense of warmth and character. Never more so than in the run-up to Christmas, when Harvey and her staff embrace the rich northern European tradition of bringing cosy light and comfort to long, dark winter nights, with their twinkling decorations and friendly, personalised approach to helping customers pick just the right presents for family and friends.Home has been at the heart of 63-year-old Harvey’s entire working life, in different ways. For 30 years she lived in Suffolk, leading two charities that did revolutionary things in improving the lives, living circumstances and futures of vulnerable young people (she received an MBE for her services). A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes. In the run-up to Christmas they do all kinds of special things such as Christmas jams and other nice little presents. We feel extremely lucky to have them nearby.”497 Great Western Road, G12 8HLPaulin Watches“Everyone loves a watch – particularly a handmade one. Paulin’s designs are beautiful. They’re a young, independent company and they sell lots of other handmade things such as risograph prints by local artists.”407 Great Western Road, G4 9JAShow your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9cb591547d8a37c143c6796e6eaadd462f52131/0_418_6270_3762/master/6270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb6c6694becd030c7442bea4a479c54a","title":"brexit one of most spectacular mistakes in eu history donald tusk","story":"Exclusive: Donald Tusk says it would still be better for both sides if UK stayed in EUBrexit has been “one of the most spectacular mistakes” in the history of the EU and followed a campaign marked by “an unprecedented readiness to lie”, Donald Tusk has said.In his first interview since standing down as European council president last week, Tusk said Brexit was “the most painful and saddest experience” of his five years in office, a tumultuous period marked by the Greek eurozone crisis, bitter rows over migration and the election of Donald Trump.He also criticised the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for branding Nato “brain-dead” and refusing to open EU membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania.“If we want to treat Macron as a future leader for the whole of Europe, in a political sense, then for this we need a politician who feels more responsible for the EU as a whole and not only for France,” Tusk said.The unabashed anglophile, who recently said he would “in my heart always be a remainer”, put himself at odds with other EU leaders by declaring it would still be better for both sides if Brexit did not happen. Many EU diplomats fear any second referendum leading to a remain result would mean festering isions in the UK that would block the EU from making decisions – a view Tusk strongly rejected.He blamed the former prime minister David Cameron for the “mistake” of organising the referendum that “he had no chance to win”. Tusk also revealed that when the two men spoke the morning after the vote, he still hoped the decision could be undone.Tusk said he predicted the leave victory “two or three months before the referendum” when he visited friends in Bath, who told him they were torn over their decision.A former Solidarity activist who was briefly jailed by Poland’s Soviet-controlled communist government, Tusk was the prime minister of Poland before he became European council president in 2014. In that role chairing EU summits, he found it painful to be “more a chairman than a leader” and felt frustrated that he “restrained” himself from campaigning in the UK.He has been one of the EU’s most outspoken leaders, a trait he shares with the French president. Tusk described Macron as “a hope for the future of Europe” and a true friend, but said he had problems with his “very new ideas and opinions”. As well as Macron’s comments on Nato, Tusk also objected to Macron’s rapprochement towards Russia, saying he was “disoriented” by this new narrative.The council president said he was really proud of having once been labelled “a monomaniac” about Russia by a Belgian newspaper. His term began soon after the EU agreed sanctions against Russia, following the annexation of Crimea and incursions into eastern Ukraine.“If we are not able to protect the Ukraine against Russian aggression it will not only be a problem for Ukraine but for Europe as a whole. My hope was that Emmanuel Macron would also be very consistent here.”Tusk, who prides himself on his knowledge of European history, was also critical of Macron’s refusal to open talks with North Macedonia and Albania. The French “non” has plunged leaders in the region into despair, including North Macedonia’s prime minister, Zoran Zaev, who faced down nationalists to end a long-running name dispute with Greece.“I think it was just strategically and politically a huge mistake to say no … after so many efforts and sacrifices, especially in Skopje.”He said Europe would be less secure as a result of the decision, echoing arguments in the region that uncertainty about a European future risked triggering instability.But migration is still “the biggest problem” the EU faces, as a result of historically large numbers seeking asylum or work in Europe. Tusk said it was “presently unsolvable”, adding: “This new version of migration, the numbers, the determination of the people who want to come to Europe, it is something really new but also a permanent situation for the future.”Tusk was speaking to the  and six other European newspapers on the second day of his job as president of the European People’s party (EPP), the centre-right bloc that includes the political forces of the German chancellor and Jean-Claude Juncker.One of his most urgent tasks will be to decide whether Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party remains in the EPP. After years of foot dragging, EPP leaders set up an inquiry into the rule of law in Hungary, amid growing concern about pressure on independent media, restrictions on NGOs and Orbán’s use of the EU as “a cash register” to channel lucrative contracts to his friends and family.Tusk said he planned to issue a recommendation in February, after the inquiry team reported later this month. “It’s for Orbán to decide if wants to be part of this world of values or not,” Tusk said. “This decision should not wait another two years.”He said the biggest threat to the EU came from governments, such as Poland and Hungary, that “don’t want to treat our values seriously” while getting all the benefits of the EU. But he does not think Brussels should have more powers to tackle this problem: “Without goodwill we have no chance to survive,” he said. “But this is also the beauty of the EU.”He stressed the threat to liberal democracy was a bigger problem.Citing the 2016 US presidential race and the Brexit campaign, he said a new element in politics was “the unprecedented readiness to lie on almost everything … to treat a lie as a justifiable tool to win”. He said this “shameless” behaviour would have disqualified politicians only 10 years ago.Asked by the  to specify who he had in mind, Tusk replied: “I don’t want to be too spectacular in my first interview … I have enough problems in my own country with professional and pathological liars.”"},{"url":null,"title":"how green are the houses in your county only one in 20 houses has top energy rating","story":"Just one in 20 Irish homes have a top energy rating, with tens of thousands of households paying significantly higher heating bills due to poor insulation and heating systems.Building Energy Ratings (BER) have been carried out on 853,570 dwellings since 2009, some 51 per cent of the total number of households recorded in the 2011 census, analysis of Central Statistics Office figures show.Dublin has the highest proportion of A-rated homes while Leitrim has the lowest proportion, with just 24 homes recorded as having an A rating amongst the audits performed from January 2009 to last September.A BER certificate indicates a building’s energy performance and is similar to the energy label for household appliances such as fridges and TVs. It is based on a number of elements such as the dwelling’s construction type and insulation, ventilation and airtightness, heating system type, the wall, roof and floor dimensions, window and door sizes and the lighting type. A-rated homes typically have very well insulated attics and walls, and airtight construction, with mechanical ventilation and high-performance double- or triple-glazed windows. Typically, the insulation of the house and the performance of its windows decrease with each letter.Single-glazedHomes built in the 1980s and before typically rate from D to G, with G indicating a very badly insulated attic, little or no insulation in the attic and walls, and poor double-glazed or single-glazed windows.Since 2009, a BER certificate and advisory report is compulsory for all homes being sold or put up for rent, for all new dwellings, and to avail of energy efficiency improvement grants under the Better Energy Homes scheme. Protected structures are exempt from BER assessments.One-fifth of all assessments have been carried out in apartments, with the rest being houses. Leinster is the province with the highest proportion of A-rated homes, with Dublin (21 per cent), Meath (13 per cent), Kildare (12 per cent) and Wicklow (9 per cent) the counties with the highest proportion of efficient homes. Connacht has the highest proportion of G rated homes with three counties, Leitrim (12 per cent), Roscommon (12 per cent) and Mayo (10 per cent) in the top five counties with the poorest rating.Just 11 per cent of BER-assessed homes have a B rating. The majority (37 per cent) of assessed homes are C-rated. These were typically built in the early 2000s, have moderately insulated attic and walls and double-glazing, with average heating bills of €1,300 per year for a 100sq m, three-bed semi-detached home, compared to €380 for an A-rated home of the same size.Almost all homes (97 per cent) built since 2015 are A-rated, with just 3 per cent B-rated. This compares to just 36 per cent of homes built from 2010-2014, a period when the majority of homes (55 per cent) were built to a B standard.\u0026nbspThe average age of all BER rated homes is 32 years. Cork city has the oldest average home age in the country at 45 years, while Meath and Kildare have some of the newest BER-assessed homes, an average age of 23 years.\u0026nbspHow Ireland heats its homes\u0026nbspGas and oil are the main fuels used to heat homes in Ireland, at 40 per cent and 38 per cent respectively.\u0026nbsp Donegal is the county most reliant on oil, with 80 per cent of BER-assessed homes using the fossil fuel for heating. Like other counties including Sligo, Leitrim, Kerry and many parts of rural Ireland, it is not connected to the gas pipeline. Electricity accounts for 16 per cent of fuel types used to heat homes in Ireland, with solid fuel accounting for 5 per cent and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) accounting for just 2 per cent of fuel used.\u0026nbspBER-assessed homes in Offaly have the highest reliance on solid fuel, with almost one in four homes (23 per cent) relying primarily on materials such as turf for heating. Offaly is one of the primary counties for peat harvesting, but its high reliance on solid fuel is in stark contrast to Kildare, another major peat producer, where just 3 per cent of BER-assessed houses use solid fuel. However, many parts of Kildare are connected to the gas network.\u0026nbspGalway city has the highest reliance on electricity as a home heating source, with a third of BER-assessed homes in the city using it compared to oil (40 per cent) and gas (20 per cent). In all of Ireland’s cities, electricity is the second-highest heating source used.\u0026nbspDublin 1-24\u0026nbspJust 6 per cent of homes in Dublin 1-24 are A-rated. Dublin 6 and Dublin 7 are the areas of the city with the highest proportion of energy inefficient homes, with 16 per cent of assessed homes rated as G. Almost half (44 per cent) of homes in Dublin 7 have an energy rating of E to G. These are the areas with the oldest homes (an average age of 58 years).\u0026nbspAreas with newer builds have a higher proportion of A-rated homes. Dublin 13, with an average dwelling age of 27 years, has the highest proportion of A-rated homes (16 per cent), followed by Dublin 15 which has the newest homes (17 years) with 14 per cent of homes rating A. The most efficient areas are typically those further out from the city centre (Dublin 13, 15, 16 and 18) with Dublin 2 being the exception, where 9 per cent of BER-assessed homes are A-rated.\u0026nbsp Ireland in Numbers is an  initiative to explore the stories behind the data.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw A second Irish Farmers Association (IFA) blockade in protest over beef prices is expected to take place at an undisclosed location in Cork on Friday morning. It follows a 12-hour action at a major Aldi distribution centre in Naas, Co Kildare, on Thursday representing the latest in a long-running series of beef price demonstrations. Should it proceed Friday’s action will come just days after the resumption of the beef taskforce, the industry and farming body established to oversee previously agreed sector reforms. The IFA said it was demanding a “significant and immediate” shift in price to bring it in line with European exports. “We will continue to take action until processors give a significant price increase.”According to the IFA, Irish prices are currently 20 cent per kilogram or €80 per animal behind the Bord Bia European price tracker and 50 cent or €180 behind the UK. “The supply chain is delivering mega-profits for factories and retailers at the expense of farmers,” the association’s president Joe Healy said. “We can have all the reviews we like but farmers need a price increase now.”Although details of Friday’s blockade have not been publicised, it is likely to follow the same 12-hour model and come under the official IFA banner. Outside Aldi two tractors, a flatbed trailer and three large bales of hay were used to cut off access to the facility. About 100 farmers attended throughout the day. The German retailer said it was “extremely disappointed” by the protest, and that it had a policy of open communications with stakeholders, including the IFA. BlockadesThe move followed recent tractor protests in Dublin city by “independent” farmers as well as factory blockades last summer. During those events the IFA was criticised for its lack of participation. Representative body Meat Industry Ireland (MII) said the IFA blockade was “an irresponsible and completely unjustified stunt”, and accused it of undermining efforts to resolve the crisis at an official level. “Disrupting normal business operations and harming the livelihoods of associated service providers does nothing to help the market situation,” it said .Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said on Thursday that farmers “should be paid the maximum price the market will allow”, and urged positive engagement through producer organisations and the beef market taskforce A number of industry sources pointed out that the IFA blockade coincided with a report published in the Irish Farmers Journal noting an imminent rise in beef prices. The Journal reported that during Tuesday’s beef taskforce meeting MII accepted that rising prices in key export markets should result in “positive price developments soon”. However, it added that a lack of a solid commitment to an immediate increase has angered farmers. RetailersThe Beef Plan Movement, another group agitating for price increases and sector reforms, said the IFA action was “regrettable” as Aldi, unlike many other retailers, had recently come out in support of Irish beef farmers. The supermarket chain, it said, was undertaking to work with the beef taskforce. “Why has the IFA chosen to protest outside a retailer who has given a firm commitment to work with and support Irish beef farmers?” it said.

It should be clear then after a night of counting whether prime minister Boris Johnson has the clear majority he needs to pass the withdrawal agreement, and the leaders will discuss any immediate challenges arising.The UK is due to leave the EU on January 31st if the Commons approves the withdrawal agreement, and then enters a transition period until the end of 2020, during which the old rulesrights still apply.If the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the end of January, the UK crashes out in a no-deal scenario or may be allowed another extension if sought.The draft conclusions say the EU “reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future relationship with the UK in line with the political declaration and respecting the previously agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations”.MandateTo that end the summit will mandate the commission to urgently propose a detailed mandate for the talks to the general affairs council of Europe ministers: “Negotiations should be organised in a way that makes the best possible use of the limited time available for negotiation and ratification by the end of the transition.”\u0026nbspThe aspiration to conclude such talks by the end of 2020 will be welcome in London, although there is no guarantee that the timeframe will actually be achieved.The leaders will charge the general affairs council, their ambassadors to the EU, and a specialist working group to oversee the negotiating process led by Mr Barnier “in a spirit of unity and transparency with all member states”, replicating the approach taken in the first phase of talks on the withdrawal agreement.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The cost of rice fell to six-month lows as new crop arrivals added pressure.The vegetable-oil price index rose 10.4 per cent to 150.6 points, reaching its highest since May 2018, led by firmer palm-oil prices, which strengthened on robust import demand, increased biodiesel use and concerns over possible supply shortages.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Firefighters work to contain a large fire at an industrial building at Inlet Road inn Auckland, New ZealandDoan Quynh Nam Tran of Vietnam competes in the women\u0027s gymnastics at the SEA Games (Southeast Asian Games) in ManilaA youth plays on foamy discharge, caused by pollutants, as it mixes with the surf at a beach in ChennaiSoutheast Asian Games at the Royce Hotel, Mabalacat, Philippines.

It was actually revised up a bit, to 49.3 from a flash estimate of 48.6, which is better than a kick in the teeth.\u0026nbspIt stood at 50 (flat) last month.

It’s also behind the pound’s rise from its unhealthy position on the ropes. \u0026nbspCurrency traders think it’s in the bag for Boris Johnson, that he’ll get his dismal “deal” through and that the risks of chaos will be diminished as a result. Not being overly fond of Jeremy Corbyn, they’re also quite pleased to see Labour’s poll ratings becalmed.\u0026nbspThey may be missing the bigger picture given the fraught negotiations on trade that will follow and play a big role in sentiment moving forward. How often does that need repeating? Quite a lot, it seems.\u0026nbspThe UK will simply swapping one form of uncertainty for another if Johnson wins a majority. That helps to explain why the services sector remains so weak and may continue to be weak until there is something resembling clarity on the UK’s relationship with its biggest trading partner.\u0026nbspOne of the many tragedies of Brexit is how little attention\u0026nbspservices were given during the negotiations and how little thought has been directed towards\u0026nbspthe impact Brexit will have on this crucial sector moving forward.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Labour’s largest funding pledge, to abolish university tuition fees, will be of no benefit to attainment or reducing the disadvantage gap.”Gove’s GCSE changes widened grades gap between poorer pupils and peersNatalie Perera, executive director and head of research at EPI, said: “All of the main parties are united by one thing – bold ambitions to raise attainment and close gaps.\u0026nbsp“However, our analysis shows that while each party has some well-designed and helpful policies, none has a properly evidence-based strategy to meet their ambitions.”Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “It is right to highlight the inequitable nature of education in England and to scrutinise the ways in which the parties aim to address it. The judgment that ‘the measures set out in the Conservative manifesto are unlikely to have a significant impact on closing the disadvantage gap’ is shared by the union.”Angela Rayner, shadow education secretary for Labour, said: “As this report points out, the Conservative manifesto does not even mention the pupil premium, which will leave many school leaders concerned that it could be cut or abolished altogether.”She added: “Labour will radically improve the life chances of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds at every stage of their education.“From free, high-quality early years education and restoring the pupil premium, to bringing back the Education Maintenance Allowance and maintenance grants.”The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have been approached for comment.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So the ambition is to encourage students to think outside the box, and imagine an interpretation of politics that could even be considered to be positive and optimistic – politics as the avoidance of conflict.\u0026nbsp“The best responses will notice that terms like ‘war’ can mean physical acts of violence, but could also include cyberwarfare, or financial piracy. And, politics could be considered at the level of states and all the way down to the level of families.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By asking this, we are looking for the candidate to think critically about experimental design, and what we can learn from the results.\u0026nbsp“For example, does the experiment have a clear hypothesis and predictions? Is it well designed to test these? Are the methods used appropriate? Does the experiment have necessary control conditions?”He added: “As well as thinking critically, we’re also looking for the candidate to think creatively, for example about how the experiment could be improved and what the results of such an experiment might tell us about how people think and how the brain works.”The advice comes as thousands of prospective students are due to attend interviews at the university this month.Dr Khan said: “There are no trick questions, everything that we ask has a purpose, and that is to show us how a student thinks and responds to new ideas and information, in an academic conversation akin to the tutorials that they will take part in if they come to Oxford to study.”University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

New users are also able to simply lie about their age in order to set up an account.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Historically, we didn’t require people to tell us their age because we wanted Instagram to be a place where everyone can express themselves fully – irrespective of their identity,” Instagram wrote in a blog post.\u0026nbsp“In the spirit of that decision, we won’t show people’s birthday information to others in the community.”Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts.

Instagram also said it would recommend younger users to choose stronger privacy settings to prevent strangers from contacting or following them.Age information would “keep young people safer and enable more age-appropriate experiences overall,” the app said.Under the US Child Online Privacy Protection Act (Coppa), it is illegal for tech companies to gather data on anyone under 13. However, consumer advocacy groups claim that Facebook has consistently violated Coppa\u0026nbsp by profiting from the data collection of children.\u0026nbspFacebook apps account for nearly half of all child abuse reports“Tech companies like Facebook have built a business model based on harvesting, analysing, and selling massive amounts of user data, including the data of vulnerable people like children – putting all of us at risk,”\u0026nbspEvan Greer, campaign director at US digital rights group Fight For the Future, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsplast year.Beyond illegal data gathering, fears have also been raised about online child sex crimes taking place on Facebook-owned apps.A study published this week revealed that nearly half of all online child sex abuse took place across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp in 2018.\u0026nbspIn the UK, around 1,000 of instances reported to the police took place on Instagram.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Exploring the multitude of shapes and exposing the wear of the telescope, each photo in the series stands alone or can be viewed collectively, either way, they present a powerful portrayal of machine that helps humankind in their endeavours to understand space and time. - Marge BradshawIt let them eat\u0026nbspoverripe, fermented fruits that had fallen onto the ground, which those rival populations could not.Monkeys still cannot\u0026nbsptolerate the ethanol in overripe fruits, and the authors say this new source of calories “might have brought apes back from the brink” of extinction.Dr Hockings, a senior lecturer in conservation science at the University of Exeter, said: “Even today we see great apes eating fermented fruit and even drinking palm wine produced by humans.“It’s hard to be certain of why they do this, and this reflects the complex history of our own relationship with alcohol.Everything you need to know about alcohol units“One interesting point is that the alcohol level in fallen fruit is usually between about\u0026nbsp1 and 4 per cent – something like weak beer – yet much of the alcohol consumed by humans today is far stronger than this.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This year, for the first time, it also takes in the last decade, wrapping up all of the songs from the 2000s.But many users said they were unable to actually load their report. While some were able to connect as normal, others said that the Wrapped feature simply failed to load.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe issues appeared to be particularly prevalent on Android.Users said they were clicking the big ad that has appeared in the app but that nothing happened when they did.There does not appear to be any obvious fix to the problem, but force-quitting the app and opening it again could make it work. It may also be possible to access the Wrapped feature on another device.Though the special service was launched today and commemorates the end of the year, it should be possible to access the 2019 version of Wrapped for some time. That means that it should be available even if the problems take a while to fix.How to find your most played songs and artists of the year on SpotifyIt can also be accessed on the web, by heading to Spotify\u0027s devoted site.For the first year, Apple Music is also offering its own version of the tool.

On average they had negative financial and property wealth of £4,900 in 2018, up from £3,900 in 2014.The data also highlights a growing regional ide. Total wealth in London has jumped almost 80 per cent since 2008 while the east midlands and northeast are both more than 10 per cent down. London also has the largest ide between wealthy and poor citizens of any UK region.Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, said: “These figures reveal that wealth inequality has increased over the past decade and remains stubbornly high. This has real-world consequences. Access to wealth gives you more life opportunities and better health.”\u0026nbsp“Inequality has been a major talking point in this election. Taxing wealth more has to be part of the solution if we are to get the public services voters consistently say they want.”The wealth boom has not been mirrored in wage growth, with average wages still slightly below a peak reached in 2008. Household debt, including loans and credit cards, is also rising, up 11 per cent to £119bn in the two years to March 2018.George Bangham, research analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While incomes have stagnated over the past decade, our national wealth has continued to boom.“But the UK’s £14.6 trillion of wealth is highly concentrated and unequally spread. The richest 10 per cent of households have benefitted most from the recent wealth boom, and own almost half of the nation’s wealth.\u0026nbsp“In contrast, typical households in parts of the north and midlands are still no wealthier than they were before the financial crisis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some will face genuine hardship because of the loss of earnings.RMT members say theyre striking for passenger safety, but this is just a smokescreenThose who try to use the skeleton service face massive overcrowding, congested s and packed carriages.One woman even fainted yesterday on the . line from Woking to Waterloo yesterday morning because of over-crowding.The current strike is part of a long-running dispute on the railways over union objections to the introduction of driver-only operated trains.Since , there have been regular walkouts, such as the three days of strike action on South Western in January last year, which saw the cancellation of  trains.This time, the RMT claims that it is acting “in defence of passenger safety” over changes in the guards’ job descriptions and the removal of their responsibilities of operating the train doors.But this is just a smokescreen. The genuine, more sinister, motivations for the strike are twofold: first to defend their members’ present conditions, no matter how outdated, inefficient or inappropriate second, to promote Labour’s agenda of nationalisation by discrediting the private operators.It is no coincidence that the RMT’s biggest ever strike began during the final full week of campaigning in the General Election.No sector in the British economy would welcome a Jeremy Corbyn government more the trade unions, which are desperate to win back the influence they held in the s.In turn, Labour is seeking to win over disillusioned rail passengers by promising massive cuts in ticket prices.Just as the RMT strike began today, Corbyn’s party announced that it would reduce regulated fares by  per cent, a move cynically targeted at commuters.The unions barons have a stranglehold on Labour, not least because they effectively bankroll the party. It is no exaggeration to say that Labour is the political wing of the union movement.Out of the total donations of £ million to Labour in , the unions gave £. million.The biggest sum, £ million, came from UNITE, led by Corbyn ally “Red Len” McCluskey, the hard-left Merseysider who once boasted that he had led more strikes than any other union boss in Britain.Last week, it was revealed that UNITE has just handed over a further £ million to Labour’s General Election fund.A further £, came from the Communication Workers Union, which has been threatening disruption in the Royal Mail in the run-up to Christmas.That spirit of confrontation would dramatically worsen under Corbyn.If he became PM, he would make it much easier for the unions to hold strikes.His Government would repeal most of the vital reforms introduced by Margaret Thatcher, such as restraints on picketing, democratic rules on ballots and bans on sympathy walkouts.Corbyn’s manesto states that his party plans “to remove unnecessary restrictions on industrial action”, as part of a drive “to create new rights and freedoms for trade unions.”That is a recipe for permanent industrial crisis and economic meltdown.A Corbyn-led Government will turn the clock back to the s, when the bullying union barons brought the country to a standstill.Last year, just , working days were lost to strike action. In , the total was  million and in , during the Winter of Discontent, a colossal . million working days were lost.For most of the British people, that period was a nightmare. But for Corbyn, McDonnell and their allies in the trade unions, it was a time of glorious advance.Their party and supporters are the very last people who would stand up to the trade unions. On the contrary, they will be cheering on the militants, justying all their industrial vandalism and bullying.And, as the climate of appeasement spreads, the dominance of the unions will tighten.The RMT will be at the forefront of the chaos, not least because its General Secretary Mick Cash – who is on a fat cat package of £,-a-year – shares Corbyn’s hard left outlook.Cash recently praised the Labour leader for “the socialist advances that have been made in the party.”This month’s RMT strike gives a disturbing glimpse into dark future that awaits Britain under Corbyn.Behind all its empty rhetoric about concern for the public, the union’s justication for imposing gridlock is as baseless as it is cruel.Contrary to the RMT’s scare-mongering, driver-only operated trains are safer and have a lower record of assaults. That reality was reinforced by a study in  by the Independent Rail Safety and Standards Board, which gave them a clean bill of health.Moreover, the union cannot pretend that rail staff are badly treated.Most of them enjoy far better conditions, holidays, job security, and pensions than their counterparts outside the public services. Like Corbyn’s Labour, the RMT has lost the plot. For the sake of our country, Mick Cash and his fellow unions barons should not be allowed any more power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Clearly it takes courage to stand before an audience charged with being funny enough to quieten the clink of cutlery.But let’s be frank. He is simply another BBC comedian with acceptable views.BBC-approved comedians dominate the maintained sector of British comedy.Auntie is the superpower of sponsored satire, scattering municence in the direction of any up-and-coming talent with a neat line in attacking approved targets: The patriarchy, Brexit, Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Tories, country-sports enthusiasts, royalists and Priti Patel. You get the picture.Of course, not all comedians rely on such sketches. But those that don’t often pay the price.Take talented young comedian Alistair Williams, who shot to prominence off the back of a sketch in which he likened Brexit to being stuck in a Burger King you have voted to leave. His video soon went viral.But as he noted on Twitter the next day: “Because I am a comedian that supports Brexit, you can no longer find me on the comedy club circuit.”There are exceptions. Pro-Brexit comedian Geoff Norcott is gradually finding his way on to a few BBC shows.Simon Evans is a successful comic who parodies his own upper-middle class, right-of-centre viewpoint, while occasionally getting in an anti-leftist dig along the way.But compare that to the roll call of liberal-left comics who pop up on the BBC: Ed Byrne, Dara O Briain, Marcus Brigstocke, Jolyon Rubinstein, Sandi Toksvig, Mitchell and Webb, Mark Steel, Mark Thomas, Jo Brand, Andy Parsons, Russell Howard and Stewart Lee.These and others form a rolling castlist for the BBC’s many radio and TV  and sketch shows, trotting out the same takes to approving titters from audiences apparently bussed in en-masse from North London.A few weeks ago, after enduring a standard Have I Got News For You anti-Brexit fest, I turned over to watch Mock The Week on BBC to see host Dara O Briain tell a list of Malaysian heritage he wouldn’t be welcome in the Brexit Party .I vented about it on Twitter because whatever you think of the Brexit Party, it has been notably erse since its inception. O Briain’s lazy smear made no sense.It quickly transpired the one Malaysian-born person to achieve senior elected office in the UK is Christina Jordan, who is the Brexit Party’s MEP for Gibraltar and the South West.Soon she was giving O Briain an ear-bashing.His retort was that he got a laugh from the studio audience because that was what they thought of the Brexit Party.No wonder, eh Even some of those on the BBC’s roster have clocked that their unormity of outlook might be a problem.Brigstocke spoke in  of the shock of seeing audience members walk out of his show during his anti-Brexit segment when he took it on tour round the country.But comedy as a whole shows few signs of coming to terms with the case for more erse thinking.Most of us not on the Left do not close our minds to the possibility of those we disagree with still being funny.The late Jeremy Hardy’s Tory takedowns on Radio ’s The News Quiz were brilliant.But most comics don’t work hard enough to offer such original material.Jo Brand’s joke about battery acid being thrown over politicians is a case in point.We get she probably doesn’t really wish that on anyone. It is another way for her to say she doesn’t like particular politicians.We knew that.Thankfully, salvation is at hand.An independent sector is sprouting up, taking advantage of social media and hosting free-thinking comedy nights.Lee Hurst, a veteran whose broadcast career was curtailed for not being reliably left-wing, is a patron of the scene.In performers such as Williams, Norcott, Evans and Titania McGrath satirist Andrew Doyle — plus free-wheeling left-wingers such as Francesca Martinez and American Rob Delaney — we see the makings of a new alternative-comedy scene.Seek them out, ditch the BBC and have a laugh.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet too many MPs have forgotten they promised to abide by the people’s decision.They spent three years trying to frustrate the result. Now they want to waste the next five doing the same.Every time one of the ultra-Remainers’ spurious claims is defeated, they invent another.They said Boris could not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement and Brussels would not budge. Boris stood his ground and proved them wrong.Now they say we will face a new clf-edge No Deal at the end of next year unless a trade deal is completed with the EU.But there is no comparison with what faced us before. We will have left the EU by then.Two big concerns — citizens’ rights and Northern Ireland — will have been dealt with.It is true that time will be tight. For that we can blame the MPs who did everything in their power to delay our exit.But Boris has proved he is an effective negotiator. Both sides want a trade deal and our economies are already aligned, making agreement easier.With a working majority, Boris’s hand will be stronger and the job will be done. Ultra-Remainers have conjured up this new No Deal spectre because they are desperate.They know thatBoris wins the General Election, we will leave the EU by the end of January and the game will be up.Their second referendum campaign is in tatters and the Liberal Democrats’ pledge to revoke Brexit has bombed.The clock is counting down to an election that could settle the issue once and for all. So they are resorting to ever-more ludicrous claims.So-called moderates should be ashamed of the insults they are hurling at Boris.It is absurd to call his agenda “far-right” or “extreme”.This language should be reserved to describe hateful movements such as the BNP or the National Front.It should not be casually thrown around by fools who have been so blinded by their hatred of Brexit they have lost all sense of proportion.Boris was a successful Mayor of London who won a second term and delivered for the public.His plans to boost funding for schools and the NHS, for more police and to increase the National Living Wage, are clearly mainstream.When Boris calls for tougher sentences for violent criminals, he is speaking squarely for the millions of quiet Brits who share these views.They hate being branded as extremists by metropolitan elitists who have lost touch with everyday concerns.Liberal Conservatives like me are entirely comfortable supporting today’s party.I have marched alongside Boris for gay rights. I have heard him speak passionately about protecting the environment. I have walked down streets and seen him connect with people like no other politician can.I cannot understand how anyone who previously called themselves a Conservative could bring themselves to urge people to vote against the party at this election.That is tantamount to saying Jeremy Corbyn should be PM.These Tory turncoats justy themselves by claiming Brexit will damage the economy. But the public rejected that argument when they voted for Brexit.And you can’t warn about jobs and investment while being willing to allow the catastrophic impact of a government led by Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.Never in my letime have I seen an agenda like Labour’s today: Ruinous nationalisation spending pledges the country cannot begin to pay for theof crushing union power a leader who has consistently sided with our country’s enemies and who refuses to tackle endemic racism in his own party.This isn’t the loony left. It is the lethal left.It is a blood-red recipe to crash the economy, impoverish our public services and relegate Britain to a third-rate power.No moderate should even consider supporting it. One by one, former Labour MPs are calling out Corbyn, warning us of the dangers.Why can’t the ultra-Remainer former Tory MPs and muddled old warhorses like Lord Heseltine, who once understood the threat of socialism, see it Blinded by their hatred of Brexit, they say the election offers a Hobson’s choice between two extremes.That is hogwash.

The Unison analysis, from freedom of information requests to  councils, reveals that  children’s centres and  youth centres have been closed since . More than a fth of public toilets, , have been shut, while council-subsidised bus routes have fallen by almost a third - a reduction of , services, many in isolated rural services. More than one in five libraries have either closed, been privatised or are now staffed by volunteers - a decrease of  council-run libraries.Unison boss Dave Prentis said public services had been “torn apart” by Tory austerity and warned it would continueBoris Johnson wins power.He said the Tories could not be trusted to deliver on their promises for public services - especially the NHS. He added: “The Tories are saying they’re not going to increase borrowing, they’re not going to increase taxation, but we’re going to move to a land of milk and honey. “It’s a pipe dream. Our public services have been neglected to such an extent that it’s going to take ten years at least to get them back up to where they were in . “Every Tory administration there’s been cut-backs in NHS real spending. There is no reason to believe that they have changed their coat.” Central government cuts have led to a % fall in council spending on local services in England since . Grant funding for councils in England has fallen by £billion and there have also been signicant cuts for councils in Wales and Scotland. Mr Prentis predicted that many Labour supporters, even those who voted Leave, would be voting on the basis of issues other than Brexit .He claimed there had been a “massive push-down” on working standards with , decent jobs gone as a result of austerity. “They’ve gone through reorganisations, privatisation, redundancies, they see decent work going off a clf and they worry about their families,” he said. He dismissed the Tories’ response to the problems facing the NHS, schools, social care and the police which have been starved of cash. “They thinkthey wear an NHS badge they can solve all the problems of the NHS when the reality is a lot dferent to that,” he said. “They’re into glib answers that can’t stand the test of time. It will take money. This cannot be done on the cheap.”  He rubbished the Tory leader’s ‘Get Brexit Done’ slogan, saying it was “a con” to suggest a trade deal could be completed by December . He warned that US multinationals were already “waiting in the wings” to take over delivery of health, local government and care services. “The American negotiators are very powerful, it’s what they insist on it’s not what we say no to,” he said.“We know from all of the trade agreements there has always been the demand for opening up public services across the board to competition”. The Unison general secretary, who wanted Labour to unequivocally back Remain in a confirmatory vote, said he still believed Brexit would damage jobs and public services. “We don’t believe that any deal that can be reached can be in the interests of the public services or workers in this country,” he said. But he believes his members don’t believe “we should be coming out heavily on Brexit”. He added: “They can see the sense in a second referendum because it’s democracy at work.” The general secretary said he would not be “instructing” his union’s .m members how to vote.

It comes after Johnson failed to agree to a grilling from rottweiler Andrew Neil, despite the giving “clear understanding that Boris Johnson had agreed the same terms” as they did when Jeremy Corbyn appeared on the same programme.Mr Gwynne also pointed claimed the corporationaposs election coverage to date had “demonstrated a worrying failure to meet the BBC’s obligations to fairness and impartiality” and demanded that this “unfairness is urgently corrected”. A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC will continue to make its own independent \" href\"http:\" rel\"nofollow\"editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.“ Hereaposs Labouraposs letter of complaint to the BBC in full. Dear Tony, I am writing to raise the Labour Party’s serious concerns over the BBC’s coverage of the General Election campaign, which we believe has repeatedly shown bias in its reporting of the Labour Party and its leadership, and demonstrated a worrying failure to meet the BBC’s obligations to fairness and impartiality. That bias has been reflected in the framing, content and balance of BBC reporting during the campaign. We have recorded numerous examples of more negative treatment, harsher scrutiny and slanted editorial comment about Labour’s leadership, policies and record, as compared with those of the Conservative Party, and submitted them to the BBC. Up to this point, there has been no substantive response, even though the time to address the evidence of bias is fast running out. In terms of balance and fairness, we have particular concerns over the Andrew Neil interviews. It now appears that the BBC has accepted the Conservative breach of the debates programmes package, agreed with both parties, and allowed the Conservative leader to choose an alternative interviewer.   Despite our concerns about Andrew Neil’s well-known conservative political leanings, we agreed to Jeremy Corbyn’s participation on the clear understanding that Boris Johnson had agreed the same terms: namely, a four-programme debates package, including a Neil interview, designed with legal oversight to ensure fairness, balance and impartiality across the campaign period. Instead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a  through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability.   This clearly broke the agreement the Labour Party made with the BBC in good faith. But despite raising this repeatedly with BBC editorial management, no proposal has been made to redress the imbalance that has been created. This imbalance is compounded almost daily by the fact that a signicant amount of BBC content – on TV, radio and online, including bulletins, commentary and newspaper reviews – draws on the content and political agenda of the Conservative Party-supporting press. The BBC does not have a role as a protagonist in the General Election. If the Conservatives are allowed to ‘play’ or manipulate the BBC, and this behaviour goes unchecked, then the corporation will have effectively been complicit in giving the Conservative Party an unfair electoral advantage."},{"url":null,"title":"what jeremy corbyn instead watching","story":"NewsWhat Jeremy Corbyn does instead of watching the Queens Christmas speechThe Labour Party leader isnt the only one who doesnt sit down to watch the Queens Christmas message on BBC One with just . million people tuning in last yearShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video corbyn-i-doesnt-watch-tv-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics what-jeremy-corbyn-instead-watching-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

What has been largely overlooked is that in the same ITV interview where he stumbled over watching Lizzieaposs speech, he also talked about helping out at homeless shelters. Mr Corbyn said: I enjoy the presence of my family and friends around Christmas. Obviously, like everybody  does. And, I also visit the homeless shelter, either on Christmas Day, or the day before, to talk to, and listen to peopleaposs lives, about how they could be made better with a government that cared for them.” The much-talked about exchange saw Corbyn asked by interviewer Julie Etchingham: Do you sit down to watch the Queenaposs speech ” Mr Corbyn replied: Itaposs on the morning, usually we have it on.” Ms Etchingham: “It’s not on in the morning. It’s at three o’clock in the afternoon. “So you donapost sit down as a family to watch the Queen’s speech   The  Labour  leader said: “We donapost watch television very much on Christmas Day.”Last year the speech enjoyed a combined audience of . million, with . million watching it on BBC One and . million on ITV. That was down from . million in  - and the UKaposs population is  million. Labour has announced a “moral mission” to save the lives of those sleeping rough on Britain’s streets this winter. Labour ’s package of measures to end rough sleeping within five years include £m for emergency shelters in the coldest months.Their plans will be backed up by an extra £bn a year to pay for staffing and support for the homeless. Mr Corbyn blamed the Tories for being “directly responsible” for the numbers living and dying on Britain’s streets.

Barcelona-based English teacher Audrey Mash, who is believed to have been born in the UK, collapsed when her heart stopped beating after she suffered severe hypothermia during a snowstorm in northern Spain. She lost consciousness and went into cardiac arrest before being rescued and revived six hours later at Barcelona’s Vall d’Hebron Hospital. Today, hospital doctor Eduard Argudo told a press conference: “This is an exceptional case on a global scale. It is the longest cardiac arrest ever recorded in Spain.” Audrey was separated from her husband Rohan Schoeman on November  while out walking in mountains near Girona. She said: “I can’t remember anything about that weekend.” Audrey had no vital signs when she reached hospital and her kidney and lungs were not working. She was airlted off the mountain after firefighters reached the area where she had gone missing.  A special machine which performs the s of the heart and lungs helped raise her temperature to  degrees Celsius, with a defibrillator then taking over the work. Audrey was left with no brain damage, which surprised doctors given theof her cardiac arrest. The only medical problems she has been left with relate to her hypothermia damaged hands.  Doctor Argudo told the press conference: “There are practically no cases of people who have been revived after their heart has stopped for so long.” Audrey, who spent  days in hospital before being discharged, told Catalan media: “I didn’t realise my le was in danger until I was in hospital.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lily allen joins drive raise","story":"NewsLily Allen joins drive to raise thousands for mum with just p to her nameThe singer has donated to help Rachel and her son in Grimsby have a better Christmas after the desperate Grimsby mum was seen in tears on BBC NewsShareByPaige FreshwaterJoseph WilkesReporter:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video mum-breaks-down-tears-puts-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news lily-allen-joins-drive-raise-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

December th is set to be the busiest day of the year for UK pubs with  hours of sports scheduled. The aposCEOapos at Greene Kingaposs The Globe, Baker Street, will be on hand provide punters with excuses to keep their friends and family off their case to ensure they donapost miss any football fixtures or the World Heavyweight title fight between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr. CEO Edmund Short will phone partners, parents and pals with believable excuses - from punctures to flat batteries and road closures to cancelled trains - to explain why the person in question is unable to meet them at the arranged time. In a video of the CEO in action, one football fan was aposexcusedapos from dog-sitting duties after his car supposedly broke down. Another used the pop-up service to avoid babysitting for her sister for a couple of hours, on the pretext that she was stuck in traffic and her phone battery had run down. The local derby between Manchester City and Manchester United is expected to draw the biggest viewership, followed by Everton versus Cha, and Bournemouth versus Liverpool. Chris Conchie, head of sport at Greene King, said: Super Saturday is the biggest day of the year for football and with the boxing match on the same day, there is a risk that dedicated fans might be unable to catch every minute of the action. Thereaposs nothing worse than wanting to spend time in the pub but knowing youaposre on a deadline and have to leave in the middle of the match because youaposre meant to be where. Our aposCEOapos - aposChief Excuse Officerapos - will be on hand at the bar throughout Super Saturday to aid punters in need of a quick one-liner, to ensure their place in the pub is secure all day without any distractions.  It comes after a study of , Brits found  per cent have told a aposwhite lieapos in order to escape to the pub to watch a sporting fixture. One in four adults have made a deal with their partner in the past to allow them to stay in the pub to watch a game on the big screen, while more than a third have offered to do chores around the house. And one in three have been allowed out by their other half, as long as they promised to do all the washing up when ing home. When put on the spot by a needy partner or pal trying to pry them from the pub,  per cent are most likely to say they bumped into an old friend and are unable to come home. Other popular excuses include apossomeoneaposs just offered a free roundapos, aposI owe my friend a drinkapos and aposmy friend just got dumped and I need to comfort themapos.  More than two thirds of those surveyed by OnePoll named the pub as one of their favourite venues to watch a sporting event. Around  per cent put this down to their local having a better atmosphere than their living room, while  per cent enjoy the game more with a pint in their hand. Half of those polled even use a match at the pub as an excuse to catch up with mates and  per cent said the pub has a better TV set-up for watching the match than they do at home. Chris Conchie added: This Super Saturday, Greene King pubs expect to pour around , pints to sporting fans both during the day and into the evening.  More than  Greene King pubs will be showing the footballing fixtures and Anthony Joshua vs Andy Ruiz Jr match. TOP  EXCUSES USED TO STAY IN THE PUB . You bumped into an old friend .

Now the -year-old has revealed how devastating depression led to her being passed from pillar to post, struggling to feed her son and left at the mercy of the brutal Universal Credit system. Rachel said: My depression got really bad and I wasnapost getting the help I needed. I didnapost get out of the house for three months. I just sat in my bedroom and it just escalated.  Thereaposs a lack of support, getting a doctoraposs appointment was dficult. You just get passed from pillar to post, from council to crisis team, to doctor.  And that gets you even more depressed. You keep telling people your situation and repeating yourself, and getting nowhere. Are you a struggling parent   Email webnews@mirror with your story Rachel is from Grimsby, where one in four residents are on low incomes and one in two children grow up in poverty. Universal Credit, which was introduced in  by the Tories, has made it a lot harder, Rachel says. She said: They should never have brought it in, itaposs the worst thing they did. Thereaposs that many people struggling on it. You are getting paid once a month,something happens in the middle of the month, you are in trouble. Itaposs harder to budget.    When it was fortnightly, you didnapost struggle so much or worry so much, you can budget for two weeks at a push, but not monthly. In another cruel blow, Rachel is being punished for missing a job seekeraposs appointment which she was unaware of as she does not have a phone or an internet connection. This led to her Universal Credit being sanctioned and a large amount being taken from her payment. This is why, when the television cameras came to her temporary home, she only had p to her name after enduring a particularly hard month. Iaposm struggling with myself, Rachel says. I cry a lot, mainly when Iaposm on my own. But Iaposm getting there, Iaposve got a lot to focus on, I just donapost have the energy to do it. Her son Bradley is  this month and Rachel says heaposs the only thing keeping her going, the only thing she has to live for. As long as my son is eating, I can manage, she says. Heaposs a growing boy, heaposs at college four days a week so my main priority is making sure heaposs fed, heaposs happy - and looking for a permanent house.But with her next Universal Credit payment coming just five days before Christmas - on the th - she hasnapost yet been able to buy her son a Christmas card yet, which she said hurts but itaposs good that heaposs old enough to understand. Rachel says she sees a lot more people struggling now, compared to five or  years ago.  Everyone says they canapost help you, so they pass you on to everybody , said Rachel.  Sometimes it feels like you donapost have a voice. Youaposre on Universal Credit so you dont have a voice, or youaposre homeless so you donapost have a voice.  Weaposre still human beings at the end of the day. Since Rachelaposs plight was highlighted in the Mirror, Grimsby Live and the BBC, people have come forward with offers of help for the desperate mum.One person has even offered to provide her with a place to stay other than the homeless accommodation she finds herself and her son in. Rachel said: Iaposm a bit overwhelmed, itaposs amazing. Itaposs blown me away how many people want to help. But I didnapost do this for that, I just wanted to get it out there I didnapost expect any of it. It was just to make people aware of how bad it is in Grimsby. Itaposs not just about myself.  Pam Hodge runs the The Rock Foundation Food Bank, based in the former Holme Hill School, and said you can make a donation to the foodbank and state that it is for Rachel. Sheaposs going to need everything for the home such as furniture, a cooker, a bed, electrical appliances - you name it, she said. If they give her money it could affect her benefits. Sheaposs been overwhelmed by the generosity and is keen for it go to help other people as well. People have been very generous, and itaposs raising awareness of whataposs going on in Grimsby, Rachel is just one of many. If you make a donation to the foodbank then everyone can have a good Christmas.  Pam said Grimsby is a very deprived area with fourth or fth generation unemployment. A once thriving fishing industry is all but gone, and the town is starved of big developments and tends to be forgotten.Weaposve been forgotten about for many years, Rachel says. But with Universal Credit itaposs made it even more dficult. People are struggling to budget for even a week.People who are are in debt are finding the authorities can take % straight from your Universal Credit when you get it.  Itaposs sheer desperation. Pam said in November last year roughly  people come into the foodbank. This November it was ,. She said: Itaposs a lot to do with Universal Credit. There is a lack of employment. The North gets ignored.  Pam started the charity  years ago and the foodbank five years after that.   years ago you would have never thought weaposd need a foodbank, but thereaposs a clear need for it, she said.  We are on our toes all the time trying to get enough foot to feed people.  And Pam says she doesnapost see things getting any better.   If something doesnapost happen, where are going to be in five years time Pam said Bradley, Rachelaposs son, has his birthday just after Christmas and, like any other lad, there is one thing he desperately wants - a bike so he can ride around with his mates.

Tory Ojeda lives with three of her partners in Jacksonville, Florida, and despite being in an open relationship sheaposs the only one who has multiple partners. Seven months ago, Tory found out that she was pregnant with a baby girl who they will welcome into their unconventional family in February. She met one of her partners Marc, , in high school and then got into a relationship with Travis, , two months later. Their love story began three years ago and she has since announced her engagement to Travis in July. Then she also found love in their long-term mutual friend Ethan, , and Christopher, , who is the babyaposs father. She said: “Chris is the biological father. We just know that because of timing and when the approximate conception date was. “Based off of the approximate conception day, we had been on vacation. So it was only us. “But as far as I guess, socially goes, weaposre all raising the baby together, so everyoneaposs dad. “We’re all very, very excited to be raising a baby together.”  Tory says that her boyfriends are “welcome” to pursue other peoplethey wish to - she even encourages the idea. She told Barcroft TV: “Honestly, I would love itsomebody found a second partner. “Dividing time and figuring out schedules between all five people and making sure everyone feels included, it’s kind of dficult. “I’d like to not be the only woman in the relationship. That would definitely be nice.” They all have their own bedrooms but her partners “swap in and out” of her bed each night, making sure each of them gets an “equal turn” in spending the night with Tory.  On the issue of jealousy, Ethan said: “There are a couple of healthy ways to deal with it. Primarily just talking to each other.” She added: “Thereaposs always going to be like little moments of jealousy, it does take a certain amount of restraint and just getting relaxed. I will say it helpsyou know the person.” Reflecting on his own experiences in his current relationship, he said: “Seeing [Tory] with Ethan was a lot easier because I was friends with him. “Her and Chris was a bit dicier at first, there was a lot more jealousy and Iaposll openly admit that. The same goes for Marc because Iaposd never interacted with them.” When asked how he feels about sharing the responsibilities of being a father, Christopher said: “It’s definitely a little interesting.  “I grew up with the idea of you know, one dad, one mum. But there is a lot of support between all of us dads and it’s something we can tag team. “We always joke about the idea of getting stack in an endless loop of go ask your dad.” Despite their enthusiasm to raise a child as a five, some members of their respective families are yet to come around to their relationship and to the pregnancy news.  Tory said: “Most of my friends know all my partners and they love us and think that we’re cute and such. My family is kind of quiet about their disapproval. “Polyamory is definitely an uncommon thing.  “A lot of people have grown up in monogamy culture of, you donapost really love someoneyou have eyes for somebody .” Christopher added: “My family is slowly coming around to the idea. The pregnancy has helped with that. But at the very beginning, I know my mother and father were hesitant about it. “Her main concern was that she didnapost like the idea of me having a partner who was not fulfilled with me alone.” However Ethan’s family are “very active” in their support, along with Tory’s older brother, Alistair. Alistair said: “I will admit that since Iaposm her older brother, that I just have that tendency I suppose to be protective.  “Iaposm more so concerned that sheaposs happy, that she is in a relationship where they both love each other mutually or in this case more people love each other mutually. “I don’t see anything wrong with Tory’s relationship.” After having to overcome judgement in public spaces, Tory hopes that she will eventually see more acceptance of polyamory in wider society. “We definitely get weird looks,” she said. “I’ve had people just say rude comments when weaposve just been hanging out at a fast food place.

Between them, the pair have now had six birthday cards from the Queen. They each got one for their th birthdays and Win has had one a year since she was . The collection is set to grow next month, when Win will be . Originally from Pillgwenlly in Newport, South Wales, the sisters were born performers and grew up to star at Newport’s Empire Theatre. Lil, who said she had a “pitch-perfect voice at the age of two”, sang, tap danced and played the accordion. Win was part of a dance troupe and known as “the highest kicker in Wales”. Lil said: “I was fortunate to have a pitch- perfect voice at the age of two. It was like Katherine Jenkins’ but just not trained.” At the outbreak of the Second World War in , Lil and Win’s six brothers went off to join in the Navy. Lil volunteered to be a bus conductor, the first female one in Wales. She said: “Conductresses were needed during the war because of the blackout. “There were a lot of Irish boys working here who didn’t know where they were going. “We had a small lamp on our front which was the only light inside the bus. “It was so dark that you had to call out every stop, whether you could see it or not. “But we used to have a laugh on the last bus, singing songs with the boys on their way home from the pub.” After the war, Lil married and moved to South Africa with her husband Donald, a deputy post master. Like Lil, Donald also loved entertaining and the couple travelled the country performing for charities. When they ed to Wales, Lil took a three-month caretaker job in charge of the Bridge Inn, near Usk, Monmouthshire, which turned into a -year stay. She said she was the only publican in the area who would welcome blind people, as others turned them away for fear they would spill their drinks. It was only when she was well into her s that Lil stopped singing. But even now, a resident in the Willowbrook assisted living home in Bettws, Newport, she still loves to dance. Despite having had arthritis for the past few years, Lil said she had not let that get in the way of enjoying her le and doing as much as she can.And there has been plenty of new experiences over the past century.

Maksim Yakubets is said to run the group Evil Corp, which used computer viruses to cheat UK victims out of hundreds of millions of poinds. The -year-oldaposs lavish lestyle was revealed at a press conference in Washington DC, in the US, where he has been over two international computer hacking and bank fraud schemes. National Crime Agency  director Rob Jones described how Yakubets led a flamboyant, extravagant and lavish lestyle which was cash rich with fast cars and said to have been funded by stealing from victims. Amongst his vehicles is a customised Lamborghini supercar with a personalised number plate that translates to Thief and spent over a quarter of a million pounds on his wedding, the NCA said. The NCA, politan Police and the National Cyber Security Centre worked alongside the US Justice Department and FBI on the long-running investigation into Evil Corp which is described as representing the most signicant cyber crime threat to the UK. The group targeted the UK for almost a decade with several types of malware which would intercept bank transfers from members of the public and businesses, the NCA said. The nature of the software means some people will never know they have been infected or the cause of the lost money. Yakubets, accused of having links to Russian security service the FSB and of operating online under the name Aqua, is said to have employed dozens of people to run his operation from the basements of Moscow cafes.  If he ever leaves Russia, he will be arrested and extradited to the US to face charges and a series of financial sanctions have been imposed by the US Treasury. The announcement comes after the NCA and Met previously targeted a network of money launderers with which he is accused of having links who had funnelled profits back to Evil Corp. So far eight people have been convicted and are serving  years in prison between them. Yakubets is on the FBIaposs most-wanted cyber criminals list and is now subject to a five million US dollars US State Department reward - the largest ever reward offered for this type of offender.  A statement from the US Treasury Department said: Yakubets also provides direct assistance to the Russian governmentaposs malicious cyber efforts, highlighting the Russian governmentaposs enlistment of cyber criminals for its own malicious purposes. Fellow Russian Igor Turashev, , is accused of being Yakubetsapos administrator and has also been indicted for cyber crime offences.  Mr Jones accused the pair of being two of the most prolic cyber criminals in the world and said the case was a landmark in history for the NCA in which a trail of breadcrumbs was painstakingly followed over nine years. They are believed to have targeted thousands of victims and  organisations in  dferent countries. Financial malware is commonly installed through emails that contain infected attachments.The downloaded malware then remains hidden on a victimaposs computer to gather private and personal data, which is subsequently exploited to steal money and enable fraud. Assistant US attorney general Brian Benczkowski said: Maksim Yakubets allegedly has engaged in a decade-long cybercrime spree that deployed two of the most damaging pieces of financial malware. The malware known as Bugat or Dridex was designed to steal theft of confidential personal and financial information, such as online banking details, from infected computers.

We had managed to stay hopeful and positive for a few hours but it was horrendous and we were on the point of giving up when Gavin saw a light.“To begin with I thought he was seeing things but then I saw it too, although it kept appearing and disappearing.“We barely had any strength left but I just kept blowing desperately on a whistle. The guys on board could hear us but not see us.“They got to us just in time. Gavin was going under. They grabbed us and hauled us on board.”Seven years on and Benny is now a key member of the Broughty Ferry leboat crew, serving with coxswain Murray Brown, one of the men involved in his rescue. vw, px\"  The camaraderie between Benny and Murray is clear to see, with the banter flowing between the two, but Benny is in no doubt as to just what Murray and the other members of the leboat crews did that day.They gave him his le back and allowed him to go back to his we and children.Following his rescue, Benny decided to thank everyone involved in the best way he knew how – he became one of them.The following February, Benny went along to the Broughty crew’s open day.“I kept in regular touch with them after that and kept going along to see them. Eventually I asked to join them,” he said.“The rescue changed my entire le. I left my offshore job and became a fireman in Fe and moved to Broughty Ferry with my family.”Benny has been involved in many shouts himself now.He said: “One I found particularly hard to deal with was an -year-old girl who had fallen from the Tay Bridge. vw, px\"  “She was so young I was really affected. We got her on to the boat and I stayed with her on the way back to the station. She told me about her le“What she told me that day will always stay with me.“I’m glad I was part of the team that managed to save her le that day.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/5de8fae99cb164.30451460-448x564.jpg ","title":"dee must handle setbacks better","story":"Dundee can’t afford to feel sorry for themselves as they struggle for form in the Championship ahead of Saturday’s trip to face Arbroath.That’s the opinion of manager James McPake as he called on his experienced players to ensure his team can put out a much-improved performance this weekend at Gayfield.The Dens gaffer pointed to the lack of response from his side after conceding the opening goal in Saturday’s - defeat to Queen of the South and has challenged his players to do better.He said: “Of course, goals do change games and particularly when you are at home on the back of two defeats.“People do look too much into conceding the first goal.“You can concede at any time and by no means should it be a defining moment in any game –you say the first goal is so important thenyou concede you basically are saying the game is over.“I thought we recovered a wee bit but it wasn’t great.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

If you do hit a deer, report it to the police, evenyou are uninjured and your car is not damaged, as the deer may be fatally injured and suffering.Jamie Hammond, SNH management officer."},{"url":null,"title":"stars rough start continues with defeat to league leaders","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star are still looking for their first points in this season#s Premier One campaign after another disastrous first half saw the Lochgilphead side trail - at half time against table-topping Easthall at the Ropework.The home side steadied the ship in the second half, however, and pulled a consolation goal back through a well placed effort from Lee MacLean # though the damage had been done in a first-half spell where Star shipped five goals in the space of half an hour.On Saturday November , Red Star travel to play Argyll neighbours Dunoon AFC looking to pick up their first win and move themselves off the foot of the table."},{"url":null,"title":"tree shop branches out for christmas craft fair","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Tree Shop at Clachan, Cairndow, is usually buzzing with customers.If not searching for plants, shrubs and trees for the garden they might be looking for that perfect present in the gt shop or enjoying a cake and a cuppa in the tearoom.The annual pre-Christmas craft fair at the Tree Shop saw plenty more people descend on the popular centre, situated beside the A at the head of Loch Fyne.On a gorgeous but chilly autumn day, Tree Shop manager Neil Colburn said: #It#s been really busy, which is great.

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually. There is a lot of work going on, but I think we can do more.The next general elections hustings are set to take place on Monday.At .am, BBC Scotland will host a hustings at Heart of Hawick, while in the evening a second hustings, organised by Selkirk Community Council, will take place at Victoria Halls, Selkirk, at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"musical-instruments-ready-collect-peebles-high","story":"MUSICAL instruments left behind after last weeks fire are now ready to collect.All instruments have been collected from Peebles High School after the fire which has forced the High School to close until after Christmas.The instruments have been transported to Priorsford Primary School and will be available until pm today .Scottish Borders Council are making arrangements for further opportunities to collect belongings and instruments tomorrow , details of which will be released in due course.For all updates on the fire, visithttps:www.scotborders.gov.uk PHSfireHave you been impacted by the fire  Get in touch.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him.

You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"holding-politicians-account-duty-not-bore","story":"Tuesday nightrsquos encounter was not an exact replacement for Kylersquos late and unlamented three ring circus.

Scotlandrsquos educational performance, on which the country has always prided itself ndash rightly or wrongly ndash was revealed to be a dangerously leaning tower. Reading levels were up, but performances in maths and science were falling and at record lows. Lindsay Paterson, professor of education policy at Edinburgh University, described Scotlandrsquos overall performance as ldquostagnating in mediocrity.As well as being taken to task on education, the subject on which she has asked to be judged first and foremost, the First Minister was asked about the state of Scotlandrsquos hospitals.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"description\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media iFShJ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests iFShJ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": This was not the first time she had been tackled on the subject on television. There was Andrew Neilrsquos now famous question to her on November  in his BBC show.After stating that only two of eight waiting time targets had been hit, Neil went on: ldquoChildren are dying in a new Glasgow hospital because the water is contaminated, perhaps by pigeon droppings. A new multi-million pound Edinburgh hospital, should have opened in , is still unfit to open. You canrsquot even get the ventilation system to work. Yoursquove got the worst drug addiction problem in Europe but you cut drug treatment budgets by pound million. You clung on to your last health minister, you are under pressure to sack her successor. Yoursquove called for legislation to protect the NHS from Donald Trump. Maybe the NHS needs legislation to protect it from Nicola Sturgeon : Sturgeon acccuses think-tank on analysisIt was a blistering inquiry. To be fair to Ms Sturgeon, she had responses for both Neil last week and her interrogators on Tuesday. To Neil, she pointed out, among other things, the pound million being put into meeting waiting time targets, the public inquiry into the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and the ldquoextremely high public satisfaction ratings for the NHS in Scotland. In the STV debate she highlighted the improvement in reading.The question here is not how she performed in both instances. She is an impressive politician, on the national and international stage. But why does it take a General Election for her to be challenged so robustly  Why are there not more such encounters For all Andrew Neilrsquos talents, he did not fall out of a magic interviewer tree. He is smart, fast, has a certain dogged style and command of facts and puts them to good use. Similarly, there was nothing radically dferent about the STV debate, other than the participants were allowed to cross examine each other, an innovation all other televised debates should adopt.There is no doubt that the First Minister regularly puts her record forward for scrutiny. She does it every week at FMQs for starters. It should be noted, too, that like the other party leaders, but not Boris Johnson, she went into the Neil den. He has been frit she was not. Over the past few weeks she has appeared in countless debates and phone-ins.Yet as far as television grillings go, it is only in the Neil interview and the STV debate that she has been robustly held to account.Granted, the notion that Scotlandrsquos First Minister is somehow given an easy ride will be laughable to some. Of the near dozen national daily newspapers in Scotland only one, our sister paper The National, openly backs independence and, by implication, the main party supporting it.Of the rest, as any visit to the newsagents will show, no-one would suspect them of being cheerleaders for the FM, and some are ferocious in their criticism.As for the BBC in Scotland, it comes under frequent attack for alleged bias, a charge it denies.This is not solely about the media, however. It is about a political culture that has become too settled and not questioning enough.In part the failure to hold the FM and her Ministers to account can be put down to the calibre of opposition politicians. A fair number, not all, are simply not good enough. Nor is the Scottish Parliament always sitting when problems arise.: Candidate leaflet defacedI do not believe that the First Minister is given an easier time of it because she is a woman. If anything, the opposite is true.The trouble goes wider than any branch of the media, or inidual politician. A few months ago there was a dust up on Twitter between Muriel Gray and Val McDermid. The row flared over a tweet by the BBCrsquos political editor Laura Kuenssberg and whether or not it showed bias against the FM. Ms McDermid said: ldquoI used to respect you @bbclaurak. Insulting a politician for doing their job, however, reduces that respect to shreds.To which Ms Gray replied: ldquoMocking politicians of all and every party instead of beatying them used to be the norm in Scotland. We were rather good at it. The bedrock of Scots humour. Not sure I even recognise this lsquoworship the great leader or rsquo thing. Itrsquos so not ...Scottish. And so it went on.Did Gray have a point  Is there enough distance in Scotland between the government and the governed, or after so long with one party in power has the situation become cosier than is good for us Every government makes mistakes. All governments can do better. There have to be ways of pointing that out that donrsquot meet with accusations of bias or unfairness.

Stuart McWilliam, of Global Witness, said: ldquoThese new statistics frankly make a mockery of claims that the UK is a leader in the fight against climate change. Successive UK Governments have not only ignored the role of oil and gas, but ensured we are expanding its production.ldquoThis is simply not compatible with the Paris climate goals to avoid irreversible climate breakdown.ldquoA year from now whoever wins the General Election will hold the presidency of the UNrsquos vital Conference of the Parties climate summit. If the UK is really to lead the world in the battle against climate change, the next Government will need to abandon these expansion plans and instead announce the start of a planned phase-out of fossil fuels.ldquoWe are facing a climate emergency ndash our planet and our country canrsquot afford more dither and delay, otherwise the battle to save the planet could be lost.Worldwide, over the next five years, the oil and gas sector has plans to invest .tn in new fields and methods of extraction.Critics say this would lock companies and countries on a path that will guarantee  gigatonnes of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions, the equivalent of building , new coal-fired power stations.America and Canada are responsible for  per cent of the potential expansion in production, followed by Argentina, Chile, Norway, Australia, Mexico and the UK. Tzeporah Berman, international campaign director at US-based charity Stand.Earth, said: ldquoIf your house is on fire, you donrsquot add more fuel. ldquoNo one is saying turn off the taps overnight. We still use oil and gas today, but we must act now to stop the planned expansion by the oil and gas industry that could lock us into an unsafe climate.Global Witness is calling on the UK Government to phase out all subsidies and tax breaks for oil and gas expansion, legislate to ensure extraction is compatible with the . degree limit to warming agreed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and to stop issuing licences for new oil and gas exploration.It also wants to see the repeal of measures in the UKrsquos  Infrastructure Act, which calls on governments to ldquomaximise economic recovery of oil and gas, effectively binding successive administrations to ensure as much oil and gas as possible is extracted."},{"url":null,"title":"sand-dune-plan-prove-explosive-wildlife","story":"But now the vast site of the British Dynamite Factory in Ardeer, Ayrshire, has become home to hundreds of important birds, bugs and other species that campaigners say must be protected by preventing development in the area.The Ardeer peninsula has been described by the Scottish Wildle Trustas ldquoone of the richest areas for wildle in Scotland.Home to one of the largest sand dune systems in south Scotland, it is under threat, however, by proposals to develop the complex habitats.In recent years about  hectares of dunes have been destroyed through commercial sand extraction within five extraction sites.This is due to a Special Development Order dating to  that means development can take place in large swathes of the peninsula without the detailed planning permission that would be required where in Scotland.However, Scottish Wildle Trust, Bugle Scotland, Butterfly Conservation Scotland and RSPB Scotland are now calling on North Ayrshire Council to ensure the entire site is safeguarded from inappropriate development.In a letter to the council, the conservation charities highlight the importance of the Ardeer peninsularsquos natural environment, and ask for a Strategic Environmental Assessmentto be carried out ahead of proposedlarge-scale development on the peninsula.This process would highlight any potential negative impacts that new-build developments and increased public access could have on Ardeerrsquos natural environment.A Memorandum of Understanding signed by North Ayrshire Council and NPL Group earlier this year lists a number of potential developments on the Ardeer peninsula, which could be funded through the Ayrshire Growth Deal.These include a new road bridge linking Ardeer to Irvine, large leisure and tourism developments, and houses. The agreement also proposes repairing the footbridge that crosses the harbour.The charities argue that, without careful planning, these developments could damage fragile habitats andlead to increased disturbance to sensitive wildle.Disappointingly, they say, the Memorandum of Understanding makes no mention of Ardeerrsquos important natural heritage, or the need to protect its important bioersity.Bruce Wilson, public affairs manager for the Scottish Wildle Trust, said: ldquoArdeer is home to an impressive range of wildle that should be celebrated and protected for future generations.ldquoSadly, the plans that have been outlined give no indication that its natural importance is even recognised.ldquoIt is vital the natural environment is taken into account within any plans for development on Ardeer.Naturalists have recorded more than , species, including birds, mammals, plants and insects on the peninsula, supported by a iety of sand dune habitats that are themselves among the most important of their kind in Scotland.Among the species recorded are  types of birds, including barn owls, hen harriers and snow buntings  mammal species, three amphibians and almost types of beetle.There are also  kinds of moths and butterflies,  spider species and  other types of insects including bees,flies and wasps, along with  species of trees and wildflowers and  fungi, lichens and bryophytes.Having already established factories in Stockholm and Hamburg, Sir Alfred Nobel turned his attentions to the potentially very lucrative market in England ndash but was met with strict safety regulations and ended up in Scotland instead.Sir Alfred took out a British patent for dynamite in May  and began a publicity campaign to convince the authorities and potential users of the safety of his new explosive. He eventually acquired  acres from the Earl of Eglinton, and established the British Dynamite Factory in .He went on to create what was described then as the largest explosives factory in the world.The sand and dunes on the site provided natural safety features for the site and its workers.Iain Hamlin, secretary of the Friends of Stevenston conservation group, said: ldquoThe southern end of Ardeer has a natural coastal environment that is unrivalled in the south of Scotland.

The energy produced is enough to power an estimated , homes, but environmentalists claim biomass energy isn’t as green as it appears.Scotlands biomass sites generate enough energy to power , homes.When people think of clean energy, wind turbines and solar  often come to mind.But biomass power plants – a less well-known method of generating renewable electricity – are booming across the UK and environmental campaigners have raised doubts about their green credentials.The burning of trees or plant matter – known as plant biomass – now accounts for more than a fth of the UK’s renewable energy, second only to wind power.The number of plant biomass power plants in the UK has more than trebled in four years, from  in  to  in .Between them, they now produce enough energy to power around . million homes, analysis by the JPIMedia Data Unit has found.In Scotland, the number has quadrupled from  biomass sites in  to  by . Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Council has said there will more recycling vehicles available to carry out collections, as of this week, after a number of recent breakdowns.

It is not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland will be appalled at this latest development.“Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.#Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston slammed the SNP and said this legal action by the government-owned CalMac will lead to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.He said: “When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway. But with the SNP in sole charge of transport for more than  years, things just keep getting worse.“This is what happens when you have a nationalist government completely distracted by the constitution.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not surprisingly, the prospect of this was enough to put some people off from coming forward in the first place.“Rape Crisis Orkney and others have rightly been highlighting the need to find ways of allowing examinations to take place. To their credit, successive Justice Ministers have responded positively since I first raised concerns with them over two years ago.#Since then, a lot of work has been carried out by ious organisations and iniduals to finding solutions that work for island communities but respect the need for equal access to services.“I, therefore, welcome the Forensic Medical Services Bill and its commitment to equal access across all health boards, including our islands.  The provision of support from the Taskforce to assist with creating and enhancing facilities to allow this to happen is also reassuring.#While some iniduals may still prefer to access services where, for a iety of reasons, what is key is that this is a matter of choice.“Hopefully, NHS Orkney working with local partners will now be able to build on the progress made to date so that we have a robust and sustainable local self-referral service in line with other parts of the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The trees that will stand inside and outside the St Magnus Cathedral are from Grimstad and Hordaland, in Norway, respectively.Speaking during an event at the Robert Rendall building in Stromness today Mr Strømmen talked about the visit to Orkney so far — which is a first for him.He said: #There are two things that really stand out when it comes to Orkney — there is the Viking tradition and the fact that Orkney was part of Norway many hundreds of years ago. That legacy, in a way, is still here.#For us, coming to Orkney is a bit like coming home and I hope people will take that in a good sense. In the way society works here, there is something we recognise instantly.

How the Scottish Government reacts is crucial.There is, it is probably fair to say, a general feeling of malaise among many members of the public about today’s political class. So it is possible that a new poll showing signicant declines in public confidence in the Scottish Government’s handling of health, education and justice partly reflects this sense of discontent.However, the seemingly endless stream of bad news about the NHS in particular also provides concrete evidence that all is not as it should be in the health service. Education Secretary John Swinney has been bullish in his defence of the SNP’s record on education, but the recent Pisa figures, which compare the education systems of dferent countries, saw -year-old pupils’ performance in maths and science hit a record low. And while reading levels had improved, they were still below those at the start of the millennium.: Scottish Police Authority chief Susan Deacon resigns with scathing attack: Poll: Half of Scots believe NHS has got worse since Nicola Sturgeon became FMThe much-troubled Scottish Police Authority appeared to have stabilised under the stewardship of former Labour minister Susan Deacon, but her decision to quit as chair demonstrates that problems remain. In her resignation letter, she condemned the “fundamentally flawed” system of holding the police service to account and suggested a “better separation between politics and policing” was necessary.To his credit, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf did not seek to undermine Deacon’s credibility, saying instead there had been “signicant improvement across many facets” of the force and that “our police service is in a much stronger place now than prior to her appointment”. So he appears to recognise she was doing a good job and perhaps suggests he thinks she has a point. If so, it is an attitude that other politicians should emulate. If our public discourse becomes nothing more than a shouting match in which all sides try to paint each other as the devil, regardless of the facts, then policy will become all about perception, rather than reality, with any criticisms dismissed as “fake news”.In such a situation, public services are bound to suffer. We need politicians who take criticisms seriously and who are big enough to accept them when they are on the mark, eventhis requires a U-turn or an embarrassing climbdown.Perception is important –the SNP loses public confidence, they could be voted out, ending their independence ambitions – but it must not become all important or the current malaise will only get worse.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland s railways is the story that keeps on giving but often not in a good way alastair dalton","story":"Train operators like ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper crave positive headlines but all too often they shoot themselves in the foot, writes Alastair Dalton.I’m normally to be found grilling transport ministers, not speaking in their honour.But I’m not sure what Sir Eric Geddes would have made of what I recently told the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport , a centenary after he became its first president - and Britain’s first transport minister.Edinburgh-born Sir Eric, who started out as a lumberjack and steelworker in the US, later became synonymous with the word “axe” for the post-war austerity measures he introduced as chairman of the Committee on National Expenditure in .But the Conservative politician and businessman, who was educated at the independent Merchiston Castle School in the capital, was first and foremost a railway man, who became deputy general manager of the North Eastern Railway, the forerunner of today’s LNER, before revolutionising transport on the western front in the First World War.:  lost and abandoned railway stations in Scotland - and what happened to them: Scotland’s least used railway station sees passenger numbers doubleIt was coincidental,appropriate, that my CILT talk was on “Scotland’s railways - the story that keeps on giving”. The rail network is a gt to journalists, like no other area of transport, and not necessarily in a good way.While there are good news stories - like falling crime rates, and lowered fences for baby deer, to give recent examples - too often the industry attracts the opposite type of coverage.Shrinking coffee cupsApart from the perennial fare rises, delays and overcrowding - the booming railways are a victim of their own success - the industry has a propensity for repeatedly shooting itself in the foot.Like Network Rail’s failure to check bridge heights, which nearly forced the cancellation of the newly-restored Flying Scotsman locomotive’s triumphantto Scotland.Or incoming ScotRail Abellio asking staff to cut its predecessor First’s logo off their unorms. Or even First’s stewardship including shrinking the size of coffee cups on trains because it couldn’t cope with demand.Discontented workers and passengers don’t hold back on leaking me the bad news - like the latest ScotRail staff survey results, or its decision to scrap seat reservations. Then there’s the seemingly never ending woes of the new Caledonian Sleeper.By contrast, those responsible for promoting the railways need to up their game because far too often the “positive” news stories I write about rail are ones I have found myself.Perhaps Sir Eric might have recognised the predicament. In his inaugural presidential address to the institute in , he described the railways as the “great predominating factor in transport”.However, he said that despite their modest rate of , they “have figured in the minds of the masses as a great, bloated capitalist organisation, an object not of sympathy but rather of suspicion and jealousy”.A century on, I don’t have such prejudices, and I don’t go out looking for bad - or good - stories about the railways, or any other forms of transport, despite what some vocal conspiracy theorists claim on social media. I’m also not looking for ways to criticise - or praise - Sir Eric’s successors as transport ministers or the governments they serve.I’m just looking for interesting stories that our readers will find compelling, unexpected oruseful. I remain keen to hear from whistleblowers when things go wrong, but I’d equally like to receive new and interesting information from those who want to champion the railways.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"some working parents simply can t make things work that must change kelly ann woodland","story":"While there has been some progress in helping working parents, it can still be tough to juggle children and a career, writes STV News at Six presenter Kelly-Ann Woodland.Returning to work after a career break is tough going. Throw a teething baby and a brand new role into the works and it’s an emotional rollercoaster. A tiring, guilt-inducing, fraught, high-speed rollercoaster of a ride that never slows down. On the one hand, you get to go to the toilet by yourself at work. On the other, there’s a good chance you have a Cheerio in your hair. Many organisations are changing rapidly to ease ing to work and there are support groups out there to build confidence and help with the military-style planning that’s needed to balance work and family le. The opportunity to front flagship news programme The STV News at Six came when I was on maternity leave with my second son. I was six months in, with my head firmly focused on my kids. But this was my dream job and one I’d worked hard for. It would mean more hectic days, considerable planning, a y commute, a live show and a race home to put the kids to bed. So, was I right to go for the job I’d wanted all my le, despite the timing  Absolutely. For me, this was about making the right choices for the kids in the long-term and setting a good example. I wanted them to see you can go for the big jobs, irrespective of obstacles.: This is how maternity and paternity leaves around Europe compare: SNP unveils ‘game-changing’ plan for  weeks ‘Daddy leave’After clinching the job, I focused my efforts on trying to achieve that much-coveted work-le balance. I had a positive conversation with STV where we agreed new hours so that I could do the nursery and school run in the morning. I’d recommend going to employers with a reasonable but flexible plan and being open to a conversation about how you can both make it work – and thankfully, STV were receptive to this.As a family, we figured out a childcare plan, with my husband adapting his schedule and taking on afternoon pickups. I spend half my commute on the phone, organising the kid’s schedules. Loads of those calls are to my mum, who I’m very thankful to say is a godsend, especially when the kids are unwell.Exhausted before hitting motorwayLike loads of parents, there are mornings when I feel exhausted before I’ve even hit the motorway. And I’m not even going to get into the scrutiny of the appearance of women on screen, especially one who’s been woken up several times in the night before going live to half a million people each night. It simply shouldn’t matter.Alongside millions of other working parents, I’ve so many balls in the air and sometimes they come crashing down. I’ve still not managed to strike that perfect balance but a flexible working policy, an understanding boss, a support network and good childcare all help enormously. I’m trying to get into mindfulness, because self care is important too.There are many working parents with way greater demands on them, and many can’t make it work. There’s still so much more progress to be made. We need increased awareness that working parents can reconnect with their working self, they haven’t lost all their skills amidst a sea of babygros and sleep deprivation and should be encouraged to have a realistic conversation with employers about what works for them.If you see a job or promotion that you think is right for you, don’t be put off by the fact you’re on maternity leave. Be bold, be brave and seize the opportunity.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates.

It was not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland would be appalled at the latest development.He said: “Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible”.Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “Procurement for the next Northern Isles ferry service contract has been hit by a number of unacceptable delays which does nothing to reassure people in the Northern Isles that the government is committed to improving our leline ferry services.“It is imperative that this dispute is resolved as soon as possible in the best interests of people in Orkney and Shetland.”Highlands and Islands Tory MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston, who lives in Orkney, also weighed in over the situation.He said: “It’s quite incredible that the SNP is being sued by oneits own quangos.“It tells you everything you need to know about the mess the SNP government has made of ferry services that a publicly owned company wants to take it to court, leading to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.“When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy. The staggering tourism data represents an almost  per cent visitor increase since  when over  million vistor trips were recorded.Fáilte Feirste Thiar Executive Director, Harry Connolly, said the record numbers were indicative of the “world class” attractions on offer in West Belfast.“Two million visitors have engaged with our established, world class visitor attractions and that includes the Coiste Political Walking Tours, Black Taxi Tours, people downloading the mural map and discovering the our murals by themselves, or visiting the new James Connolly Visitor Centre,” he said.“West Belfast also offers an urban and rural mix, where people can go to the Bog Meadows and the Belfast Hills or they can go to the city and see what our community has to offer.”He added: “The off-season in West Belfast used to be a lot longer, but that’s shortening and it shows that we are now a year-round destination.”Amongst this year’s tourism highlights were the opening of the new James Connolly Visitor Centre and the annual Féile an Phobail, which welcomed the world to West Belfast with hundreds of events including Michael Conlan’s headline bout in the Falls Park. While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects. In , we look forward to seeing the development of the Roddy McCorley Society Museum and interactive visitor’s centre. “Of course, in the early part of  we hope to see permission granted to allow Casement Park to be granted, which will be an absolute game-changer. “We see the continued growth of Féile an Phobail, we hope to have Michael Conlan back in the Falls Park to win a world title, and we look forward to the enormous event that will be.”Commenting on the latest figures, outgoing West Belfast MP and Fáilte Feirste Thiar Chairperson, Paul Maskey, said: “When you look at the numbers it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Other parts of this city are now looking at West Belfast to learn and to see what lessons they can take from it moving forward. “Fáilte Feirste Thiar is engaging with organisations in other parts of the city to help them do that.“Tourism is vitally important for our economy in West Belfast and it is sustaining many jobs in the area, and that includes restaraunts, shops, bars and clubs.”He added: “We want to increase those numbers in the time ahead, and it is our job to do that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"general election 2019 on the doorsteps with three women who have just one thing in mind winning","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I know which box to tick next Thursday.\"Her three-year-old daughter Tammy, sporting a reindeer hat, is a tad scared of the DUP canvassers and hides behind her mum.\"Im always seeing you on TV over there in England,\" Albert Bloomer tells Little-Pengelly as he pledges his support.Albert recalls polling days many decades ago when politicians toured the area asking for support from loud-hailers on the back of lorries.\"Peter Robinson has suggested I do the same, but Ive ruled it out,\" laughs the candidate.Ear-ringed pensioner Thompson Hindes is mad keen on the DUP. \"How could I not be after this good-looking girl came on the scene \" he declares, gesturing at Little-Pengelly. Thompsons we, standing right behind, doesnt mind a bit. \"It gives me a break from him,\" she jokes.Andy and Kim Ward, out walking their little dog Wicket, stop to chat to the candidate. Their big concern is the education budget. As low income parents, theyre stretched when their childrens school asks for donations to fund trips.The couple tell Little-Pengelly theyve no problem with an Irish Language Act but think it shouldnt be publicly funded.The conversation continues until the pink-collared Wicket grows impatient and strains at the leash to move on. data-dfpadtargetingAlliance’s Paula BradshawFurther up the street, the DUP MP is invited into Angelas home to warm herself on a bitterly cold afternoon. \"Poor Emma, you must be foundered,\" she says. \"Winter elections arent great,\" confesses Little-Pengelly. \"My calf muscles are sore from all the walking, even a Radox bath hasnt helped much.\" Angela sings the politicians praises for her efforts in moving her up the queue for major surgery.\"Ive just passed the -week post-op period and Emma has been in touch constantly with messages. The DUP is always there for you. With them, you feel youre not alone,\" she says.Little-Pengelly admires the cream and grey décor in Angelas immaculate living-room, her pink rug and especially her Christmas tree adorned in matching colours. \"Pale pink is very in this year,\" she remarks.\"My living room is grey and cream too, but Ive a duck egg blue rug. And you put me to shame with your beautul tree. Ive mine up, but its not decorated yet. It looks so miserable with no lights or tinsel.\"A new addition to the DUP canvassing team is William Traynor, who ran for UKIP in Mays council elections but has since joined the party. \"Its tight between Emma and the SDLPs Claire Hanna, but I really hope that we can do it,\" he says.Little-Pengelly has faced fierce criticism for becoming embroiled in arguments about UVF flags and for not building bridges in erse South Belfast, which she denies. data-dfpadtargetingAlliance’s Paula Bradshaw talks to a constituent as she canvasses in Newtownbreda\"I have reached out, thats what Im about, its who I am,\" she says. \"I held a constituency outreach in the Markets and an advice clinic in the Belfast Islamic Centre.\"I reached out on Twitter to the LGBT community and the GAA. Im confused about claims that I havent reached out. The DUP condemns paramilitary flags, but I try to sit down with people to address issues rather than just jumping up and down about them.\"Over in the liberal and increasingly Catholic Rosetta area, residents certainly dont see their DUP MP as a bridge-builder. At many doors shes denounced in a way that youd expect in republican Belfast, not in this middle-class and moderate district.SDLP candidate Claire Hanna doesnt bring her rival up, but voters do. \"I cant stand that woman Pengelly,\" a female householder says. \"I want to wake up on December  to find the nightmares over and we have a new MP.\"A pensioner says: \"Shes not our MP, she never was our MP. In the two years since she was elected, Ive not seen her once around these streets.\"Hannas canvassers meet outside The Frying Squad chip shop. Its by no means purely an SDLP team. Two Green Party activists and two former Womens Coalition members are there. data-dfpadtargetingLisburn Road in south BelfastThe candidate needs to secure support from outside her partys usual voting base, and the evidence from the doors is that shes doing that.\"I normally vote Alliance, but youll get my preference this time because I think youre the person to oust our current Westminster representative\" a man tells her.\"If you lend me your vote, Ill look after it,\" Hanna pledges.A Co Armagh teacher says: \"I usually vote People Before Profit, but Im with you in this election. I hope Enmma Little-Pengelly comes to my door so I can give her a piece of my mind.\"Hanna is warm and chatty as doors are opened by busy parents putting kids to bed or mums already in their pyjamas.\"Id be in mineI wasnt out here doing this,\" the candidate says. Many know her from the school gates or parks. Others have seen her whizzing about the area on her bike.One woman asks who will succeed her as South Belfast MLAshes elected to Westminster. \"There will be an internal party contest. Weve a lot of bright young things who will be eager to take the Assembly seat off me in a heartbeat,\" she explains.A pensioner advises her that she should fight this election not just by knocking doors, but on social media as well. \"I dont know anything about it myself, but you must get on all those sites the young people are on Claire,\" she urges.Michael Westland offers a cup of tea and more. \"There are five votes in this house, Claire, you dont need to ask,\" he says.\"Youre one of the few intelligent politicians on TV. Youre logical, rational and you dont tell lies.\"The compliments for Hanna come so thick and fast at the doors - \"You echo what I think\", \"I trust you\", \"You keep my faith in politics\" - that its almost embarrassing for her.She blushes and jokes to one voter that all the praise means \"its like being at your own funeral\".On a two-hour canvass, there are only three out-and-out noes for the SDLP woman. One family is solid DUP. A man looks at the SDLP leaflet through his glass door and shakes his head. Another man opens his but the conversation is brief. When asked by Hanna what the big issues are for him, he replies: \"My dinner!\" She admires the handsome Christmas wreaths bursting with pine cones and blood-red berries hanging from many doors. Election demands mean shes behind on the Christmas front herself, \"although the kids do have an Advent calendar, and the decorations are out but not up\".Over in the religiously mixed middle-class Sicily Park in Finaghy, Alliances Paula Bradshaw is setting a brisk pace. Its late afternoon and most householders arent in, but she posts signed and timed leaflets through their doors.Privately, she must be annoyed that almost every journalist and commentator is putting Hanna ahead in the Alliance-SDLP race for the Remain vote. Yet admirably she doesnt complain.\"Im not taking it personally and I can understand why Im not the favourite to win this seat. I think I would have been had the pact between the SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Greens not happened,\" she says.\"But I would argue that Alliance cant be written off. We match the DUP in South Belfast in terms of councillors. We both have eight to the SDLPs four, and unofficial figures from Mays council election put us on % in the constituency with the DUP on .% and the SDLP on just .%.\"The Green Party may have stepped aside and endorsed Hanna, but Bradshaw claims that its voters arent listening.\"I havent met a Green supporter yet who is going SDLP, theyre all voting Alliance,\" she says.And she questions just how many Sinn Fein voters will come out for the SDLP. \"Ive found apathy about the election in the Lower Ormeau and the Market,\" she claims.\"There are also a fair few DUP voters telling us theyre disillusioned with the party - that its made a hames out of Brexit and theyre fed up with the scandals. Some are coming over to us, others arent. Theyll just stay at home.\"Voters at two homes in Sicily Park give off to the Belfastabout the DUP - one over Brexit and another over the health service. Three members in the latter household work for the NHS and arent impressed - to put it mildly - with Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and the DUP candidates husband.\"South Belfast is being very East Belfast in this election,\" says Bradshaw. \"Normally, its residents are reticent in expressing their preferences, but theyre shooting from the hip this time round.\"Alliance are going great, although we dont really have strongholds. Somewhere like Stranmillis is excellent for us, but theres no place that well come in with % of the vote. Our strength is that we poll solidly across the constituency.\"Bradshaw reports the issues raised on the doorsteps as \"health, no Stormont, Brexit and abortion\"in that order.At one house, a woman praises Alliances stance on equality issues. Shes confused over Brexit. She supported Remain, her husband was a Leaver. She tells Bradshaw shell consider voting for her.But a few doors down, a woman is undecided about how shell vote and says shell wait to see what her husband does. \"Ive heard that at a few doors,\" the Alliance candidate says.Although Bradshaw will poll well, this feels first and foremost like a Hanna-Little-Pengelly fight. The DUP could winthe Remain vote splits evenly, but theres a confidence about the SDLP candidate and her campaign that is unmissable.

Ironically, after a series of meetings with unions yesterday, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had posted an optimistic tweet that he was hopeful that agreement could be reached..pushWithin a few hours, however, the relationship between the unions and health service officials had reached a new low.Despite Julian Smiths earlier optimism, it was hardly surprising. Throughout the entire process, the unions have refused to budge from their position that nothing less than pay parity with the rest of the UK is acceptable.Read MoreDoug Beattie: This is not about spreading fear, it’s about seeing patients like my darling little grandson die on a waiting listNI health crisis: Unions reject new pay offer from Department of HealthHe needs to do something: UUPs Beattie urges Secretary of State Smith to address escalating health crisis in Northern IrelandIts dficult to argue with their position - Northern Irelands health service is in the midst of a workforce crisis.Many staff are working to the point of exhaustion, unable to guarantee the safety of their patients, and an increasing number are relying on food banks to feed their families. They look across the water at colleagues being paid thousands of pounds more for doing the same job, with better conditions, and it is little wonder they have said enough is enough.It is unknown whether Julian Smith knew the details of the financial package that was to be offered to the unions yesterday afternoon when he posted on Twitter. But even before the negotiations began, the unions warned no agreement could be reached without pay parity, and knowing the current financial climate, it was dficult to see how the Department of Health had magically found the £m it needed to reach an agreement on the issue.As it turns out, the money wasnt there and talks have broken down once again. The Department of Health has insisted it has no more money to give.So, where does that leave staff and patients Until now, the public has been overwhelmingly in favour of the unions position, but time will tell whether the support remains as more patients are affected by the disruption. Plans are being finalised in all trusts as to what services are to be affected in the days and weeks ahead and it is likely that the Belfast Trust will continue with its almost blanket cancellation of outpatient appointments and elective surgery.It will also be interesting to see whether union members can financially afford to continue with prolonged industrial action or whether they will feel the impact on patients is too great.As it stands, it appears that Julian Smith is the only person who can now bring an end to the deadlock in the absence of a health minister.It is understood he is the only person who can go to the Treasury and ask for money.But with just a week left until the General Election, it is likely his attention will be where.However, without intervention by Mr Smith, we will be relying on the resumption of the Assembly.It remains to be seen whether Northern Irelands politicians are willing to put their dferences aside to ensure the future of the health service."},{"url":null,"title":"dissidents santa with rifle image condemned by the psni","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

People Before Profits Gerry Carroll is also aiming to repeat his achievements in recent elections.This constituency has seen signicant development in recent years, including the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, but it is still pockmarked by high levels of unemployment and deprivation.However, West Belfast has also largely reinvented itself as a tourism destination, turning the Troubles into an attraction.Ads for the area urge tourists to \"visit Clonard Monastery with its sumptuous Rose window\" and \"walk up Divis or Black Mountain and be spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat afterwards\".The internationally popular Lonely Planet guide says: \"Though scarred by three decades of civil unrest, the former battleground of west Belfast is one of the most compelling places to visit in Northern Ireland.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet data-dfpadtargetingFrank McCoubreyGerry Carroll\"The Falls Road and Shankill Road are adorned with famous murals expressing local political and religious passions, and are ided by the infamous Peace Line, separating Catholic and Protestant communities.\"The glossy language and hyperbole mask an area still scarred with social problems, including the highest poverty levels in Northern Ireland.A tongue-in-cheek letter to the Irish News last month poked fun at the achievements and verbal ability of the abstentionist Mr Maskey, who has held the seat since Gerry Adams decided to run in the Republic.The mischievous letter drew a reply a few days later, questioning the original letters veracity, but there is little doubt Maskey will romp home. He enjoys the largest majority of any Northern Ireland MP.What he may lack in vocal dexterity he more than makes up for on social media, tweeting last week that Santa had taken a few hours off to support striking health service workers \"who had all been good boys and girls this year\".Mr McCoubrey, the veteran DUP candidate, also has a Twitter account, which tends to retweet Nigel Dodds a lot, but he came second place to Mr Maskey last time round.Mr McCoubrey also pushed Mr Carroll into third after the People Before Profit man slashed Mr Maskeys majority two years earlier and amassed % of the vote.Mr Maskey said his recovery was \"no fluke\" but was down to hard work and delivery.Major talking points within the constituency include proposals for  new homes at the Glenmona site near Upper Springfield and the failure after more than , days to get planning approval for the new Casement Park plans.Mr Maskey has been vocal on both issues. \"I have families who have been on waiting lists for up to nine years. The shortage of social housing is one of the biggest issues,\" he said.\"I have pointed out to planners that applications lodged after Casement have been approved. It will be the jewel in the crown of West Belfast.\"Big-ticket issues such as Brexit are also to the fore. West Belfast had the second highest vote for Remain in the  referendum .Ongoing violence is also an issue, however.Two weeks ago, a family had a lucky escape after an air freshener exploded on top of a wood burning stove, a few days after a pipe bomb was defused in a front garden.Mr McCoubrey has claimed the unionist vote in the area has almost doubled in recent years, leaving the DUP \"knocking on the door\" in West Belfast.Mr Carroll has also insisted that his aim is to win the seat, though his campaign will also be seen as a dry run for the next Assembly election.Alliance candidate Donnamarie Higgins said the constituency needed a strong pro-Remain voice and argued change is possible \"when people vote for it\" as they have in a pro-Alliance surge which saw the party take the third MEP seat this year.New party Aontu will be interesting to watch, particularly in terms how many votes it can take from Sinn Fein.Candidate Monica Digney said: \"Irish MPs north and south  years ago did not stand idly by like Sinn Fein do today. They refused to go to Westminster but went to Dublin, which is what we will do, demanding the right to represent people here.\"SDLP stalwart Alex Attwood has, after many years of struggle, left the battleground and, apparently, politics altogether.His long-serving councillor brother, Tim Attwood, polled just under , votes in the constituency, a fall of %, and came in fourth.The constituency has expanded in the recent past, taking in Dunmurry and the northern part of the Derriaghy council ward in , but the change did not affect the proportion of Catholics to Protestants.

Local SDLP Assembly Member John Dallat has warned that the lack of money to upgrade will impact particularly on first-time house buyers who will face a serious hike in prices as developers are forced to provide their own treatment works.He said: “This underinvestment has been creeping up for several years and is now at crisis point with the building industry worst affected and that not only affects house prices, it endangers jobs and will be seen by investors as a deterrent to investing in those towns were sewage capacity is at its limit. “Other smaller towns in the Causeway Coast and Glens Council area, including Kilrea, are among the  towns and villages that cannot offer sewage connections for new developments. The last two houses built in Kilrea are on septic tanks!”He continued: “In correspondence with NI Water I have been told that only  out of the  waste water treatment works and networks can expect upgrading without investment in the region of pound million. Only pound million is available.“The impact of this is serious not just because it will stop ew developments but there are environmental issues which in time will impact on the quality of our water in our waterways, rivers and beaches. “He concluded: “Our health is our most important priority and clean water is key to ensuring the fight against pollution of our waterways and the question is: ‘Why on earth are two political parties keeping the assembly mothballed while our infrastructure in lacking serious investment to such an extent that it is no longer possible to make basic connections to sewage systems ” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Unusually, there has been no lull in numbers since July and the emergency department has come under sustained pressure. Its fairly relentless seven days a week, said Mr Gillespie.Mr Lavery outlined a combination of factors including an increase in out-of-area attendees, older patients, and children.Traditionally Altnagelvin ED treated around , attendees but that has surged over the past five years. The department was built to hold - patients at a time, one night last week there were  patients in attendance, and the figure regularly sits around -.The current facilities were not built to cope with the almost , patients now flowing through its doors each year, that figure is expected to rise to around , next year.The Derry News recently reported that the business case for AE expansion at Altnagelvin has reached its “final stages”. It would accommodate an anticipated , annual attendees. However, it requires funding approval and ministerial sign-off and delivery is likely to take a number of years. Pharmacy staff are taking strike action today, December , and Wednesday, December .Industrial action will put additional pressure on services throughout December, with Royal College of Nursing members taking action short of strike on December  and again on December  , then full strike action on December . “That is being managed on a daily basis and a contingency plan is in place,” Ms McKay said.She added that there has been “no additional investment” this year to deal with winter pressures from the department or health and social care board.The majority of patients attending are doing so for category   health care which is deemed “immediate very urgent”. googletag.cmd.push Statistics A newly published Department of Health report shows that in September a .% of patients arriving at Altnagelvin’s Emergency Department required treatment for “immediate” and “very urgent” health care.That is signicantly higher than any other emergency department in Northern Ireland with, for example, the Royal Victoria Hospital treating .% of patients in the same categories.All of the issues mentioned above have contributed to missed waiting time targets, in September last year .% of patients were treated within the -hour target, that fell to .% in September this year. The number of patients waiting  hours has risen from  in September  to  in the same month this year.The target to commence treatment within -hours also declined throughout July, August and September.Other hospitals have been similarly affected, for example, In September the Royal Victoria scored .% for its -hour target and there were  patients waiting over  hours. Ms McKay said the Trust’s priority is to “make sure patient care is safe and therefore whatever we need, evenpatients have to remain in the emergency department, we’ll make sure we have enough nurses to look after them and take care of them, and enough doctors to see and treat them in a timely manner. Irrespective of anything  that is our focus.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He says there is a “deepening crisis” and this winter we must be prepared for “unprecedented risks” to quality of care and patient safety. He has pointed to an ageing population, delayed transfer of care, inadequate nurse staffing levels and lack of funding as contributing factors. “While often seen by many as an ED standard, waiting times such as the ‘ hour standard’ and the number of patients spending gt  hours in our EDs are better seen as barometers of the wider health and social care system pressures.“Over a third of our patients currently spend gt  hours in our EDs, with  patients spending gt  hours in our EDs in the  months from April - September  - a year on year increase of %.In the last  hours alone around  patients spent gt  hours in our EDs.“The waiting times in our EDs are virtually entirely attributable to factors out with the control of our ED teams.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs are as a result of our growing and ageing population compounded by failures in other parts of the health and social care system including access to primary care, elective care and palliative care.“Increasing numbers of patients attending our EDs is accompanied by increasing numbers of patients requiring hospital admission and therefore beds on wards.“There is a lack of al capacity in our hospitals as a result of the reduction in the number of hospital beds by around % since   compounded by the extraordinary number of bed days lost as a result of delayed transfers of care.“A delayed transfer of care is where a patient is deemed to be medically fit to be discharged from hospital but where this cannot occur due to the lack of availability of social care, such as packages of care to support a patient in ing home, or residential or nursing home places. “The outrun of this is that bed occupancy is running at% across many of our hospital sites in core specialties such as general internal medicine and care of the elderly when the widely accepted standard is %.“Consequently, there is a lack of patient flow through our hospitals and onwards into the community, with the majority of our patients referred for hospital admission spending long periods of time in our EDs awaiting beds onwards.“When the majority, or all, of the rooms cubicles in our EDs are occupied by patients awaiting beds on wards then there is physically no appropriate space to assess further patients.“Furthermore, there are often inadequate nurse staffing levels to safely manage the clinical workload. The numbers skill mix of nursing staff may be below that required to deliver safe, effective care in a timely manner to our ED patients, let alone to do so concurrently with those patients awaiting beds on wards.“The lack of appropriate physical space and inadequate nurse staffing levels further impacts on the waiting times for those patients who are not referred for admission.“As we approach the winter months from our lowest ever baseline we must expect waiting times and the unprecedented risks to quality of care and patient safety to increase further as even more of our patients spend even longer in our even more crowded EDs.“In practical terms, it is simply impossible for our ED teams to be expected to deliver more with less year on year.“The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has consistently highlighted the deepening crisis in our EDs over time.“Seeking to do things dferently or more efficiently will not offset the need for corrective investment to increase staffing, the number of acute hospital beds and the social care that are fundamentally required.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Long-running plans suffered a further setback in recent weeks when it emerged that student intake for the  academic year had been ruled out. The revised target is recruitment for .In its initial phase the Medical School will be based in existing buildings at the Magee campus. Annual running costs of poundm had been quoted by the Department of Health.Ulster University has provided a breakdown of costs, details that would’ve formed the basis of its business case submitted to the Department of Health.The university says it will cost poundm per year to train  medical students, a third of which goes directly to Health and Social Care Trusts.An Ulster University spokesperson said: “In its initial phase of implementation the medical school is intended to be delivered within the existing campus estate, alongside current medical and healthcare provision.“The projected running cost for  medical students by  , when the Graduate Entry Medical School would be fully operational, is poundm per year. This is the annual cost to train doctors to completion of their Foundation training.“Of this, almost poundm is University funding for teaching and appointments and just over poundm is for the Trusts and GP practices whilst the students are at University. Just over pound.m goes directly to the Health and Social Care Trusts for the salaries, essential further training and assessment of just over  of our qualied medical graduates once they are Foundation doctors working in hospitals, caring for patients. “Annual costs for the implementation phase over the first four years of operation are considerably lower.”Plans for a medical school in Derry have been ongoing for the past fteen years before truly taking shape in  when its case was submitted to the General Medical Council.The first cohort of students were due to start training at Magee this year but that target was missed and planned intake for  has now been shelved.The Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Care and its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together. Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications. Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional poundm per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of the University of Ulster in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.It is anticipated around  doctors will train in Derry in the schools first year, rising to  students per year within its first five years. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr Murphy was in court last week to contest the costs the department is seeking from him. He lost his judicial review in  in the High Court and Court of Appeal and failed in his application to have the case heard in the UK Supreme Court. However, he and his campaign supporters remain hopeful that the matter will be heard in the highest court in Europe, the European Court of Justice. “The Court of Appeal, acknowledging that my case was of public interest, made no order as to costs. The United Nations and the IPCC have issued warnings as recently as this week that countries must make their protected areas bigger and more connected. They have called for a five-fold increase in efforts.”“What is unfolding at Lough Beg is the complete opposite of what the Northern Ireland government must do in the face of the planet’s climate and ecological emergency.”He stated that: “The DfI’s reckless disregard for the climate crisis and the well-being of countless future generations, swans, orchids, insects, otters and eels is a crime against the planet. “Under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives as transposed, the deliberate destruction of a protected habitat such as the wet grassland at Lough Beg, which is ally linked to the Lough Neagh and Lough Beg Special Protection Area, is a wildle crime.”“What continues to motivate him is the hope, shared with thousands of others, to save something of le on earth that is accepted to be special and rare, an ecosystem that could be infinitely giving. “Lough Beg is Ireland’s premier freshwater wetland for bird le. It’s  bird species are more than any other inland site in the whole of Ireland. Since  it is listed as a Ramsar Site of International Importance as a Wetland for Water Birds, and was designated a European Special Protection Areain .”He adds: “Lough Beg’s wild swans, lapwings and curlews that my we, Doris Noe, and I have watched and loved for  years have no way of coming to court themselves. “In the absence of membership organisations such as the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trustand the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds– who we discovered have bought into the scheme – Doris and I went to court to speak on behalf of this wetland and its wildle.”“We spoke the truth about what we know of climate science and ecology. We presented incontrovertible evidence and statements of fact, together with relevant case law and statutory law. “Through time consuming cross-referencing and Freedom of Information enquiries we uncovered numerous, serious irregularities which the Department for Infrastructure, its consultants and the RSPB, have until now covered up. “For example, the suppression of ‘inconvenient’ advice, evidence, legal or scientic information out of date conservation objectives distortion and manipulation of essential data the absence of expert, independent or objective consultation other than that received from its statutory conservation advisors all of which was either concealed, conflated or ignored.”“The inclusion in the scheme of a suite of mostly meaningless and unproven measures agreed between the department’s consultants and the RSPB poses a grave risk to all protected wildle and their habitats. “The European Court of Justice has deemed identical measures in Ireland, Holland and Germany to be unlawful.”“This unlawful ‘mitigation’ includes carrying out research into a discrete population of wild swans for the purpose of testing theories relating to controlled disturbances during the construction of a dual carriageway on top of their ancestral wintering home. This ‘research’ commissioned by the developer and paid for by the taxpayer is a wildle crime in itself.”He added: “Our legal action was the last resort in a long-running campaign to save Lough Beg. We are heartened to see that the public discourse is coming to understand the dangers of environmental degradation we were trying to highlight in court. I met the court’s Taxing Master on Wednesday and am faced with paying costs awarded against me by the High Court in April , invoiced almost two years later.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show. I had never done one that quick before and on the day I was hoping that I would be able to get it finished.Emma said that she got her love of crafting from her grandmother, Violet Spence, who still competes as a member of Drumbo Womenrsquos Institute, and her mother, Linda Davies, who kept the tradition going.Emma can be contacted on Facebook and Instagram as Emma Phillips Handmade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 4%2C 1979  ","story":"STRIKE mdash The bin strike in Down District has ended and normal bin collections have resumed. The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses. Every trader in the town signed the petition.At their last meeting committee members agreed to ask Mr Powell to take up the fright. He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality. The pound, illuminations were erected by Mr Sean Murnin and his son, Paul.ARDGLASS mdash One womanrsquos battle to collect enough money for two kidney machines took a giant step forward in Ardglass this week.She is Mrs Winnie Cully, of Portavogie, and she was in Ardglass to collect two cheques totalling almost pound from fishermen, fish salesmen and friends in the port.The first cheque for pound came from the skippers of  Ardglass fishing boats and was handed over by Mr James Smyth, while the second cheque for pound was from six fish salesmen and three friends. It was handed over by Mr Willie Williams.Already the gold-hearted Winnie has raised pound,, but she still needs another pound before she can present two kidney machines to Belfast City Hospital.She started fund-raising two years ago when her son was on a kidney machine at the City Hospital. ldquoSince then he has had a kidney transplant, but I have my heart set on raising this money for the machines to help someone , she said.LISTOODER mdash Listooder and District Ploughing Society held their th annual competition on Saturday and were fortunate to have excellent weather, good ploughing conditions and a record turnout.These all helped to create a big interest for both spectators and competitors, making it one of the best the society has held.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead. Man of the match Lyons found room out on the left flank, left two defenders for dead and drilled a low effort past McDowell to make it -. Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield. And the Ballynahinch men had another great chance after a great run by Mason down the right wing.His cross found Jones free with only the lsquokeeper to beat, but Dillon ed to his right to save one-handed and gather the ball with  minutes remaining.But just two minutes later Olympic were celebrating a second goal as Molloy met a Jones corner to head home what proved to be the winner.Olympic had to survive a late scare when they conceded a free kick on the edge of the D in injury time, but Sterlingrsquos shot was blocked, as was the follow-up from Briers, epitomising the determined defensive work of Olympic that was a feature of the game.Rathfriland needed penalties to see off East Belfast in the other semi-final, after it finished -, with their lsquokeeper Jonny Parr the hero as he saved all three East spot kicks.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Ryan Noade, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Shane Murray, Ryan Molloy.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

But she was so happy - she said it was the perfect place as it was the start of so many good memories, and that she never anticipated it would happen in Stanwell.ldquoMy first thought when she said yes...

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/buil1.jpg","title":"nine storey office scheme for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew A new proposed nine-storey office building in the heart of Belfast city centre could house up to  workers once completed, Ulster Business can reveal. There are now plans to build the grade A office building at Victoria Street. It would see the current Chancery House building knocked down to make way for the development. In , the building was sold off in excess of its guide price of £.m following a competitive bidding process. Chancery House, which is located on the edge of Belfast’s Law Courts and opposite Victoria Square Shopping Centre, was purchased by a local private developer. The fresh planning application has been made by Chancery House Investments Ltd, which includes Northern Ireland businessman Darren Donnelly as a director. Its being designed by Todd Architects alongside planning consultancy Turley. The building would include more than , sq ft of grade A office space, and those behind it have said it “would assist in addressing an identied need in the marketplace for small office floor plates to primarily serve indigenous businesses which are expanding and want a city centre business location”. It also says the design of the development “has been carefully formulated and responds to the immediate context of the site and its surrounding”. “The proposals improve the setting of the Old Town Hall and define its location with a building which adds vibrancy to this important nodal point”. A design statement says the development could accommodate between - office workers. Speaking at the time of the sale of Chancery House, Neil McShane, director at Lambert Smith Hampton, who the sale process, said: “Chancery House represented a unique opportunity in that it is an income-producing investment property with exciting development prospects. The prime location and secure tenant means that it will continue to perform well as an office investment but,redeveloped, will attract signicant interest from potential occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
