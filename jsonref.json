He was so uncomfortable in his skin about being gay even though he said he wasn\u0027t.\u0027 Earlier this month his Wham! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley, 56, has told how the ‘façade’ of heterosexuality was a burden on his friend as he refused to publicly reveal that he was gay, believing it would damage his career.While Michael came out to school friend Ridgeley way back in 1983, while they were shooting the music video for Club Tropicana in Ibiza, it would be 15 years before the rest of the world knew.Michael’s ‘persona which he constructed for public consumption’ didn’t give him space to ‘develop his true self’, Ridgeley wrote in his new autobiography.         Sir Elton, 72, opened up to Sharon Osbourne on her American chat show, The Talk         Sir Elton had called Sharon after George Michael died almost three years agoHe said the singer was ‘beset by confusion as a consequence of his sexuality’ and struggled to ‘define the reality beneath the public image’, causing a tension which ‘only seemed to play out more publicly later on.’‘Beyond the close inner circle nobody really had a clue, so while the reality of maintaining the façade wasn’t tearing George apart, some cracks were definitely starting to show,’ he wrote.He said that Michael’s ‘ambition to succeed had taken priority over everything else and that included his ability to openly express his sexuality.’According to Ridgeley, the pop star struggled with the public persona he created so he didn’t have to reveal his true self.‘The persona which he constructed for public consumption hadn’t left George with a lot of space in which to develop his true self behind the scenes,’ he wrote.‘He was driven by an unstoppable desire to fulfil his potential, but that had come at a price. As a young man still trying to find himself, George’s ambition to succeed had taken priority over everything else and that included his ability to openly express his sexuality.’         Sharon Osbourne spoke to Sir Elton about his close friend George He said that his decision to stay silent about his private life ‘only fed the uncertainty about his public persona.‘What the real implications were for George, I can’t say, but I knew he was never comfortable with the added interest that came with Wham! hitting the big time.’He added: ‘While on tour, working with Wham!, George was presenting a public image that didn’t come naturally to him.’He said that George was ‘adamant his sexuality should be kept under wraps’ which ‘created a whole unwelcome extra level of stress for him to manage.’He added: ‘I had certainly never met any boyfriend that George might have had while we were together as a band.‘He thought coming out would scupper chances of competing with artists like Madonna and Michael Jackson in the States.’Michael refused to come out even after his boyfriend Anselmo Feleppa died from AIDs in 1993. "},{"url":null,"title":"We need thousand Rudy Giuliani butt dials reporter leaves accidental voicemail","story":"Share this articleWhile Working for Trump, Giuliani Courts Business Abroad - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Female barrister 54 TWO elderly live lovers allowed hold fortunes","story":"Share this article          Oxford University professor Christopher Gosden, son of Dr Weddell, has been told he has no valid claim on the estate of his mother, which ended up mostly going to Miss CookJudge Mark Pelling QC has now ruled that while Professor Gosden’s lawyers could have prevented the sale of his mother’s house without his knowledge, he was not due any compensation because his mother could ultimately have insisted that she wanted to sell her house and move in with her younger lover.There was no evidence she lacked the mental capacity to make rational decisions.And he said that Miss Cook’s huge inheritance from her other elderly lover, Miss Southworth, did not mean Dr Weddell could not have wanted to give her more.

Pictured: Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks to schoolchildren during his visit to Middleton Primary School in Milton KeynesBut there are only 288 Tory MPs – meaning that even with the support of Lib Dems and Scottish Nationalists, Johnson is likely to fall about 80 votes short in his bid on Monday to have a national poll on December 12. Despite holding this zombie Parliament hostage, Corbyn\u0027s control of his own party is getting weaker by the day.Yesterday, there were reports that he had been \u0027taken prisoner\u0027 by his chief whip to stop him unwittingly blundering into giving ground to Boris Johnson.This came after some Corbyn\u0027s allies said their boss would secretly be content to let Johnson \u0027get Brexit done\u0027 and fight an election in the spring. The reasoning for this is that with Brexit out of the way, Labour might take electoral advantage from the Lib Dems being deemed an irrelevance because their flagship \u0027No Brexit\u0027 policy would have been wrecked.         Increasingly, Corbyn is, in the words of one Labour MP with whom I spoke yesterday, the party\u0027s \u0027LINO\u0027 – Leader In Name Only.He has become the puppet of Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, who, aided by Sir Keir Starmer and Diane Abbott, want to stop Brexit – and only then fight an election.To add to the disarray, most Labour MPs are terrified of a December 12 election because they are convinced the Tories will win – not least by exploiting Corbyn\u0027s serial failings.All this said, Corbyn\u0027s army of fanatical young supporters in his hard-Left Momentum movement power base still think he walks on water. They believe that just as he came from a long way behind and nearly beat Theresa May in the 2017 election, he can do the same to Boris Johnson.For his part, despite his infectious optimism, Johnson is trapped. He can\u0027t yet deliver Brexit and he can\u0027t call a general election.He has little choice but to try to persuade everyone – regardless of how they voted in the EU referendum –that it is in Britain\u0027s best interests to \u0027get Brexit done\u0027 and to shame Labour into agreeing to an election.In the meantime, officials in Downing Street and Brussels have already started preparing for the depressing possibility that Britain will miss a fourth deadline – probably January 31 – for leaving the EU. If this happened, we could still be in the EU next April, nearly four years after the referendum.By then, Remainer MPs would say the case for a second referendum – their best hope of wrecking Brexit –would be unanswerable.Is that really in Britain\u0027s best interests?"},{"url":null,"title":"Northern Delights Aurora Borealis seen time UK winter","story":"Share this article   There are two types of Aurora - Aurora Borealis, which means \u0027dawn of the north\u0027, and Aurora Australis, \u0027dawn of the south.\u0027The displays light up when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the Earth’s atmosphere.Usually the particles, sometimes referred to as a solar storm, are deflected by Earth’s magnetic field.Auroras are typically green due to collisions with oxygen particles, but ‘exciting’ different atmospheric gases can produce a blue, violet, yellow, or even red colour. As these reactions occur at the magnetic poles this is why auroras are most likely to be seen in Scotland and the northernmost parts of the UK. But during stronger storms they enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles, including hydrogen and helium.These collisions emit light.

For the American artist Jann Haworth it has taken half a century to correct a particularly high-profile piece of historical bias.In 1967, Haworth and her then husband Peter Blake made one of the most famous commercial artworks of the modern age: the cover of the Beatles album Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Among the 65 different people it featured, from Albert Einstein, Fred Astaire and HG Wells to the occultist Aleister Crowley, there were only 12 women and, as Haworth admits, three of those were different images of child star Shirley Temple.What is more, Haworth, a young female artist at the time, found her own key role in creating the cover was ignored for years.Now Haworth and her daughter, Liberty Blake, are bringing to Britain a work they started together in 2016 to set straight the record of women’s achievements. Their Work in Progress mural – seven panels, 28ft long and 8ft wide – displays the faces of more than 100 influential women who have either been written out of history or marginalised.“We have notable women there, like Twiggy, the judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the aviator Amelia Earhart, notorious spy Mata Hari, and Rosalind Franklin, the scientist whose crystallography enabled the discovery of DNA,” said Haworth, 77.“Really the point of this project is that you will recognise some of the faces, but not others. The feeling of knowing and yet not knowing these women’s full stories is part of the meaning. It makes it distinct and it almost makes you shiver.”The artist, who collaborated in workshops with volunteers from Salt Lake City, near her home in Utah, to make the artwork, believes it is important this project remains unfinished, a work in progress, because it would impossible to correct centuries of conventional history that have left women out.“It is also significant that other people contribute, because I know very little about, say, astrophysics and women in other fields. And women’s real value in the world is not just about their place in history books. So the workshop process is almost more important than the outcome,” she said.In 2009, Haworth brought another attention-grabbing feminist work over to Britain: her Mannequin Defectors series, which showed corset-wearing shop clothes dummies rebelling by carrying protest placards. It has always upset her that most of the female images on Sgt Pepper were decorative figures.“We asked the Beatles to give us names of their heroes and none of them came up with women,” she said. “I take some responsibility though for the fact that Peter and I only used a few.” In her view the “only good one” they included was the sassy film star Mae West.The Blakes had known the Beatles for four years when they were asked to design the front of their eighth studio album, the psychedelically-inspired LP that went on to spend 27 weeks at the top of the British charts and features songs such as Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, With a Little Help from my Friends, and When I’m Sixty-Four.Paul McCartney has claimed he had the original idea for the image and John Lennon later sketched a final version, but Blake and Haworth created it together, choosing the characters and ruling out suggestions, including Lennon’s that Adolf Hitler should appear.Neither Blake nor Haworth heard the tracks on the album until after they watched the cover photographed by Michael Cooper in his studio. Haworth constructed the figures on the cover like a stage set with full-size models she made, as well as waxworks borrowed from Madame Tussauds. The couple were paid only £200.“We were all young and foolish at the time,” Haworth recalled. “Peter would have done it as a small-scale collage but I wanted the front row to be three-dimensional.”After a painful orce in 1984, Haworth returned to America. She now feels that the mural of women she has made with their 51-year-old daughter, which goes on show at Pallant House in Chichester from 2 November, is a powerful way of bridging that family “rift”: “Libby, like her father, is a detailed collagist and she is very much part of this project. So in some way this is a synthesis and a healing,” Haworth said.There was a discussion about whether to include Princess Diana in the mural, someone only famous by marriage, and Haworth also admits to over-ruling the face of Margaret Thatcher. “It is my artwork after all,” she said.

He returned as a photographer to document the town’s transformationby Lindokuhle Sobekwa and Sean O’Toole“I first went because my mother used to be employed there as a domestic worker,” says photojournalist Lindokuhle Sobekwa. “When I first visited Daleside, to me it seemed an isolated place, a ghost town.”Daleside used to be a white-dominated area, but now it is mixed. In the early 2000s Sobekwa’s mother took a job as live-in help with a white family in this town south of Johannesburg. As she struggled alone to support her four children he only saw her on weekends and during school holidays.“I would visit Daleside with my brother and we would assist her with things like garden work,” says the 24-year-old Magnum nominee who grew up an hour away in the eastern Johannesburg township of Thokoza. All his work, he says, took place outdoors. “The people my mother worked for didn’t allow me inside.”Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa\u0027s cities remain hugely ided, both economically and racially. This week  Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope.\u0026nbspAfrica correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town\u0027s spectacular beaches and trendy cafes.Author\u0026nbspNiq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the other Soweto, one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see.\u0026nbspWe hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children.\u0026nbspWe explore the deadly underground world of\u0026nbspzama zama\u0026nbspgold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay\u0026nbspby Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper.The racist snub prompted his fascination to see more, to venture past the threshold of the stoep. More than a decade later, having established himself with a remarkable photojournalism project on drug abuse in Thokoza, Sobekwa returned to Daleside.“I realised that I had built up an illusion of what I might find,” he says. “Daleside has changed since 2001. There are now black people living there, and there is also visible separation between rich and poor.”Unlike its neighbour, Henley on Klip, a swanky riverside settlement once described by an apartheid parliamentarian as “one of the most beautiful residential areas in the Transvaal”, Daleside more accurately reflects the renamed Gauteng province’s industrial character. Located next to an open-pit dolomite mine, adjacent to a busy highway connecting Johannesburg with a constellation of manufacturing towns to its south, Daleside’s inhabitants are a mix of small-scale farmers and mine workers.“Daleside is a forgotten area,” says Sobekwa. Class has complicated the region’s older racial binaries. “The rich area nearby is protected by a lot of security guards carrying guns. I tried to photograph there but was told to leave.”Photographing in Daleside proved no less difficult at first.“People still confused me for a garden worker.” Sobekwa’s camera was also a source of distrust. “There is heightened suspicion because of the killing of white farmers. They thought I might be a criminal.”Sobekwa says it was easier to work when he was with his travel companion, French photographer Cyprien Clément-Delmas.“For me, when I’m with Clément-Delmas – my white, French, collaborator – it is easier to work there. But when I’m alone – when he goes back to France – it is a bit challenging for me. I have to constantly be careful how I approach people and their personal spaces.”The pair befriended a kindly pastor at a local church to help gain the trust of Daleside’s conservative white community.Among the photos Sobekwa has produced for their work-in-progress book on Daleside are frank portraits of residents in their bedrooms. One shows an adolescent girl with ginger hair reclining on a bed with a pink crocheted bedspread. Pasted on the wall behind her are hand-drawn pictures and photos torn from magazines. “I was amazed to see posters of people she looked up to on the wall,” says Sobekwa. “This is what we do in the township.”Sobekwa met the girl’s family at the supermarket and he has often visited them. He has even been invited to stay over – a noticeably different attitude to that of some white families in the town who have refused to be photographed. There are no mixed-race couples in Daleside.“Cyprien did some interviews with the white residents by himself,” says Sobekwa. “I was so surprised at what they told him. Most of them don’t like black people. They say black people have brought crime, drugs, all the bad things.”Religion is an important facet of life in this community. Christian icons are commonplace in its homes, says Sobekwa. For the photographer this is another point of overlap with life in South Africa’s black townships. He describes the inhabitants of Daleside as being in “the same trap as poor black people” – dependent on religion at a time of worsening income disparities and economic stagnation.Sobekwa sees similarities between the challenges facing Daleside and the township of Thokoza where he grew up. “This helps me relate to them, to some extent,” he says, “but there are also differences that make it difficult for me. As an outsider, most of the time I was mistaken for someone who was looking for a job. This wouldn’t happen if I was there with Cyprien.“At times I’d also feel like I wasn’t connecting with them: for me it is important to connect with the people I photograph. I think it was because I kept being reminded that I did not belong there, even though I felt like I did because of those similarities I saw between our communities.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3c18304db6b10ad7da03485de3d6e53bcd49ec7/0_152_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc0ae21e35653d861b804c6c4fb4083f","title":"benefit assessor more afraid state poverty","story":"When the Department for Work and Pensions deemed me ineligible for payments, I realised: there is no safety netOne morning eight years ago, as I was preparing to go to work, I had an unexpected brain haemorrhage. It was like being hit by a train from the inside. I fell to the floor in agony and somehow didn’t die. The bleed squashed a part of my visual cortex, leaving me permanently visually impaired. Doctors called it a sight deficit (deficit was a trendy word at the time).I began to have bouts of stress, anxiety and depression. I would need several operations on my brain to prevent me from having a second, fatal bleed. To help me in day-to-day living I was awarded the lowest rate of disability living allowance (DLA). When I wrote a novel, Animal Lovers, I gave my main character a sight deficit as well.In January 2018 I was told that my DLA was being scrapped. Presumably this was punishment for the notorious role disabled people played in the financial crisis. I would now have to apply for personal independence payment (PIP).An assessor came to visit. She seemed nice. I did my best to be good company, in the hope that this would help. She asked me if I carried a white stick. I told her I had been given one but it was too short and made me look like Sooty. She laughed at this, then stopped laughing and made a note.Her report said that I had no visual impairment and could see well enough to drive. I was surprised by this, as I hadn’t been able to drive even when I could still see. It said I did not suffer from stress and anxiety, on the grounds that I was engaging, made eye contact and “seemed calm”. While this was flattering it didn’t consider that I had tried my best to be all these things because I was meeting someone with the power to ruin my life. The report complained that I went regularly to the theatre, without mentioning that I’d been working in a theatre and had to quit because of my condition.It also observed that I “had written a novel”. This was my biggest mistake. Novelists are famously free from mental health problems and bad eyesight. What’s more, we are liars. I wondered if Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) staff had read my book for proof of fraudulence, like FBI agents going to John Lennon concerts in hippy wigs.The report concluded that I was ineligible for any payments. I lodged an appeal and waited. I’ve been waiting for 80-odd weeks.During this wait my eyesight has got worse. I have had three more operations on my brain. I have written another novel and have done my best not to starve. I have got used to the panic when an unexpected bill has arrived, the sleepless nights from dreading an undetermined future. The DWP said that long delays were to be expected, were par for the course. I moved to a cheaper, grottier flat and told the DWP – twice, to be safe.My stress and anxiety fluctuated but got worse whenever I spoke to the DWP. A system designed to contribute to disabled people now seemed designed to contribute to our disabilities. I felt too scared to ask what was happening with my appeal. Maybe the DWP would test my eyesight by challenging me at archery. Maybe it wanted me to have another haemorrhage to see if that made any difference.Eventually I called. I was told that an initial appeal had already taken place. There was surprise that I hadn’t attended it was felt that my not being there didn’t help my result. The DWP said it had sent the summons to my old address. Giving it my new address hadn’t made much difference. Maybe its staff thought if I was genuinely visually impaired, I’d not see the letter wherever they sent it.It was at this point I realised I was dealing with an entire organisation of frustrated comic novelists. Sometimes you just have to realise when you’re outclassed. They wrote to me asking, more in sorrow than anger, why it had taken so long to chase the results of my appeal. The fact that I didn’t know it was happening only added to their suspicion.It feels odd, for someone who grew up in a welfare state, to shake off the idea of a safety net, the notion that in hard times the state will be there to help. Being accused of faking my visual impairment was my first experience of being treated like a criminal. I began to fear the state more than I feared poverty. In periods of joblessness I resisted signing on, to avoid the threat of sanctions. I may have known my rights but it felt safer not to assert them.Still, I wonder if persuading vast numbers of people that the state is now their enemy is liable to backfire. The vulnerable have votes and one day they may use them. Then again, they might not. More than 17,000 people have reportedly died while waiting to hear if they were eligible for PIP. Sometimes if you avoid tackling a problem for long enough, the problem goes away.• Rob Palk is the author of Animal Lovers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5c4889441d37107a0c2d13e59fb0bb3bfc72d92/0_170_2997_1798/master/2997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28ceff57c8ca6b1b4865799c9e3d5da7","title":"katie jarvis was it necessary to shop her for working in a shop","story":"You can understand why seeing someone you know from EastEnders working in a shop might make you look twice. If I nipped to the post office and Kat Slater was selling stamps, I’d probably go back. She ain’t my muvva! But she might be able to offer me a competitive rate on euros.Even so, there was something sour and not quite end-of-episode-bong-worthy about a tabloid’s decision to put the actress Katie Jarvis on its front page after she was spotted working as a security guard. “I woke up really embarrassed and really made to feel quite ashamed, to be honest,” she told Victoria Derbyshire last week.Jarvis left the soap in February this year and at some point started working at B\u0026ampM, where her sister is also a security guard. I don’t know if it’s because we expect performers to maintain the illusion of being someone else, lest we start to realise that the stories we are glued to are made of scripts and sets and real people dressed up and pretending, but we all know that the entertainment business is tough and fickle.Famously, The Cosby Show’s Geoffrey Owens was snapped working in a US supermarket last year, leading to accusations of “job-shaming” and an outpouring of support from the industry. The support for Jarvis, too, came quickly. “Person gets job so her kids don’t starve? Good for her,” tweeted Kathy Burke.But there was something else. It wasn’t so much the notion that Jarvis was doing a non-acting job so much as the emphasis on the fact that it was in a shop if she had been working as a part-time lecturer, say, would it have even made it in to print? (With apologies to working-class lecturers, of course, but it just sounds like a fancy job.)It reminded me of an old reality TV competition theme, in which a contestant would be promised that they’d never have to go back to working in a shop again, like it was some shameful prison from which everyone must be desperate to escape. The snobbery was palpable. Good for Jarvis for explaining how how actors, and how people, work, because that’s what most people simply have to do.Nineteenth-century female authors might have had to pretend they were men in order to have their work published, but finally, at long last, now is the moment to be corseted, writerly and long dead.Apple is launching its TV subscription service with, among others, Dickinson, about the poet Emily, who would definitely have been on Tumblr and used black lipstick Instagram filters were she here to see the internet age.Now HBO has upped the stakes by ordering a pilot about my favourite, Mary Shelley, who lived such a biopic-friendly life it’s a wonder there isn’t a new film about her every year.As a teenager, she began an affair with Percy Bysshe Shelley, a married man, whose wife later killed herself they fled the country while unmarried and travelled around Europe with her stepsister, who may or may not have been involved with Percy romantically. Then, when she was 18, she practically invented modern horror by writing Frankenstein, a novel so much richer than any plastic Halloween mask could ever begin to hint at.Somehow, this powder keg of a life was turned into a so-so film last year but the new series, The Shelley Society, sounds like it will be far less faithful to history and more indebted to the spirit of this incredible woman. Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the creator of Riverdale, will run what has been described as “a Victorian X-Files”, in which Shelley will lead a band of Romantic outlaws against supernatural threats. It could be promising, not least because it puts Shelley in charge, which is exactly where she should be.The comedian Kelly Bachman made headlines last week with a standup set about Harvey Weinstein. So far, so 2019, but it had a twist: her gags were off the cuff and delivered with a dry yet righteous fury, because Weinstein was in the audience, watching. He had a table at an event called Actors Hour, at a bar in New York, designed to support young comedians and actors, and if anyone knows about supporting actors, it’s Wein... hold on.“I’m a comic and it’s our job to name the elephant in the room, do we know what that is?” said Bachman, from the stage. “It’s a Freddy Krueger in the room, if you will. I didn’t know that we had to bring our own mace and rape whistle to Actors Hour.”Watch the video. Many have commented on how uncomfortable it is. One man in the audience – of course it’s a man, shouts: “Shut up” – while you can hear women cheering her on. Bachman is witty under what must have been horrible strain naturally it’s uncomfortable, as it should be. Weinstein’s publicist – it remains a job – put out a statement calling the “scene” “downright rude”. I’ll go for downright heroic and brave, instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6af4947f58093c4070cc3922dfb00d8f50e6f261/0_51_5926_3554/master/5926.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=675f2e208ca0152dc84e3ba3d0ca5b82","title":"charlotte gainsbourg everything now so politically correct boring","story":"The actor and singer grew up in her parents’ shadow, and starred in Lars Von Trier’s most extreme films. She talks about why she’s finally comfortable in her own skinWhen Charlotte Gainsbourg was 16, she came home from school to find her mother distraught and the police waiting for her. They had just discovered that she was the target of a kidnapping plot. A gang of upper-class teenagers – journalists called them the blousons dorés (golden jacket) gangsters – had planned to kill a police officer and steal his uniform. Then, using this disguise, they were going to abduct Gainsbourg and demand a 5m franc ransom from her famous parents, Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. The gang, who had already committed several armed robberies, had found a country house where they were going to hide Gainsbourg. They had even bought shovels with which to bury the police officer.Gainsbourg laughs as she recounts the episode: “I thought it was so cool.” Her mother and father weren’t quite so blase. “I remember my parents being extremely scared and my father made me go to school with a bodyguard.” She stares into her coffee, stirring in milk for longer than is necessary. “I was so ashamed.”But Gainsbourg spent her childhood in the public eye, with a mother who epitomised 60s cool and a father whose provocative and often alcohol-soaked antics often made headlines. There was the time he appeared with Whitney Houston on primetime TV and announced that he wanted “to fuck her”, for example. On another live TV show, he burned a 500 franc note to protest against what he considered excessive taxation. Gainsbourg’s classmates didn’t respond very kindly to that stunt. “At school, the kids took my worksheet and they burned it,” she says. She laughs quietly. “So I did get… I did get bullied.”Her father died of a heart attack in 1991, when Gainsbourg was just 19. She still seems to worship him and says she misses being “able to ask him all the questions about music that I have today”. She speaks fondly of the way he used to come up with melodies and test them on a little focus group consisting of her, her mother, and his artistic director. “We’d make little asterixes next to the melodies we preferred,” she remembers. “Even though I was just a kid, he wanted my point of view.”When she was 12, Gainsbourg made her musical debut alongside him on the song Lemon Incest – a play on un zeste de citron (a lemon zest). In the infamous video, Gainsbourg is sprawled on a bed while her topless dad caresses her and sings about the love they will never make together. The song, recorded in 1984, was accused of glamorising abuse and paedophilia, but despite the scandal – or perhaps because of it – Lemon Incest peaked at No 2 in the French charts.Gainsbourg has spent decades fielding questions about Lemon Incest and is less than thrilled when I ask her whether something similar could be released today, let alone spend 10 weeks in the Top 10, in the era of #MeToo. “It was already shocking at the time,” she says with faint exasperation. “I remember my father having to explain himself, and his lyrics, because he plays with the jeu de mots, how do you say that? When you play with the sounds of the words, like a double meaning?” Gainsbourg is bilingual, but French is her first language she pauses occasionally in our conversation to search around for le mot juste. We settle on “pun” and she continues. “Incest is so shocking and so taboo. It’s as if he was amusing himself with that. But when you listen to the lyrics, he’s just talking about the infinite love of a father for his daughter and of a daughter for her father – and you can’t condemn that. Because there’s nothing physical. So, yes, he says incest, but that’s it. I find it terrible that you can’t talk about things that are…” she trails off, searching around for the right word. “Difficult?” I suggest. “Nuanced?” She shrugs. “You hear the word ‘incest’ and conversation gets shut off,” she says. “There’s no dialogue.”Still, Gainsbourg says brightly, she had a “completely normal and very simple childhood”. She was born in London, but grew up in Paris. Apart from regular ferry trips to England to see her maternal grandparents, the family travelled little her father was scared of planes. Her parents split up when she nine, but Gainsbourg remained close to both, as well as her half-sister Kate Barry, the late fashion photographer (Birkin’s first daughter, with the English composer John Barry). All in all, she says, life “was very square”.These days, Gainsbourg seems drawn to square pegs in round holes: men like her father who are both outsiders and insiders, who use outrage as a weapon against a society in which they have never felt welcome. Some might call them provocateurs, others perverts. One of her most notable collaborators is the Danish film director Lars von Trier, whose dark, psychological films Gainsbourg has appeared in – Nymphomaniac, Antichrist and Melancholia – reflect his battles with alcoholism, depression and various phobias. (Like Gainsbourg’s father, Von Trier is terrified of flying.) In Von Trier’s films, these battles are often acted out violently on Gainsbourg’s body: in Antichrist, she plays a grieving mother who cuts off her clitoris with a pair of scissors in Nymphomaniac, her character has graphic sex with strangers.Gainsbourg has often been called Von Trier’s “muse” – but that is too passive a word to describe the actor. Part of her allure is that as a performer she is impossible to categorise neatly. She is not a stereotypical sex symbol or a damsel in distress, and she is not just an instrument for older men to act out their provocations she uses them just as much as they use her. In all of her parts, you get the sense that she is the one in control.Von Trier’s films have frequently been described as misogynistic, but Gainsbourg rejects that idea, saying that she has done some of her best work with him. “He gives such wonderful parts to women,” she says. “How can he be misogynistic if he’s portraying women like that?” What about Björk, I ask, who starred in his film Dancer In The Dark? In 2017, as #MeToo started to become a mainstream movement, Björk claimed that she had been sexually harassed by an unnamed film director many assumed to be Von Trier. He denied the allegations.Rest is one of her rawest and most personal albums, and a lot of it stems from grief. In December 2013, her half-sister Kate died after falling from a fourth-floor window in Paris. Her death made living in Paris unbearable, Gainsbourg says. A few months after the tragedy, she decamped to New York with her partner and their three children. “I was coming from a very dark place,” she says. In the US, “I was breathing again and seeing new sky. I thought: how come I haven’t done this before? It’s wonderful to just take a bag and go somewhere else.”In France, Gainsbourg is recognised wherever she goes and is known, first and foremost, as the daughter of Birkin and Serge. In New York, she is finally starting to break free from that history. “I feel ashamed saying this, but when people recognise me here it’s about me,” she says. “The films I’ve done, a lot of Lars’s films, and my music. I don’t get recognised that often, but when it happens I’m really proud.”At this point, a stocky man, dressed neatly in black, walks in and starts addressing her in French. I assume it is an adoring fan, but it is her partner, the French-Israeli actor and director Yvan Attal. After a second, he apologises to me for being rude and continues in English – he just wants a quick word about their lunch plans. The quick word is had and he disappears, presenting the perfect opportunity to start talking about him behind his back.Hang on, I say: if she had chosen to get married, she would have changed her name? “No, not at all,” she backtracks. “I’m very attached to my name, because of my father. But what’s funny is that I was registered under Gainsbourg, which was not my father’s real name. He was called Ginsberg and he changed it for work. On his passport, it was still Ginsberg. When I was 18, I asked to go back to my old name, just to have the same as him. It was such a big deal to go through all the paperwork, but we did it. I’m very proud of it, because that’s my story. I feel very close to that past.”Has Brexit made her feel even less English? “No,” she says. “I am very proud of my British passport. It is so stupid. It’s a little booklet, but I cherish it. Maybe it’s my mother, who transmitted something, some pride in that nationality.”She has lived in New York for five years, but says there is a cultural ide she hasn’t been able to bridge. “I haven’t been able to get close to American friends. I feel I don’t understand them completely. It’s hard to – I feel stupid making generalities, but it’s so money-oriented. In France, we’re all about having lunch, dinner. It’s a real art of life, art de vivre,” she says. “And that’s what I love. I love time off.” In the US, she says, everyone is working all the time. “I feel they pretend that’s what they want, but they’re just forced to work all the time.”For all this, Gainsbourg admits that she is a workaholic herself. She has released five albums and been in more than 40 movies her latest is a French comedy called My Dog Stupid, directed by Attal and featuring her son, 22-year-old Ben (her daughters, Alice, 16, and Joe, eight, live with her in New York). She also models, and is the face of Saint Laurent. But while she doesn’t show any signs of slowing down, she has started to worry that the work will dry up as she gets older.Now she is approaching 50 and still getting parts, still making music. After decades of grappling with the burden of her name, Gainsbourg is starting to consider herself a success in her own right to feel that it is OK to be proud of herself. She may worry about wrinkles, but she is finally comfortable in her own skin.• Charlotte Gainsbourg wears Saint Laurent by Anthony VaccarelloIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication).• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

The Local Government Association (LGA) has called for a review to make the system more inclusive.Elizabeth Coatman, the state education specialist at the Good Schools Guide, said parents should provide the total number of choices including any school they are in the catchment area for – even if it is as their final choice – to avoid local authorities inevitably filling in blank spaces with the least popular schools.The comments come as families across England complete secondary school application forms before the 31 October deadline.Schools with good results and reputations are most likely to be over-subscribed, the Good Schools Guide said, but can also have complicated policies setting out how they will decide which pupils will be given places – known as over-subscription criteria.“The variation in admissions policies is incredible,” Coatman said. “What one school demands of an applicant may be very different from the requirements of an apparently similar school down the road.“I have every sympathy for parents who find getting to grips with the complexity of some state school admissions policies gives them a headache. We have seen one that runs to 12 pages.“Setting aside time to research options and work out the likelihood of a successful application, not to mention fathoming the further obligations and paperwork as required by some schools, is labour intensive and no doubt favours certain sections of society.”A spokeswoman from the LGA said: “We want to be sure that schools admissions policies are inclusive for all local children.“This is why the LGA believes the government should hold a review to make the system simpler and more inclusive so all children can get the best education possible.”A Department for Education spokeswoman said concerns over admission arrangement at state schools should be raised with the schools adjudicator.“We are committed to offering parents and children a erse education system.

Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.There are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden’s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg’s solo protest has since become a global movement.Climate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.Business and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.From giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.These are huge questions, and  readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.Our economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come.We are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short.Writing in the  earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said.Without action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year’s Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state’s history – cost insurers more than $12bn. Banks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.Many companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.We are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.Our reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.Most corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.Investment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal \u0026amp General, Europe’s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.”However, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock’s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.”They do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.Fashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the mostimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.We aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. Wewill continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readersparamount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.We have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.What does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintagepieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.None of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too.There’s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it’s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.Meat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public’s focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.It’s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, ided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It’s also a time when it’s difficult to know who to believe and to trust. I hope people can be sure of the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe269d9ec06740a551d25fa8d8e07c902892cd2/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d6b0d86d0b03a66ff9f5ee4bdec8e2","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 images pictures guidelines","story":" picture editor Fiona Shields explains why we are going to be using fewer polar bears and more people to illustrate our coverage of the climate emergency At the  we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face. Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3858d96ea129929c09d1781ed401f522605d3b80/218_2651_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a34a700de9e45906839302b85b17e9","title":"have you spotted any new buds or flowers in october","story":"If you have seen any plants flowering unusually this month, we would like to see your photosAccording to former  environment correspondent Paul Brown, “new research published in Geophysical Research letters show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago”.Some people have reported seeing new flower buds in the unseasonal temperatures, leading to worries the flowers will be killed by the winter weather and may not bloom again in spring.If you have seen any plants with new buds or flowers appearing we would like to hear from you.When did you first see them and do you have any concerns about what it might mean for them come spring?

Calvert-Lewin and Delph are both on. Championship: Harry Cornick has leapt off the bench to score an equaliser for Luton at Birmingham . Harry Wilson is on for Bournemouth at Vicarage Road. Surely a free-kick is now the best chance of seeing a goal in that game. There’s a supporter on as a fourth official at Southend. How neutral can he really be? It’s still only 1-0 to Ipswich. Can Sol Campbell work his magic for the Shrimpers? Championship: Preston have battled back from 2-0 down against Blackburn and have levelled the match up at 2-2 thanks to goals from Tom Barkhuizen and Daniel Johnson, who just held his nerve to score from the penalty spot. The Blades are level. And it’s Mousset, the man who scored the winner against Arsenal, who has come off the bench to score it, steering a right footed volley into the far corner. Pascal Gross has stabbed the ball home for Brighton … but he’s flagged for offside. It’s still 1-1 with Everton. Championship: Charlton have equalised against West Brom. Macauley Bonne has nodded home. It’s 1-1. The Ideal Boiler mascot will be gutted! Karlan Grant has given Huddersfield a 2-0 lead against rock-bottom Barnsley. It’s his seventh of the season. He’s been so important this season. Serie A: Lecce have held Juventus to a 1-1 draw so Inter can go top if they beat Parma at home later. There have been some fun and games in Croatia this afternoon. Hajduk Split won 2-0. Can’t imagine Slaven Belupo took it well. West Ham waste a three-on-two attack! Yarmolenko plays a lovely ball into Anderson who shoots straight at Henderson instead of squaring to Haller, who had an open goal. Will they regret that? Action at Vicarage Road! Action at Vicarage Road! There’s almost a goal. Delufeu has a close-range stab at goal but Ramsdale does a Schmeichel-style star jump in front of him and deflects the ball wide for a corner. It’s the second half in matches up and down the UK. There was quite the goal in the National League game between Stockport and Dover. We need footage of this. You know what, it might look like this: Scotland’s not exactly raining goals, either:There aren’t many goals around are there? Maybe it’s the weather – or perhaps Leicester just took up the weekend’s entire goals quota last night. I’m not a betting man, but if I was, I’d sell my house and put all the money on a 0-0 draw at Boro. Lecce have equalised against Juventus. They’re drawing 1-1. If they can hold on that would be some result. It would also give Inter the chance to go top in the late kick-off. What’s happening at Watford v Bournemouth, you ask? Nothing. Nothing is happening. Well, that’s blunted the Blades. Sheffield United fail to deal with a long ball forwards. Yarmolenko plays a simple square pass to Snodgrass, who races into the box and finishes clinically with his left foot. Lundstram has hooked a left-footed shot a few inches wide after a smart attack by the Blades at the London Stadium. They’re finishing the half the stronger side. Ryan is having a solid game for Brighton. He’s just got across smartly to prevent Everton taking a 2-1 lead after a shot deflected off Webster and looked to be heading into the corner of his goal only for him to stretch his long frame to get his hands to it. Half-time scores from the Bundesliga: Championship: Fulham are down to 10 men at Middlesbrough. If ever there was a chance for Boro to end their six-game winless run, it’s today. they just don’t score many goals, though. One of Everton’s best players this season has been Bernard, but the poor chap has done himself some harm and may be out for some time. Just as I post that last update from east London, Sheffield United almost take the lead against the run of play. The ball bounced across McGoldrick in the six-yard box, who flicks a leg out and erts the ball towards goal, where Roberto scrambles it away. Good save. West Ham are all over Sheffield United at the London Stadium but they haven’t found a way through the Blades’ defence yet. Pellegrini will be happy with the way his side are dominating possession, though. They’ll have to be patient. League One: Shrewsbury have taken a 1-0 lead against Sunderland thanks to Jason Cummings and Oxford Utd are 1-0 up against Rochdale. Southend are still only 1-0 down to Ipswich too. The Sol effect! Walcott has a great chance to put Everton 2-1 up but Ryan is out off his line quickly to block the shot at the far post. The angle was against Walcott. It wasn’t the easiest chance. A good response by Everton, though. Silva will be delighted. Well, that didn’t last long. A simple corner to the near post that Richarlison heads against Webster and into the bottom corner. It may go down as an own goal. There’s a VAR check on it but it will be given.Brighton are in control at the Amex. They’re bossing possession with some lovely little triangular passing in midfield. “That burnt-orange Tango Rosario is truly a sight to behold. I would frame a giant photo print of the thing and hang it on the living room wall if the missus would let me,” writes Peter Oh. “About your quip that Ralph Hasenhüttl should get the LMA Performance of the Week award. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has two more points than Hasenhüttl.” Honk! Pascal Gross has belted a 20-yard free-kick past Pickford to give the Seagulls the lead! It went through Pickford’s hands. He won’t be happy with that. It was struck firmly but the keeper should be able to deflect that away. Championship: Matt Philips has put West Brom 1-0 up against Charlton. The ball deflected off his heel and into the top corner. Not a bad place for it to end up. There are still no goals in the Premier League. This was never going to be a classic clocko, was it? One for the purists. Watford have suffered an injury blow in their match against Bournemouth. Tom Cleverley has twanged a muscle and Will Hughes is on inhis stead.League One: Oh Sol! It’s Southend 0-1 Ipswich. They held out for eight minutes and then James Norwood struck. The Shrimpers have shipped 24 goals in seven games. Oof!Declan Rudd has given Blackburn a 1-0 lead at Preston. That’s a long time to hold on at Deepdale, mind. It’s ended Exeter 4-0 Plymouth in the Scrumpy Jack derby. That’s an impressive win – and it’s lifted Exeter up to second in League Two.West Ham really should wheel Carlos Tevez out to do the half-time raffle in the match against Sheffield United today. It’d spice the atmosphere up a bit.Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich are 1-0 up against the league’s hippest club, Union Berlin. Benjamin Pavard scored the goal. Dortmund are being held at Schalke but there’s plenty of time left yet. There’s a special “Sol Campbell” edition match programme at Roots Hall. Get yours now!Here’s Jamie Jackson’s match report from the Etihad, where Manchester City eventually cruised to a 3-0 win over Aston Villa: Chris Wilder has won an award which I believe they have just made up this season. It’s called the LMA Performance of the Week award. Sheffield United’s 1-0 win over Arsenal was deemed good enough for Wilder to receive said gong. They should really give it to Ralph Hassenhutl next week.It’s a great result for West Brom, who kick-off against Charlton top of the Championship. A number of Football League games have been washed off today by biblical rain in the midlands and north-west of England. Here’s an up-to-date list:Here’s a picture of the only ball that should be used in winter months - not least because if it actually snows you can still see the thing, unlike the diabolical yellow one.Peep! It’s all over at the Etihad. And here’s how the Premier League table looks before the 3pm kick-offs.Manchester City are cruising to a 3-0 win against Aston Villa, though Fernandinho has managed to get himself sent off, which will give Pep Guardiola another headacheexciting tactical puzzle to solve in the coming weeks. Watford make two changes. Holebas, who is suspended, is replaced by Masina. And Deulofeu replaces the injured Welbeck. Danjuma, King and Lerma come in for Bournemouth. Manuel Pellegrini has taken an axe to his West Ham team after the defeat at Everton. He’s made five changes. Angelo Ogbonna, who was so influential in defence at the start of the season, is one of the casualties. Lanzini and Fornals also join him on the bench. Lys Mousset, who scored the winner against Arsenal, is on the Sheffield United bench today. He’s replaced by Callum Robinson. Mason Holgate is in for the injured Yerry Mina as Silva sticks with the Everton midfield and forwards who were so effective against West Ham. The 21-year-old Steven Alzate replaces the suspended Aaron Mooy in Brighton’s midfield.With Liverpool not in action until their home game against Spurs tomorrow, Manchester City can close the gap at the top to three points.

We also have what might be a spicy match at the London Stadium, where West Ham take on Sheffield United. The Blades hate the Hammers because they believe Carlos Tevez, who relegated them in 2007 after scoring the winning goal against Manchester United at Old Trafford, should not have been eligible to play for them. Jacob Steinberg goes into greater detail about the bad blood in this fine piece of writing here:After a fine start to the season, West Ham aren’t playing well and are in danger of going into freefall having not won a game for over a month. The Blades, meanwhile, are going to bounce into the capital full of beans after beating Arsenal on Monday. Bournemouth travel to rock-bottom and winless Watford in the last of the 3pm Premier League games. I fancy them to end that run against the Cherries. Watford were great against Spurs last weekend and deserved to take three points away from north London. Bournemouth haven’t won since 20 September, when they won 3-1 at Southampton, a result that looks modest after Leicester’s evisceration of the Saints. And that’s your lot for the English top flight.I’ll keep a close eye on goings on across the Football League and anything of interest in Europe, too. With Leeds currently in action at Sheffield Wednesday, Championship high-flyers West Brom will hope to beat mid-table Charlton to pull clear at the top.And if you’re wondering who could have a worse weekend than Southampton, what about Southend? Sol Campbell officially takes charge of the League One club today in their home match against joint-top Ipswich having watched them lose 7-1 at home to Doncaster on Tuesday.In the Scottish Premiership (which already looks like a two-horse race), Rangers and Celtic both play tomorrow, having been in Europa League action on Thursday. If you want to check today’s fixtures across Europe in all the leading leagues, use this handy link. And I’m a firm believer that the yellow ball above is rubbish. A winter football should be an orange Adidas Tango or nothing else. Also, they shouldn’t be allowed to use a winter ball until after the clocks go back. Thoughts?

She tends to like fiction that involves a neighbour having an affair with a murderer who happens to be hiding in plain sight as a primary school teacher, or something. I scoffed at her suggestion, and went back to reading my non-fiction book about patterns of behaviour on public transport. But when my wife went to get ready for dinner, I picked up her book, to provide myself with the ammunition to be smug about her literary choices while we ate, like the prick I am. As I chuckled to myself about how superior I was, I began reading. My internal monologue went: “This is so awful. Why would you waste your time with this? This dialogue is a bit naff. Oh God, who says naff any more? Am I getting old? Only old people say naff. That neighbour seems a bit suspicious to me. What is he up to? I’ll just read a bit more. Oh God, I think I love this book.”I finished it that same evening. My wife was delighted. Her smug bastard husband had succumbed to the world of light fiction, and loved it. It turned out that she was the one with the ammunition over dinner, and my attempts at claiming I had enjoyed it ironically were pathetic even by my standards.This is not to say that I don’t still enjoy non-fiction it’s just that I have been labouring under the assumption that I only like highbrow books about the human condition when, actually, I also love to smash through a book about a man having an affair with a woman who regularly kills cats.It occurred to me that I might have been overestimating my tastes elsewhere, too. My hip-hop podcast has meant that I stay across as much new music as I can, but I have very much nailed my colours to the mast: what I like is a particular style of lyrical, intricate, boom bap hip-hop. That is, until I took my kids to watch Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, the soundtrack to which features Post Malone. He’s a rapper who looks like that mate who grew up on your estate, took LSD once and never fully came down, but he is also one of the biggest stars in the world. I have previously tried to avoid him. But when I finally listened to a Post Malone playlist, my internal monologue went: “This is not for me it’s so obvious. This beat sounds dope, though. Who says dope, any more? You are so old. This track is catchy. This next track is catchy. Oh, I think I love Post Malone.” And I do. It turns out I really do, and I’m going to get a face tattoo.Deciding to just like what I like has proved to be incredibly liberating. I have started eating peanut butter and banana sandwiches. I have bought a BMX bike. The other day I sat down to watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians, and I actually thought it was a pretty compelling watch. And it was during my third straight episode of this, an episode in which 15 minutes was spent discussing the merits of bone broth, that I realised what was happening.The books were fine, the music was fine – but my journey had gone too far. I had embraced being myself a bit too much, and it’s possible that I might be a moron. So excuse me if you will – I have some soul-searching to do. After I watch one more Kardashians episode."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98f887f5a3918ac1cd5c014061c16d5e9d45fd6c/295_300_2239_1344/master/2239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24865626d40162e4175730e94f06b3b7","title":"mandy patinkin wish pursued more friendships running out time","story":"The actor and singer on an early encounter with Marilyn Monroe, missing his father and spending a lifetime learning to listenBorn in Chicago, Mandy Patinkin, 66, made his Tony award-winning Broadway debut in Evita in 1980. His films include Yentl, The Princess Bride and Wonder. On television he has played CIA agent Saul Berenson in Homeland for the last seven seasons, receiving four Emmy nominations. Children And Art, Patinkin’s first new album since 2002, has just been released. He is married with two sons and lives in New York City.What is your greatest fear? Dying, and sometimes living.What is your earliest memory? When I was four, we were at Midway airport in Chicago, and there was a large crowd of people surrounding a lady – everyone was screaming at her, lights were flashing. It was scary. I later learned she was Marilyn Monroe.What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? Second-guessing myself: being a Monday morning quarterback for everything I say and do.What makes you unhappy? Feeling that I have disappointed my wife, my children, my friends, my co-workers, my audience.If you could revive something extinct, what would it be? All the lost languages, indigenous cultures, plants and animals that we have let die.What is the worst thing anyone’s said to you? “I hate tenors and I hate Jews, but you moved me.” Said by an audience member who waited to meet me after a concert. I was horrified that a human being needed to couch a compliment in hate.Is it better to give or to receive? Giving is receiving.What single thing would improve the quality of your life? Less work, more living.To whom would you most like to say sorry, and why? To my father, for not telling him the truth when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and going along with the family lie that he had hepatitis, when he knew he didn’t. At the age of 17, I lacked the courage and strength to stand up for what I believed.What does love feel like? Love is a religious experience, which then requires me to define religion, which I define as everything I don’t understand. Have you ever said ‘I love you’ and not meant it? Yes, I sign most emails and correspondence “love Mandy”, because I want to mean it.What has been your biggest disappointment? Citizens around the world blaming others for their personal disappointments, othering them, labelling them, terrorising them with hate-filled rhetoric and shutting the doors of their hearts.If you could edit your past, what would you change? I would have been a better listener. I would have pursued more friendships instead of focusing so much on work and myself. I’m doing all that now, but I’m running out of time.What keeps you awake at night? Not being at peace with myself, in spite of an ongoing lifetime effort to try to calm down and accept that, no matter what, I did the best I could.What is the most important lesson life has taught you? To take chances and know it truly doesn’t matter whether I succeed or fail.Where would you most like to be right now?

Blunt did not say whether he would perform at Glastonbury’s 50th anniversary.He said: “I’m off on my tour from February around the UK. I will be doing some summer festivals.

A Treasury spokesman said: “We have paused production of the Brexit coin, and will take a final decision in due course.”There has been speculation that the estimated 1,000 coins minted so far could fetch a premium on the 50p cover price, possibly selling for as much as £800 each.The chancellor, Sajid Javid, had ordered 3m of the coins to be made ready for the end of the month with the inscription “Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations”. Underneath the inscription, the Mint placed the historic date the UK is supposed to leave the EU: 31 October 2019.Treasury officials refused to say whether the Mint will release the coins into circulation or seek to realise their inflated value by selling them on its website.The chancellor could decide to melt them down to be remade with a new date but officials are unlikely to risk going ahead until parliament and the EU give further clarity.Javid’s predecessor, Philip Hammond, had planned a limited edition of about 10,000 commemorative coins to be sold to collectors for £10 each in time for the first deadline on 29 March.The 50p move is the Treasury’s second U-turn in 24 hours after it confirmed that it had pulled a budget due to be held on 6 November, when the government would have detailed its economic plans and tax and spending priorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/307557c85e048282fe4b7a9d59e8c3eb02e7fb4f/0_102_2119_1271/master/2119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21afc59593d31012beb861172108ef40","title":"tories deny compromise workers rights after brexit","story":"Business minister defends Johnson after Labour says PM misled parliament with his plan for exiting the EUThe government has denied it has misled parliament and that it is seeking to tear up provisions for workers’ rights after Brexit.The business minister Kwasi Kwarteng admitted on Saturday that it would be very difficult for Britain to leave the European Union next week, but he dismissed reports employees’ rights would be slashed after Brexit as “way exaggerated”.He said it was for the EU to decide whether the UK was granted an extension, with deliberations in Brussels continuing into the weekend after Boris Johnson grudgingly requested a delay to Brexit.Fresh scepticism over the agenda of Johnson’s government is likely to impact ongoing EU27 discussions after the Financial Times reported that the prime minister was willing to consider erging from EU standards on the environment and workers’ rights.According to the report, the leaked document said the way the political declaration – the agreement setting out the aims of the future trade negotiations between the UK and the EU – had drafted workers’ rights and environmental protection commitments left “room for interpretation”.It reportedly boasts that “UK negotiators successfully resisted the inclusion of all UK-wide level playing-field rules” in the previous deal negotiated by Theresa May’s team, allowing Britain to compete against EU members by possibly watering down rights.The document, which has not been shared with parliamentarians or the public, goes to the heart of Labour’s concerns that workers’ rights and environment rights would be tampered with if the Tories were in power after Brexit.Jenny Chapman, the shadow Brexit minister, said: “These documents confirm our worst fears. Boris Johnson’s Brexit is a blueprint for a deregulated economy, which will see vital rights and protections torn up.“It is also clear Boris Johnson was misleading parliament earlier this week. You simply can’t trust a word Boris Johnson says. Under his proposals, this Conservative government has no intention of maintaining high standards after we leave the EU.”Those fears are particularly felt in Berlin, as speculation mounts that Johnson is preparing to reform the UK into a low-tax, lightly regulated economy described as “Singapore-on-Thames”.He told MPs this week that the UK was committed to “the highest possible standards” on both sets of rights. This stance helped convince 19 Labour MPs to back his withdrawal agreement bill at its second reading on Tuesday.The Department for Exiting the European Union initially declined to comment on Saturday morning. Later, a government spokesperson said: “The UK government has no intention of lowering the standards of workers’ rights or environmental protection after we leave the EU and we already exceed EU minimum standards in areas such as maternity leave, shared parental leave and greenhouse gas targets.“UK level playing field commitments will be negotiated in the context of the future UK-EU free trade agreement, where we will achieve a balance of rights and obligations which reflect the scope and depth of the future relationship.” The EU has insisted any future relationship should be based on a level playing field. After a meeting of EU ambassadors on Friday, a Brussels source said there was full agreement on the need for an extension and that work would continue over the weekend.The final decision on whether the EU will opt for an extension until January or a shorter November delay is not expected until Monday or Tuesday. It is believed that Emmanuel Macron, the French president, is not in favour of the extension stretching into the new year.Kwarteng said: “I think it will be very difficult to leave on 31 October precisely because of the Benn act, the surrender act, which essentially gave authority to the EU, the other side, about whether we will leave on 31 October or not. It looks like they may well give us an extension.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc06aa9f220ef23aa95b0ad305cfd707b009e880/0_171_5142_3085/master/5142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e091d62087eb93ef5f563666ab6b87f8","title":"england new zealand rugby world cup reaction steve hansen all blacks","story":"• England coach says his team will have to be even better in final• ‘We wanted to take it to them, to put them on the back foot’Eddie Jones says England have beaten the “god of rugby” with their historic World Cup semi-final victory over New Zealand but believes they will have to get even better to lift the trophy next Saturday. England moved to No 1 in the world rankings for the first time since 2004 after reaching their first World Cup final in 12 years but Jones insisted his side must complete the job against either Wales or South Africa to justify that billing.Manu Tuilagi’s second-minute try and three George Ford penalties sealed England’s first ever World Cup win over the All Blacks and takes them 80 minutes away from emulating Sir Clive Woodward’s class of 2003 and their own piece of sporting immortality. It was a sixth career win for Jones against New Zealand and one of the most dominant performances in World Cup history.“New Zealand are the god of rugby, so we had to take it to them,” said Jones. “We wanted to take it to them and show we could take the game to them, try to put them on the back foot as much as we could. They are a great team. They have won two World Cups in a row. They have got a great coach, a great captain, so we had to battle hard today.“You always go in with an idea of how you want the game to be, but it never goes exactly like that. You have got to give so much credit to New Zealand, the way they kept fighting right until the end. We had to dig deep to win that game.”Regardless of who wins Sunday’s second semi-final between Wales and South Africa, England will go into Saturday’s final as favourites, having started yesterday’s semi-final as underdogs, given that New Zealand were the reigning two-times world champions. Asked where it ranked in terms of England’s greatest ever performances, Jones added: “We have another week and we’re looking forward to it. We’re not historians, we don’t know but we know that we can play better next week. We’re going to have to play better next week, whoever we play against.”Jones will either pit his wits against the Springboks, for whom he worked as a consultant for their 2007 World Cup triumph, or renew rivalries with Warren Gatland, but said he had no preference. “We don’t control that, mate. But I’ll definitely come and watch the game,” he said. “We’re looking forward to Wales and South Africa playing a 3-3 draw, so they have to play extra time, it’s still 3-3 and they have to play more extra time!”Tuilagi was the chief protagonist the last time England beat New Zealand back in 2012 and he was among the standout performers again. In the intervening seven years he has been blighted by injury problems and after his try proved decisive in seeing off the All Blacks he said: “It’s beyond my dreams. It’s an unbelievable feeling. It was amazing to get through to the semis. Standing here now and we’re in the final.”The New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, who steps down after the World Cup after eight years at the helm, was magnanimous in defeat and conceded that England fully deserved their place in the final. He also acknowledged that with the benefit of hindsight he would not have selected Scott Barrett, a lock by trade, in the back row, having taken him off at half-time.He reacted angrily however, when his captain Kieran Read was asked whether New Zealand had been hungry enough to achieve victory. He said: “They’re desperate to win the game, just because I’ve asked them at half-time to get hungrier doesn’t mean they didn’t turn up to be hungry. There’s a big difference and if you want to spend some time outside, I’ll give you a rugby education on that one. To turn up and say that an All Blacks team comes to a semi-final of the Rugby World Cup with the amount of ability and the history that it’s had behind it – that’s a pretty average question, I reckon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe9a73dfa30dc25bc846ab8b5ba61d20ef2036f8/0_119_4793_2875/master/4793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38f6ca63e9a05ee6271c5c070fa87029","title":"england new zealand rugby world cup semi final match report","story":"No one connected with English rugby will ever forget the annus mirabilis of 2003 but finally Martin Johnson and co have some serious competition. While Eddie Jones’s squad may still be 80 minutes short of their ultimate ambition, it is impossible to recall any Red Rose side, ancient or modern, playing better than this.If it sounds faintly unreal to report that New Zealand, the tournament favourites and previously unbeaten in 18 World Cup matches dating back to 2007, could conceivably have been beaten by 30 unanswered points that is the plain, unvarnished truth. The All Blacks’ dreams of becoming the first team to win three consecutive Webb Ellis Cups were not so much dashed on a humid evening as sliced and diced by a bunch of sword-wielding Samurai warriors.Steve Hansen’s side, so dominant in Japan en route to the last four, could cope with neither the extra power at England’s disposal nor their defensive strength and tactical acumen after Manu Tuilagi’s second-minute score had set the spectacular early tone. No need for a super over to settle this particular Anglo-Kiwi sporting contest or a slide-rule to decide where this effort ranked in recent times. Not since that damp Sydney night 16 years ago has English rugby enjoyed a more stunning outcome.Amid all the assorted landmarks – Jones has now become the first coach to secure two World Cup victories over New Zealand and his team are into their first final since 2007 – it was the way England did it that will stick longest in the memory. Their forwards knew they had to play the collective game of their lives and duly did so. Maro Itoje was absolutely everywhere and, along with Tom Curry, Sam Underhill and Courtney Lawes, produced a world-class performance when it mattered most. George Ford, taking over the kicking duties from a limping Owen Farrell, kicked four vital penalties and, when the inevitable All Black fightback belatedly materialised, some of the white shirted tackling, particularly from Underhill, was off the scale.And when it was all over and the crowd had finished belting out Wonderwall and Hey Jude as if the trophy were already heading back to Twickenham, it was instructive to listen to Hansen and his captain, Kieran Read, both acknowledge that New Zealand had been beaten by a better side, pure and simple. Their opponents, furthermore, had two tries disallowed, missed two kickable penalties and a drop goal and gifted the All Blacks their second-half try via a glaring lineout malfunction. Even the unknown inidual supposedly spying on England training in midweek did not see this coming.From the moment England calmly formed their own deliberate V-shaped arrowhead to greet the haka, encroaching slightly into the Kiwi half for extra effect, this was that rarest of beasts, a complete All Black nightmare. Inside 98 seconds England had already made their intentions clear, a superb attacking sequence ending with Tuilagi plunging unstoppably over by the posts. Farrell’s conversion made it 7-0 and it was a full seven minutes before New Zealand could take anything remotely resembling a breath.The sight of the diminutive Ford stripping the startled tighthead Nepo Laulala further symbolised England’s intent and even the multi-talented Beauden Barrett looked rattled. New Zealand were fortunate not to concede a second try when Tuilagi intercepted the full-back’s attempted long pass but Jonny May, who tweaked a hamstring against Australia in the quarter-final, was unable, for once in his high-speed life, to burn off the cover.The All Blacks had another let off when the outstanding Underhill, having collected Kyle Sinckler’s pass, charged over for a potential score which was ruled out on the grounds that Curry’s decoy run had illegally cleared a defender from his path. Only with a limping Farrell clearly in discomfort did England’s momentum slow momentarily but they still spent over two thirds of the opening half in their opponents’ territory and mostly forced New Zealand’s dangerous backs to live off scraps. A 45-metre penalty from Ford extended England’s interval lead to 10-0 and left Hansen and his players staring into oblivion.Even the famously demanding Jones could hardly have wished for more, with his players having followed his prescribed gameplan virtually to the letter. As long ago as last November, after his side’s 16-15 defeat to New Zealand at Twickenham, the head coach was already making clear exactly how England would handle any rematch in Japan. “If you’re prepared to play a certain way against the All Blacks – and you can do it very well – you can make them uncomfortable. That hasn’t changed since Adam was a boy.”The blank first half was noteworthy in itself as the All Blacks’ first at any World Cup since 1991. Their predicament could have been even worse had England not had another potentially match-clinching try ruled out in the 46th minute, this time for a slight knock forward in the preceding maul before Ben Youngs dummied his way over for what would have been an outstanding finish.A 50th-minute penalty from Ford made partial amends, only for an English lineout aberration close to their own line to gift the defiant Ardie Savea a soft 57th-minute try, converted by a subdued Richie Mo’unga.Could the All Blacks, who had previously lost just nine of their 105 Test matches under Hansen, possibly escape and deny England a winner-takes-all date with either South Africa or Wales? The answer was an emphatic no, with two further Ford penalties steering the English chariot sweetly into the final. Play like this next Saturday and they will be unstoppable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62a62c17592f886f398d08b06858694a9963a984/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd7e48624cd7818fd3196996ba7fea9d","title":"immense england fans celebrate defeat of all blacks","story":"Supporters around country and overseas post videos of fans celebrating in pubs and rugby clubsWhen Manu Tuilagi swan-ed over the line within two minutes of England’s World Cup semi-final with New Zealand, their dejected opponents briefly regrouped.But the All Blacks, who had not lost in 18 consecutive World Cup matches since the 2007 quarter-finals, were unable to find a way past an imperious England side who marched into the final as rugby fans at the Cabbage Patch pub near Twickenham roared with delight.The victory provided the news cycle with some respite from Brexit, not least for Boris Johnson, who once famously toppled a Japanese schoolchild during a game of street rugby.He congratulated the team on their “immense effort” and looked forward to the final in Yokohama next Saturday, while the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, also applauded the team and expressed his wish that the final would see England face off against Wales, who play South Africa on Sunday.The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, congratulated the team, writing: “What a game. Well done England Rugby.”Eddie Jones’s team produced a highly impressive performance to see off favourites New Zealand 19-7 and seal a spot in the final, their first appearance since 2007 when they were defeated by South Africa – four years after winning the Webb Ellis cup.England supporters around the country and overseas posted videos of fans celebrating in pubs and rugby clubs. Clips showed fans jumping up and down with joy and singing the England rugby anthem Swing Low Sweet Chariot.Among the famous faces enjoying the occasion was Ross Kemp, who posted a video of himself screaming: “Come on England! Yes, yes, yes. I cannot tell you what that means, It ain’t over yet but we’re pretty close.

Instead of standing in a line, they formed a V with the players on the extremes, Billy Vunipola and Joe Marler, ignoring the orders of the referee, Nigel Owens, and one of his assistants, Pascal Gaüzère, to move back into their own half.They enclosed the All Blacks and did so from the moment the match started when England were not going to take a step backwards for anyone.There was no reverse gear on their chariot and after kicking off to start the match in their opponents’ half, they scored a try after 98 seconds and the holders, who had not lost in the World Cup since 2007 and whose previous defeat to a team that was not hosting the event was in 1999, were unable to formulate a response.It is not often that New Zealand have been out-thought but having opted for four lineout targets in an attempt to control a perceived strength of England they lost the battle on the floor to Tom Curry, who has more than a touch of Richie McCaw about him, and Sam Underhill, while also misfiring in the lineout where Maro Itoje roamed free and when the All Blacks did win a throw sabotaged their maul.New Zealand had little ball to work with and even less that was quick and usable. England were able to narrow the point of their attack but on the few occasions the All Blacks achieved width carriers were ushered into touch in a masterly defensive display.There were times when it looked as if England had an extra man, which given the multidimensional nature of Itoje, a forward who excels at everything he does, they had in a way.Eddie Jones had spent the week generating headlines, from talking about spies to mocking the servile nature of New Zealand’s rugby media. He did not get a rise from his opposite number, Steve Hansen, who played the role of senior statesman at his team announcement on Thursday, but he was not the target.Jones knew everything would be magnified to the point of distortion even a question from a British journalist to Brodie Retallick, asking the second-row if he knew about any more England players than the one he cited in 2014 when he confused him with a New Zealand politician, was blown up into a major story in a trivial pursuit.Whether it had anything to do with Jones’s stirring, New Zealand’s discipline deserted them to the point where Sam Whitelock, one of their senior players, cost them a penalty reversal in the second half when he shoved Owen Farrell in the head with his palm after the whistle had blown. It showed how frustration turned into desperation as the leading team in the world rankings came a distant second in the physical contest where Underhill set the tone by thudding into Kieran Read and bringing the New Zealand captain, who had battered Ireland the week before, to a juddering, instant, match-defining halt.Hansen, who had hoped to end his international coaching career in Saturday’s final rather than Friday’s play-off, was magnanimous in defeat, bridling when a questioner wondered if only England had been hungry for victory. “If you want a rugby education, come outside and I will give you one,” he said. “It is disrespectful to say the All Blacks turned up not feeling hungry. We played a team that was as desperate as heck to win the World Cup and we were not good enough.”Nowhere near good enough. It was New Zealand’s biggest defeat in a match where they did not receive a red card since they lost to England at Twickenham in 2012 and there was an eerie symmetry with one of their other semi-final defeats, to Australia in 2003 in Sydney. The Wallabies were coached by Eddie Jones and in charge of the All Blacks was John Mitchell, now the England defence man.Like England this time, Australia started strongly and scored an early try to go 7-0 ahead. Then it was 10-0 and 13-0 before New Zealand fashioned a try to make it 13-7. Two more Australia penalties followed for a 19-7 scoreline, which is how it finished here.Jones said before that game, as he repeated this week, that to defeat the All Blacks you had to take the game to them from the start, hustle them out of their stride and not let up.Which England did, dominant in defence and enterprising in attack. They had two tries disallowed and three times coughed up possession in their opponents’ 22. It would not have flattered them had they doubled their score and they maintained their concentration at the point in the second half when the holders had to abandon what was left of caution and run everything from everywhere.There were echoes of Japan’s victory over Ireland when Jones said he had been planning for the match for more than two years, when he knew England were on a collision course with New Zealand, while their opponents had had a week to prepare.Hansen acknowledged that and as he left the media conference, he wearily walked down a long corridor arm in arm with Read, nodded at reverentially by local volunteers guarding entrances, two warriors denied a final conquest but whose imprint on the game remains indelible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5f8333d1c3ceef19a6957fae7e13c1a00a09cca/17_75_3451_2071/master/3451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d827a17f16171a52f6c13114312a519","title":"wales george north south africa rugby world cup","story":"By his own admission George North is yet to fire in Japan but with Wales in a World Cup semi-final with South Africa on Sunday morning Warren Gatland will hope his best is yet to come.Gatland is in his last campaign as Wales head coach and only a giant Springbok outfit stand between him and a first final for Wales. To get past the Springboks, Gatland’s battered and bruised side will have to produce their best performance of the tournament and get the best out of their key men.One such man is North. With 39 Wales tries in 90 Tests – at the age of 27 – you cannot really argue with his record, yet there remains a feeling he could do more to help his team.“My form has been mixed,” he said. “This is the biggest stage and where you want to be playing your best rugby. I’ve not been playing badly, but not to where I want to be. We are now in a semi-final and to be part of it is something special.”North featured in Wales’s last World Cup semi-final – 2011’s 9-8 defeat by France at Auckland’s Eden Park – following the dismissal of Sam Warburton.“This one has got a better feeling about it. We’re chuffed to be here and thrilled to be one of the last four standing,” said North. “In 2011, we went into it as a bit of an unknown and got there by sheer determination and belief. This time we’ve earned our place. We’ve got to push on now.“These are the games you do all the hard graft for. They are the ones you’d give anything and everything to be a part of. Everyone in the squad is ready for that challenge.”This Wales team is more experienced, boasts greater depth, and has had more success than the one of 2011 and this is the best shot Wales will have at global glory.Whoever comes out on top in Yokohama on Sunday morning will meet England in the final after Eddie Jones’ side produced a performance for the ages to beat New Zealand 19-7.Wales have won their past four meetings with South Africa. The two sides often meet outside of World Rugby’s designated Test window with the Springboks without a number of their leading players as a result. This time their only big absentee is the injured wing Cheslin Kolbe.Davies and his midfield partner, Hadleigh Parkes, have recovered from knocks but there must be a concern their injuries will count against them in what will a brutal battle.North will win his 91st Wales cap at the International Stadium in Yokohama. He marked his 2010 debut with two tries against the Springboks as an 18-year-old and is now one behind Wales’s second-highest scorer, Gareth Thomas.“It was a dream come true to get a cap for my country. To get two tries on my debut was huge for me. From there I haven’t really stopped and it’s been an amazing journey to get here.“I’ve got an opportunity to face South Africa again, but on a huge stage. We’ve come a long way since 2011, but being able to play in a World Cup semi-final now is huge motivation as it is. It’s something I couldn’t be more excited about.”South Africa’s Siya Kolisi – his country’s first black captain – wants to follow in the footsteps of François Pienaar and John Smit and unite the Rainbow Nation. Their 1995 World Cup success came with Pienaar as captain and he received the Webb Ellis Cup from Nelson Mandela, the country’s first black president, a year after apartheid had ended.It was a seismic moment in the country’s rugby history and more global glory followed in 2007. Now Kolisi wants a final meeting with England, the side beaten in the 2007 showpiece.“We have many different races in our country and 11 different languages,” Kolisi said. “It is one of the positives of our country – it’s really beautiful. That’s why we are called the ‘Rainbow Nation’. When we decide to work together for one goal or as a team and as a country, we can make anything happen and achieve all our dreams.“I am old enough to remember the 2007 World Cup. I remember what it did for the country then and I know what it would do now.“We all know Wales kick a lot of ball so their forwards are quite important. It is going to be a battle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7dfa4833d9b4f2f0c84e847435d48d9ddfaffcf/0_99_4679_2807/master/4679.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1062fc22c362412fbfaec86b73b64fa7","title":"maro itoje england new zealand rugby world cup semi final","story":"They say it used to take the great Japanese swordsmiths a year to forge their finest swords. Eddie Jones spent two and a half crafting the weapon he used to cut up the All Blacks. He had been working on it ever since they announced the draw for this World Cup back in May 2017, heating it, honing it till it had exactly the heft and sharpness it needed for this one specific job. This was the first time England had ever beaten New Zealand in a World Cup, yes, but also only eighth in over a century of Test rugby. You can count off the years: ’36, ’73, ’83, ’93, ’02, ’03, ’12, and now, the most famous of the lot, in 2019.Till this Saturday, there were barely a hundred Englishmen who knew what it took to beat them. Jones, though, had been here before, when he was coaching Australia in 2003 and they beat them 22-10 at this very same stage. He’s always been convinced he knew how to do it. And while this wasn’t his victory, it had his fingerprints all over it. You could see them in the minutes before kick-off, when England lined up into a V formation to face the haka, Owen Farrell at the centre and his 22 teammates in rows either side, the last men in the line standing deep into New Zealand’s half. Nigel Owens asked them to step back. Joe Marler wasn’t having it.The prop shot Owens a filthy grin and held his ground. It was all done to discomfort the All Blacks, to let them know England were going to contest every last little piece of the ground. “New Zealand are the gods of rugby,” Jones said. “We wanted to take it to them, to put them on the back foot as much as we could.” Never forget, he was a niggly, hot-tempered hooker himself in his playing days. And you could see his influence too, in the little ruse England used at the kick-off, when George Ford switched the ball to Farrell at the last minute, and he booted the ball deep the other way to the direction everyone was expecting.That was the feint, they followed it up with an uppercut. That first 20 minutes were England’s best stretch of attacking rugby since Martin Johnson’s side were in their prime. You would need to coin new collective nouns to describe the way England played in that quarter, when they threw a confusion of passes, their hands moving so fast you gasped to watch it, flickering the ball one way and another till it looked like a pinball ricocheting off the flippers. They came at New Zealand from a bewilderment of angles, switching, cutting, dummying, from the left, the right, straight on and every degree in between.Here came Elliot Daly, slipping through tackles, and Anthony Watson, stepping around them, Kyle Sinckler tossing offloads, Jamie George barrelling down the wing, Courtney Lawes charging the hard yards, and Manu Tuilagi ing for the line. The try took 97 seconds. “The team that took the game won the game,” Steve Hansen said later. Or, as Mike Tyson famously put it: “Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the mouth.” It took New Zealand 20 minutes to rediscover their plan but England were a step ahead, and by the time the All Blacks steadied themselves, they had already shifted the emphasis on to their defence.The commonplace wisdom about beating New Zealand is that you need to score a heap of points to do it, because you’ve no chance of shutting them out. Tell that to England’s defence coach, John Mitchell. He should know, since he was the All Blacks head coach for four years. Up in the grandstands, we were all checking the records. Turns out that the last time New Zealand failed to score in the first half was also the last time England beat them, at Twickenham in 2012. And you have to go way back to 1968 to find the last Test they won from that position. At the break, England leading 10-0. Only halfway through, it felt as if they were more than halfway there.Generations from now they will still be talking about some of those tackles. The All Blacks’ grandchildren will still be telling their kids to behave or else Sam Underhill will come and get them. That if they get out of bed he’ll come flying out the wardrobe with his arms spread wide either side ready to knock them clean off their feet, just like he did Kieran Read. They will talk, too, of Tuilagi and Tom Curry and Mako Vunipola, who went rampaging around the field as if they were sacking an enemy village.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterAnd then there was Maro Itoje, who had the game of his life. Itoje has always talked like a man who has had a sense of his own destiny, as he is sure he is bound for great things. On Saturday he achieved them.In numbers Itoje made 12 tackles, won seven lineouts, and three turnovers. But that doesn’t tell you the half of it. He was a one-man highlights reel. You kept catching glimpses of him, forcing his way through the maul to reach over and wrap his hands around the ball to stop Aaron Smith snapping it out, and soaring into the air at the lineout to grab the ball away from Sam Whitelock, and charging into half a gap after Ford tore the ball off Nepo Laulala, and bent double over a tackled man, rooting around with his hands till he pulled up the ball, like some frenzied prospector digging around for the speck of gold he had spotted in the river mud.The try they finally conceded came from a ludicrous error, when George tossed the ball over Itoje and straight to Ardie Savea at a five-metre lineout. It was the flaw that made the rest of it seem all the more perfect. The only way New Zealand could get back into the game was when England let them. And by the end of it all, they were getting so desperate they were giving away turnovers, and penalties, coughing up handling errors.Here were the famous All Blacks, cut to ribbons, and the bits strewn about the pitch under the cold, black night sky. “Sometime’s sports not fair,” Steve Hansen admitted, “but tonight was. We just got beaten by a better side.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9c77c49d696444d52f760b56bdfa8e890261e83/0_196_5383_3230/master/5383.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1e5464dcca69b306fd0b9314db54233","title":"wta finals shenzhen womens tennis richest event history troubling backdrop","story":"Might the WTA Finals’ setting cast a pall over the profound symbolism of the most lucrative event in the sport’s history?As Hong Kong marched for an 11th consecutive week in August, 20 miles away a drone floated noiselessly over the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre. It captured coordinated teams of men running across the lush grass-painted lines of a football pitch, but there were no footballs in sight. Instead, dozens of paramilitary vehicles from China’s People’s Armed Police paraded the streets of Shenzhen and settled in the arena. Satellite pictures showed more than 100 sitting tidily around the perimeter of the pitch. The military exercises were widely perceived to be an intimidation tactic, to show what China could do in Hong Kong if it really wanted to. Sports and politics were in perfect harmony.There will be none of those vehicles on show at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre. Instead, the eight best women’s tennis players and doubles teams in the world have descended on the complex as the WTA Finals comes to Shenzhen for the first time.Pound for pound, it is essentially the most lucrative tennis event in history – men’s or women’s. The figures are astonishing: the total prize money stands at $14m (£10.75m), far outstripping the $8m on offer by the ATP’s equivalent event at the O2 Arena in London. If undefeated, the champion will take home $4.725m compared with the record $3.8m pocketed by the US Open champions this year.Steve Simon, the WTA’s CEO, has said: “There was a true commitment here, trying to do something about ‘walking the walk’ when it comes to women’s empowerment. It made a huge impression on us when we saw someone who didn’t just talk the talk.”It is clearly a symbolic moment: women being paid more than men, slowly gaining even more access to the money usually reserved for male athletes.In a sport governed from top to bottom by men, female players had long grown accustomed to competing for fractions of the prize money gifted to their male colleagues.Just before the 1970 US Open, the tennis promoter Jack Kramer offered the men prize money of $12,500 and the women $1,500 for the Pacific Southwest Championships in California. Women who failed to reach the quarter-finals would earn nothing but he implored them to play for the love of the game.It was an insult too far. As Kramer threatened to banish them from his US Lawn Tennis Association and their status in other major events came under fire, a group of players led by King risked everything by choosing to boycott his event in favour of forming their own tour.In 1973, the Virginia Slims Circuit made way for the WTA Tour and soon became the machine that now makes millionaires on a monthly basis. On the day the “Original Nine” announced that they would boycott Kramer’s event, they signed a contract worth $1 and each held up a dollar bill to the sky.It can be easy to forget just how big women’s tennis is. In an intolerant world where even its greatest player, Serena Williams, still receives scorn for the audacity of being an athlete with muscles, women’s tennis is a triumph. For the past 49 years, it has been the largest women’s sport – nothing else comes close. On the Forbes list of highest-paid female athletes this year, the top 11 names are tennis players. On and off the court, the WTA has proven capable of generating transcendent superstars and delivering profound cultural moments.None of those moments have been more pivotal to recent WTA history than the rise of Li Na, the charismatic Chinese player who broke away from the centralised tennis system and became a champion. Her triumphs at the French Open in 2011 and the Australian Open in 2014 made small ripples in the west but in China she reshaped the sporting scene in her image.The WTA has since spent more than half a decade pushing hard into China. It now has offices in Beijing and holds nine tournaments in the country, while eight remain in the United States. One day at a Chinese tournament makes it clear why. Their Chinese partners do not think small with each new event comes a towering new stadium and vast sums from major sponsors to tennis projects stretching far beyond the tournament.While the WTA was in the midst of a mammoth eight weeks in China, the way people speak about the country’s rising presence in world sporting events shifted. When the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, tweeted his support for the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, China’s incensed reaction pushed the league into an international incident. China promised retribution and has acted, most recently refusing to show the opening game of the NBA season.The NBA’s attempts to simultaneously appease China and the US has garnered criticism across the board. The widespread attempts for sporting leagues to capitalise on the capital China possesses has come under greater scrutiny, and there are few sporting bodies navigating China as zealously as the WTA.The saga should be a point of reflection for the WTA, in part because, unlike most other sporting leagues, it is an organisation born out of fighting oppression and the status quo, and its foundations are about much more than just tennis.Taking the big money from a country with an authoritarian government will always come at a cost and presenting its business decision in terms of empowerment is unreasonable as long as Hong Kong burns next door and Uighur Muslims are being sent to re-education camps on the other side of the country.One reason Chinese municipal governments are so willing to collaborate with the WTA is because it is an opportunity to project the best of their cities on to the big stage. Between random beautiful camera shots of the city’s skyline, Shenzhen will showcase an exciting period for the WTA as young players such as Naomi Osaka, Bianca Andreescu and Ashleigh Barty continue to form new rivalries and contest thrilling matches. They may just be thrilling enough for viewers to forget momentarily what is happening 20 miles away and the tanks that lined up in the city weeks earlier. For the city government, that is probably the point.The WTA has unwittingly landed in the middle of the biggest sports politics story of the year, but that was its choice. More stories like this one will unfold over the next weeks, months and years. Questions will be asked of where the WTA stands and how much its money means to it. The organisation will be judged accordingly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893dfe641d6a71ad69a5ed05c34d5df275d905ee/0_48_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c7444ac3bba8eda789e9edd8836e751","title":"facebook fact checkers paid adverts misinformation mark zuckerberg congress","story":"Many third-party contractors learned of new policy from Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony to Congress Many of Facebook’s third-party fact checkers have still not been told that the company now expects them to vet adverts as well as user content for misinformation – though, controversially, not political adverts.Some fact checkers only found out that they should be vetting paid adverts after Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg described the new policyin Congress on Wednesday.Until August, Facebook’s third-party fact checkers, all of whom are independent organisations and members of Poynter’s International Fact-Checking Network, were appointed by the company to only vet content posted to social network by users. The companies receive a fee for the work, and use tools built by Facebook to find claims posted to the site and mark them as true or false. Other flags, including satire, false headline, and “mixture”, are also available.But a policy update published late this summer allowed fact checkers to flag false adverts for the first time. The new policy was introduced quietly by the company, and initially noticed for the effect it had on political adverts: fact checkers are not allowed to vet content posted by political candidates, and so those adverts can never be taken down for misinformation.But the ability to vet adverts at all is a new feature for fact checkers, and one some of them are not entirely comfortable with. When a user post is marked false by a fact checker, it gets flagged as such on the site, and shared to fewer users as a result, but it does not get removed from view entirely – a conscious decision on the part of Facebook and fact checkers, who do not want to be accused of censorship.But Facebook’s policy about non-political advertising is sharper: the company prohibits adverts marked false. “We disapprove ads that contain content rated false, which means these ads can’t run,” Facebook says in a help document, updated in early September according to the Internet Archive.“Several of us really don’t want that power,” one fact checker told the . “One of my first questions is, why are you now giving us powers to remove content when you haven’t before? I would argue you’re opening up yourselves to liability. That’s just a Pandora’s box in my opinion.”Facebook says Libra is a \u0027global currency and financial infrastructure\u0027 - a digital asset built by Facebook and powered by a new Facebook-created version of blockchain, the encrypted technology used by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the £ symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra.Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account.Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the \u0027Libra Association\u0027. It functions as what is known as a \u0027stablecoin\u0027, pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions.Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(£8m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHowever in October 2019 several of the companies that had been backing the initiative announced that they were pulling out, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Stripe.With regulators asking questions and backing companies dropping out, it is unclear now if Libra is still viable.

Others found out watching Zuckerberg in front of Congress, when Congresswoman Maxine Waters asked him: “Do you fact check on any ads at all?”, and he answered “Yes”.“They added language to the guide without telling us,” another fact checker said. “We had to check previous versions to find out when.”Facebook declined to comment.

The Pentagon has said it planned to award future cloud deals to multiple contractors.This week, the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, removed himself from reviewing the deal because of his adult son’s employment with one of the original contract applicants, IBM Corp. IBM had previously bid for the contract but had already been eliminated from the competition.In a statement announcing Microsoft as the winner, the Pentagon underscored its view that the competition was conducted fairly and legally.In a statement, an Amazon Web Services spokesman said the company was “surprised about this conclusion”. The company said “detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings” would “clearly lead to a different conclusion”, according to the statement.The Pentagon said it had awarded more than $11bn across 10 separate cloud contracts over the past two years.“As we continue to execute the DOD cloud strategy, additional contracts are planned for both cloud services and complementary migration and integration solutions necessary to achieve effective cloud adoption,” the Pentagon said.

From travel apps and carbon calculators to free public transport, here’s how you can make a differenceIndustry experts believe that a nationwide transport revolution is required to mitigate the climate crisis, and that smart technology could transform the way we travel. Travel apps are making sustainable transport options more accessible to the growing number of people keen to change their travel plans to reduce their environmental impact.Tools include the calculator at EcoPassenger, which directly compares energy consumption and carbon emissions of planes, cars and trains for any journey. Meanwhile, Lime’s new electric bike and scooter sharing scheme is taking off in London and Milton Keynes, and Europe’s leading train and coach app, Trainline, is making greener travel more hassle-free for customers globally by investing in technology to help make train and coach travel across 45 countries more accessible. “Our long-term vision is to enable everyone to travel from A to B much faster and more efficiently, in a way that’s better for the environment,” says Clare Gilmartin, CEO of Trainline. “We use artificial intelligence and advanced mobile technology so that, via our app, customers can travel by train and coach seamlessly, with on-the-go access to real-time journey information, using digital tickets to skip queues and with access to clever features like BusyBot, which harnesses crowdsourced data to help people find a seat on a busy train. We believe smart tech has a crucial role to play in encouraging and enabling people to travel sustainably.”The government has invested £1.5bn in grants between 2015 and 2020 for electric plug-in vehicles and schemes to kickstart the rollout of charge-point infrastructure, while pledging that all new cars and vans should be zero-emission by 2040, according to its Road to Zero strategy. Childs insists this is not enough: “The only way we can make the scale of reductions we need fast enough is by having a revolution in transportation.”Lisbon has one of the world’s largest electric vehicle charging point networks, while Estonia and Luxembourg have introduced countrywide free public transport. “Free public transport is transformational, not only for the environment – it’s also socially progressive,” adds Childs. Trainline found that a quarter of young Brits would reduce time behind the wheel to be more sustainable, and Friends of the Earth is calling for the government to make bus travel free to under-30s to reduce the need for young people to buy cars and help people switch to public transport.By driving positive change through technology, travel apps help create a more sustainable and efficient transport infrastructure, enabling a smoother transition to lower carbon-impact travel, within the UK and beyond.Book travel in and across 45 countries today with Trainline, Europe’s leading train and coach app"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c0f14c375f014dbb2e32b4cec28918b11daf77/227_320_4836_2902/master/4836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeeecb8be7305c2efcd9f68dd033bfb7","title":"rail adventures five scenic european journeys to savour","story":"With train travel often more sustainable than driving or flying, now’s the time to leave the car at home. Swap the road for the rails, as Nick Inman provides some of the best train trips in the UK and mainland EuropeRail’s sustainability credentials mean it’s a no-brainer to swap the stress of the airport and traffic jams for the more scenic and greener option. With Europe’s extensive rail network ready to take you directly from city centre to city centre or guide you through some of the best scenery on offer, forget flying or driving, hop on the train. You could stay in Britain and explore unfamiliar parts of the country you don’t normally get to see, or you could take the Eurostar from London to mainland Europe and connect with an international system of high-speed trains and quaint branch lines.Rail is convenient, competitively priced and environmentally friendly. It’s also a reminder that travel is as much about the journey as the destination. It allows you to slow down and think.What are you waiting for?Here are five routes – two at home, three abroad – to get you started. All can be booked through Trainline’s app or website.Glasgow to Mallaig via Fort WilliamIf you want to get kids used to travelling by train, take them north to see the magnificent curving viaduct of Glenfinnan, which is used to carry the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The West Highland line is regularly described as one of the most scenic in the British Isles, if not the world (beating even the Trans-Siberian), being a procession of mouthwatering lochs, moors and mountains. From Mallaig you can take ferries to several of the islands of the Inner Hebrides.Getting to Glasgow: you have a choice of trains from London (or other mainline stations in Britain).Typical journey time: Glasgow to Mallaig, 5 hours 16 minutes direct.Nice (Provence, France) to Pisa (Tuscany, Italy)Steep wooded hills tumble into the sea all along the beautiful coast of Liguria from the French border near Ventimiglia to the ancient port city of Genoa and beyond. This trip makes a relaxing way to get to Tuscany along the Riviera. If you are tempted to break up the journey, you may want to visit the resorts of San Remo or Portofino, or one of the dramatically sited and colourful towns of the Cinque Terre.Getting to Nice: take the Eurostar and change at Paris Gare du NordParis Gare de Lyon.Typical journey time: 6 hours 30 minutes, with one or two changes at Ventimiglia andor Genova.Vienna to Klagenfurt via the Semmering PassThis trans-Alpine line was built in 1854 to link the capital of imperial Austria with the Mediterranean. It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey.To get to Vienna: take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt.Typical journey time: Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct.Leeds to Carlisle via SettleIt has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed.Getting to Leeds: there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London.Typical journey time: Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct.Cologne to MainzFancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge – only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen. The east bank line is more scenic, but not as well-serviced as the western side, which has a wider choice of trains – so take the west-bank mainline through Bonn. Or, if you don’t mind taking a slightly more circuitous route, you could go down one and back up the other. Either way, en route are innumerable magnificent castles – whether real, mock or ruined – and pretty villages with half-timbered houses.To get to Cologne: take the Eurostar from London St Pancras and change at Brussels.Typical journey time: Cologne to Mainz, 1 hour 40 minutes.Journey times and ticket prices vary according to which particular options you choose.Ticket to rideIt is easy to book the train for your next adventure.

But only one has Bradley Walsh barking historical facts at you a mile a minuteBradley Walsh, host of The Chase (every day until the end of time, 5pm, ITV) has a curious ability to pull out the very tendrils of someone’s soul with three slithering little questions: what do you do for a living? what do you do for fun? and, what would you do with the money if you won today? Bradley Walsh is able to gauge the very essence of man merely by asking what they’d do if they won about four grand.I sometimes wonder how I would fare under the Walsh magnifying glass: “I’m a writer, Brad,” I’d say, as he twinkles at me. “And what do you do for fun?” “I have no discernible hobbies of which to speak,” I’d tell him. Bradley Walsh would look at the camera. A murmur from the audience. “And what would you do if you won the money today?” And I would say: “I have all the trainers and coats I need, Bradley. And no matter how much I earn over the course of a lifetime I will never buy a flat. Those are the only three things I have any ambition to buy. So if you gave me four grand today I would do literally nothing with it. I am, essentially, post-money. This whole endeavour is a waste of time.” And Bradley Walsh would turn and say: “Let’s win you that post-money.”The Chase, now a decade-defining 10 years old, is part of the furniture of daytime. Every day, four contestants – with the inter-team rapport of a group of people on the same stranded rail-replacement bus who all decide to complain to the driver at once – join forces to try and win up to £150,000. They never do. This is because the conditions of The Chase – a futuristic prison of blue and black studio lights, a looming Quiz Champion (the Chaser) atop a ramp, ticking clocks – conspire to make them forget, say, how many world wars there have been, or what oxygen is.Among so many bombastic daytime TV quiz formats – Tipping Point, Tenable – what makes The Chase so special is the gentle build to a massive, adrenaline-pump climax. There is no better thrill available on TV. Once contestants have answered softball questions in the Cash Builder round they then head-off against the Chaser to add money to the collective pot: those who make it back to the team unscathed get to humiliate themselves in the final, where the aforementioned Chaser – usually a man called “The Beast” – out-answers them by exactly one question and wipes out their jackpot entirely.Adding to the tension is Walsh. For much of the programme he’s a friend, a confidant: contestants call him “Brad”, they apologise to him when they get a question wrong. He seems to be the last quizmaster working today who genuinely doesn’t know the answers to the questions he’s asking. That’s until that last round, when he becomes a quick-fire question hound: he spits out historical facts, wordplay, sporting teasers. The teams are suddenly baffled. The game is lost.And then, tomorrow, the cycle begins anew: what do you do for a living? What would you do with the money if you win? And Bradley Walsh turns to me, and says: “And what do you do for fun?” And I whisper: “I watch The Chase, Bradley Walsh. I watch The Chase.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f739421995bb6d4394380880d55d3cf605c74eed/0_1_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa8bf25299f2f0b052e54c2151c41abd","title":"ryan murphy american horror story pose politician glee nip tuck","story":"With hit series like Pose, Glee and American Horror Story, he brought marginalised characters to the masses. Meet TV’s most powerful man It is a rainy Friday morning on an unprepossessing street in the Bronx. Step inside the squat, utilitarian collection of buildings, however, and it’s a very different story. Statuesque, extravagantly coiffed figures strut about the corridors in wigs, sequins and retro block-colour suits. Elsewhere, lithe dancers in garish-glamorous leisurewear languidly limber up, presided over by MC Pray Tell (recent Emmy winner Billy Porter), in an extravagant ensemble befitting a pearly king. In the middle of it all, underneath the biggest disco ball imaginable, is powerhouse television hit-maker Ryan Murphy.We are on the set of Pose, Murphy’s flamboyant drama (co-created with long-term collaborator Brad Falchuk) set in the New York underground ballroom scene of the late 1980s, and his latest bid to capture the zeitgeist through a story from the recent past. Murphy’s 2018 mega-deal with Netflix sealed his title as “the most powerful man in TV”, but he has earned his crown creating groundbreaking shows both about and starring people whom TV has traditionally ignored.Before the first episode even aired, Pose was already making history, with five of the leads – Indya Moore, Mj Rodriguez, Dominique Jackson, Hailie Sahar and Angelica Ross – played by transgender women, and another 45 trans performers cast in the wider ensemble, the most ever in a scripted television show. Season two jumps forward 18 months to the summer of 1990, when Madonna’s Vogue was No 1 in the charts, and ballroom culture was going mainstream. Yet it was also a time when New York’s LGBTQ community was hit by the HIVAids emergency.“I was interested in the idea of a community in crisis and under siege,” says Murphy, who is also directing today’s episode. “The medications that have helped stop the plague, the holocaust, came out in 1996, so I hope to end the show right as that happened, to really show the decimation of a world.”A self-declared “gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket”, Murphy has always been drawn to the margins. And, difficult though it may be to recall, there once was a time when – rather than the man who, last February, signed a whopping $300m deal with Netflix – he was “somebody who couldn’t sell a script and was being told that everything I did was too gay or too out-there”. The feedback did not cause him to deviate from his vision. “I only wrote or created shows that I really wanted to watch, so they inevitably had gay characters and trans characters and minorities,” he says. “And I made them the leads instead of the sidekicks, because that is what I did in my own life.”Murphy, 53, has been writing for a living since his late teens, first working as an entertainment journalist before moving into screenwriting in the late 1990s with the teen comedy Popular. He truly came to prominence, however, with NipTuck, his dark psychological comedy set in a plastic-surgery practice. Since then, he has indisputably changed the industry, taking mainstream his offbeat celebration of the camp with high-school pep-squad musical comedy-drama Glee, teen murder mystery Scream Queens, and the miniseries Feud: Bette and Joan, a colourful dramatisation of the rivalry between Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon) and Joan Crawford (Jessica Lange) during the making of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?. If that wasn’t enough, Murphy is also responsible for popularising the much-imitated anthology format both with the twisted American Horror Story, which features a rotating cast of Murphy regulars (Sarah Paulson, Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates) in a range of ghoulish setups, and the ripped-from-the-headlines American Crime Story, which has earned acclaim for its retelling of the OJ Simpson trial and the 1997 murder of Gianni Versace.But, beyond the colourful content and genre-busting approach to format, what makes Murphy most notable is what his collaborator, the writer, producer and director Janet Mock – with Pose, the first trans woman of colour in the writers’ room of a Hollywood television series, and also the first to direct an episode of a TV show – calls “showrunning as advocacy”. With his radical, pro-LGBTQ hiring policies and representation, Murphy is changing the face of the industry, on both sides of the camera.With Pose, he says, “the whole theme of the show is: what does it feel like when you are invited to the party, when you suddenly have a place at the table? And what does it feel like when that invitation is then taken away? Look at the world we live in, and look at who our president is. A lot of us thought that we had made it – Obama was president! – but no. Those rights are now more fragile than ever.”He is more than happy to admit that his shows are political, and that their mission is to educate as much as entertain. “There is not a lot of LGBTQ history out there I grew up knowing nothing,” he says. “In the first episode of season two, we introduce a place called Hart Island, which I’d never heard of, an island off Manhattan where the bodies of thousands of people who had died of Aids were put on shipping containers and buried in mass graves.” They recreated the island for the show. “That’s a powerful thing to put out into the world.”When Murphy sleeps is anyone’s guess alongside season two of Pose, this year has also seen the release of The Politician, his first original show for Netflix, starring Ben Platt and Gwyneth Paltrow. Murphy has said that the show cost as much as The Crown to make, part of a commitment on his part to do things that are “big and commercial, fun and shiny”. His tone, which he describes as “baroque”, is anything but subtle, and tends to ide critics – this newspaper called American Horror Story “the Marmite of TV shows”, and The Politician has taken some flak for its frantic and somewhat artificial style.Whatever Murphy creates, it tends to stir conversation or controversy. He is currently working on the next instalment of the American Crime Story anthology: Impeachment, which will tackle the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal and the subsequent impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton. In something of a coup, Lewinsky herself has signed on to be a producer, part of an attempt by the former White House intern to “fully reclaim my narrative”. As if the series wasn’t controversy-courting enough, its release date is scheduled for autumn 2020, smack in the middle of US election season. (Murphy, apparently surprised by the backlash to the proposed date, has said that he has “not committed yet on when we’re going to release it”.)Less controversially, Murphy is also adapting pioneering LGBTQ Broadway play The Boys in the Band into a Netflix film to air next year. “The stuff I always wanted to make, now, mainstream companies will step up and give you millions of dollars to do,” he says. “They know there’s an audience for this, and they will show up. That is a very big difference from when I was starting out, when I wasn’t allowed to even write a gay character.”And it’s not just him – the Murphy effect is tangible. “More and more showrunners, writers, networks, are taking people who are marginalised and making them the leads,” he notes. “These people have gone from being sidekicks at best to being captains of their own story. And that’s significant.”Bette and Dot Tattler American Horror StorySarah Paulson has long been an AHS MVP, but in Freak Show she was required to play conjoined twins one of them introvert and one of them extrovert. Hijinks ensue.Sam Evans GleeIf you left Glee behind after season one, you will have missed dumb-haired Funko Pop doll Sam forming a band called the Justin Bieber Experience.

On the left, the ancient Greek ruins of Solunto on the right, the splendid Arab-Norman city of Cefalù. In the centre, a crystalline sea as blue as the sky.For twenty years, Sicily’s most powerful mafia bosses plotted the murders of countless policemen and politicians from this spot, part of a 400 sq metre villa in the coastal resort town of Casteldaccia, known as the Miami of Sicilian mobsters, a few kilometres from Palermo.But the godfathers are now gone and in their place is Gianluca Calì, an anti-mafia businessman who is about to turn their former stronghold into a holiday house.The villa, hidden among low walls and vegetation, has been vacant for almost 25 years, despite investigators’ suspicions that the premises may have continued to serve as a drugs and weapons deposit or a hiding place for kidnapping victims. The estate even has its own dock a luxury reserved for a tiny minority of the island’s inhabitants. Mafia bosses could freely dock their boats a few metres from the villa, or make an easy escape in case of a police raid.Work is currently underway. In a few weeks, the villa will be equipped to receive up to 32 guests among its 24 rooms. The mafia is still remembered, but with a twist – in the living room hangs an iconic anti-mafia photo of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, the two magistrates killed in 1992 after their investigation of the Sicilian mafia, known colloquially as Cosa Nostra (our thing), led to the arrest of hundreds of mobsters.Calì, 46, knows the mafia too. The owner of a car dealership, he can count the number of vehicles he has had torched in the last 9 years. “Around ten,” he says, smiling nervously.His problems began at the end of 2010, a few months before the purchase of the villa, when a successful year of used car sales did not go unnoticed in Casteldaccia. “Two members of the local mafia family came to our office and told my brother that they needed cash to pay for the clan’s legal expenses. It was a request for protection money. We refused and shortly thereafter they torched the first car.”Calì reported the incident to the police and decided to invest part of his profits in a villa on the coast of Casteldaccia that was going up for auction.He had no idea that the previous owner had been Michele “The Pope” Greco, the boss of bosses of Cosa Nostra and, for several years, the head of a group of leading mobsters called the Sicilian Mafia Commission.Greco had purchased the land in 1965 and built his summer residence there two years later. He hadn’t chosen the site by chance. Next door lived the boss Pietro Vernengo, AKA “Bazooka Eyes”, a multiple murderer who had dissolved some of his victims in acid. Fifty metres away lived Stefano Bontade, one of the most powerful Sicilian mafia bosses, later gunned down on his birthday in 1981.Greco used to hold summit meetings of the Sicilian Mafia Commission in the villa, planning some of the most infamous murders in Italian history. The killing of Pio La Torre, an Italian communist party leader who proposed a law making Mafia association a crime, was ordered on the terrace. The murder of General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, sent as prefect to Sicily to combat the mafia, was commissioned by the bosses while relaxing in the living room the same year.But by the time Calì realised that the villa, acquired for the low price of €240,000, had belonged to “The Pope”, it was too late.“The police informed me that if I had turned back, leaving the villa in the hands of Greco’s heirs, I could have been accused of abetting the mafia.“His heirs came to visit me a few days later, in 2010, to tell me it would be better if I got out of the way. It was a blatant threat. That’s when something clicked. I had already been through the first arson attacks for refusing to pay protection money, but I was determined not to let them win. I then decided to transform the villa into an anti-mafia museum and a vacation home for tourists.”Calì, moved to Milan in the meantime and says he lost count of the threats. In 2014, a local mafia boss, now a police informant, stated that he had decided to shoot Calì with a .45 calibre pistol that year. Fortunately the police arrested him a few days later.Calì sleeps with a gun under his pillow and drives an armoured car, but he says he has not given up. His extortionist, the mafia boss Antonino Virruso, was sentenced to 11 years in prison last September. A sign on the villa gate reads: “In the house, the Mafia has lost”.If you ask him whether the guests will be safe spending the night there, after the hardships suffered by himself and his family, Calì points to the dozens of security cameras. “The only time someone tried to break in, in 2014, an arrest was made the following day.“There is also law enforcement, who patrol this area and protect me and my customers. The mafia and the Grecos shouldn’t frighten anyone,” he adds.Michele Greco was arrested in 1986. He joined hundreds of other defendants in a large anti-mafia trial that lasted six years and became known as the Maxi-Trial. Greco was charged with ordering 78 murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison in 2008, two years before Calì bought the villa.The men who orchestrated his downfall are the same two depicted in the photo now hanging inside.“I could care less what Greco must be thinking from hell about what has become of his villa,” says Calì. “But I’m confident that, from heaven, Falcone and Borsellino, just like in that photo, are doubled over in laughter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afc9d795838ab9c83d2028736c05fbf98191f2a5/0_144_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=264c70986497296e4827c5e32d720705","title":"tourism industry counts cost after separatist riots blight barcelona","story":"Catalonia has been counting the political cost after protests swept across the region following the decision by Spain’s supreme court to impose heavy sentences on Catalan separatist leaders found guilty of sedition. Now it faces a new cost – a slump in the lucrative tourist business in its hugely popular capital, Barcelona.The violent disturbances left the city with a clean-up bill estimated at €3m (£2.6m), but it is feared that the images of airport chaos, running battles with police and flaming barricades will cost a great deal more.Manel Casals, head of the Barcelona hoteliers association, said there had been cancellations and the number of bookings was down. The same is happening with Airbnb and similar platforms. According to AirDNA, a consultancy for the short-term rental sector, reservations for the week from 14 October were down by nearly 1,000 on a year earlier, at 11,537.Barcelona is also one of the world’s most popular conference venues. The biggest money-spinner is the Mobile World Conference. Last year the 100,000 visitors to the telecoms congress spent €473m while creating 14,000 temporary jobs. Its contract with the city expires in 2023.“Conferences are organised a long way in advance, and aside from an American convention I don’t know of any cancellations,” said Christoph Tessmar, director of the Barcelona tourism convention bureau. But he warned: “The images we’ve seen in recent days could have a negative impact in the short term.”Barcelona is also the cruise capital of the Mediterranean. At least three vessels carrying a total of 6,000 passengers opted not to dock in the city. According to the government, ports, railways and airports between them have lost around €4m. Altogether, about 175,000 travellers were affected by cancellations or delays caused by road blocks.For now, everyone is banking on Barcelona’s famed resilience. In 2017, when the city was rocked by both a terrorist attack and the illegal declaration of independence, thousands of businesses moved their headquarters out of Catalonia. However, the city bounced back.“These events can damage the city’s image but this conflict isn’t going to continue for ever and we’ll get back to normal,” said Gabriel Jené, president of Barcelona Oberta. “We’re more worried about the ability of politicians to deal with the conflict than the capacity of the city to overcome it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ae70ef58abe3dd35a81a4207665479d459e882/0_232_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73e5666fdaec9e39d98eb965806e30e4","title":"well be ok all blacks fans take world cup defeat on the chin","story":"Despondent supporters in southern town of Wanaka say it will take time to recover but ‘life will go on’It had been 12 years and 20 days since the All Blacks had last lost a game at the Rugby World Cup. In New Zealand, there was some complacency: do or die sure, but who could challenge the world’s greatest rugby team?At the Bullock Bar in Wanaka, a small farming and tourist town in the alps of the South Island, the mood was sombre at half time, and turned black as the end approached. Not good enough, not fast enough, not World Cup winners.Outside a storm blew in, the wind sharp and jarring, as World Cup glory stormed out of reach.Gareth Lewis, 44, short, stocky, a lifelong fan, wore his All Blacks jersey skin tight. At the conclusion of the match, as the Bullock Bar emptied quietly and in record-time, his eyes were moist, his expression stunned.“I’m pretty despondent. But England deserved to win. They outplayed us,” he said.“It’s like our religion here. We’re not a country of faith strongly, rugby is what brings us all together, you know? It’s like the glue that keeps New Zealand together. When we lose it’s tough, it’s hard work.”Lewis said it would take him a few days – at least – to recover from the shock defeat.“She’ll be a long old night. But we’ll have a laugh tomorrow. Like George Gregan said – four more years, you know, we can have another crack.”Otago University sports psychologist Steve Jackson said while many Kiwis would be experiencing genuine feelings of sadness about the loss, 2019 had been a trying year already, and the nation was well equipped to swiftly move on.“Kiwis will be disappointed but those who know rugby will accept they were beaten by a better team,” Jackson said.New Zealand’s sport and recreation minister, Grant Robertson, was in Yokohama for the game. A lifelong All Blacks fan, he tweeted gracious defeat.“The better team won on the night. England accurate in every facet of game. Our lads didn’t fire. ABs still have a lot to be proud of but just not to be #allblacks.”In Wanaka, as Kiwis put down their drinks and headed to the 247 grocery store for mince pies and small buckets of chips instead, sadness was matched by pragmatism, following the lead of All Blacks coach Steve Hanson, who praised England’s “tremendous” footy.“Tonight we just weren’t good enough,” Hansen said.“And we’ve got to take that on the chin – as does everybody back home.”Dave Reed, 60, of Canterbury, quietly nursed a beer at the bar, staring dumbstruck at the screen as England celebrated – demurely, politely – at Yokohama stadium.“I’m very sad, I’m pretty gutted. But England deserved to win. I’m an All Black through and through but they deserved to win. Definitely. The All Blacks didn’t turn up today. They didn’t let us play. We never got to play today, did we?”Like many at the bar, Reed wondered if England needed this win now more than New Zealand. “I mean, they’ve got Brexit right? They’ve got that Boris guy in charge? Damn. Maybe they need this, who wouldn’t need this with what they’ve got going on up there? We’ll be ok.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Family said the specially adapted wheelchair was Kyle\u0026rsquos (6) only mode of transportPolice investigating line of inquiry to establish if \u0026lsquowider conspiracy\u0026rsquo is involved with deathsParty leader tells conference DUP open to doing deal on Irish languageOliver O\u0026rsquoGrady previously jailed for possessing nearly 280,000 child pornography imagesSiptu members are in dispute over working conditions and union recognitionGreen Flag awards for parks are judged by experts and assessed on eight strict criteriaToo often DUP has played into its \u0026lsquoenemies\u0026rsquo hands\u0026rsquo, says Emma Little-PengellyMoney was found during intelligence-led searches in north Dublin this weekAssaults on Mary Manning by Sean McDarby lead to the births of her five childrenThree further Irish suspects detained by Essex policeState engagement with local communities on hosting and direct provision to be studiedDUP annual conference: Time to get out the woolly hats for winter election canvassing?Trailer made two return trips from Britain to Europe before discoveryMan (60) arrested during intelligence-led searches in north DublinDUP leader calls Taoiseach\u0026rsquos warnings over republican activity in a hard Brexit \u0026lsquowrong\u0026rsquoPeople urged to avoid illegal fires and fireworks on October 31st due to risks to lifeJohn Boylan purchased stake in Labaik for \u0026euro28,000Eighteen-year-old scales 13ft wall in German jail to get to his former partner\u0026rsquos windowFour MEPs voted against Mediterranean search and rescue resolution over one clause"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4063959.1572096957!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gosafe says speeding enforcement operating at 78 during strike","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe  strike by Siptu members will last from 9am on Saturday  to 9am on Tuesday. Photograph: The Irish TimeGoSafe has said up to 78 per cent of its speed enforcement capacity is operational on Saturday despite a strike by some staff at the company. A planned 72-hour work stoppage by Siptu members employed at GoSafe began at 9am on Saturday in a dispute related to working conditions and union recognition at the company. GoSafe said they “moved early” to ensure disruption caused by the stoppage will be “minimised” and said its speed cameras will be operational over the bank holiday weekend. “In addition to the enhanced enforcement presence, up to 70 per cent of safety camera monitoring sessions are operational, ensuring cover is in place for the full weekend,” a spokeswoman said. This was later revised upwards to 78 per cent for speed enforcement operations on Saturday. Management at Go Safe said on Thursday that it had reached a proposed agreement with its internal staff representative body on pay and rosters.However, Siptu said the proposed agreement between Go Safe and the internal representative association at the company had nothing to do with the union. It said the planned stoppage would go ahead.Siptu has urged management at GoSafe to adhere to a Labour Court recommendation stating that the company should recognise the union as the representative of its employees who are members and negotiate with it to resolve their legitimate concerns about conditions.Gardaí are carrying out high visibility patrols and checkpoints across the country this country. They have appealed to motorists not to drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs and to reduce speed. Enforcement activities will specifically target and focus on off-peak hours (10pm to 6am).

Responsible lending is much needed in these difficult times for the UK economy.”David Fisher, chief executive of Cash Euro Net’s parent company Enova International, blamed the FOS for QuickQuid’s collapse.“Over the past year and a half, we have experienced a challenging and uncertain regulatory environment in the UK, despite the fact that the FCA reviewed and approved our business practices and affordability criteria in 2015,” he said.“The FOS has continued to move the goalposts with its complaints handling decisions, in effect setting ever-changing de facto policies that in many instances was inconsistent with FCA guidelines.”People who have outstanding loans with QuickQuid are advised to continue making repayments as normal.“If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating,” said Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service.“Eleven and a half million adults have less than £100 in savings and investments so lots of people face cash-flow problems which can make quick, short-term credit feel like the only option.\u0026nbsp“If you know you need a specific amount of money for a short while there may be more affordable alternatives out there, so it’s a good idea to shop around before you borrow.”The Money Advice Service website has a guide on alternatives to payday loans, and you can also contact a free helpline on 0800 138 7777Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as chief executive but was still WeWork\u0027s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on 6 October, the sources said.The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management chief executive Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.With questions swirling around WeWork\u0027s chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.Created with Sketch.Tech giants to be hit by new tax in France Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018A few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork\u0027s largest shareholder, Japan\u0027s SoftBank.Both were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.This account of how WeWork\u0027s financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.SoftBank offered $9.5bn\u0026nbspto WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company\u0027s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann\u0027s controlling grip.SoftBank\u0027s deal would strip Neumann\u0027s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China\u0027s Hony Capital, for the company\u0027s precipitous decline, some of the people said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork\u0027s lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.The problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as chief executive\u0026nbspon 24 September because, as WeWork\u0027s founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.WeWork staff outraged at former CEO’s payout while they face job cutsIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann\u0027s personal borrowings made against WeWork\u0027s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970m of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.SoftBank\u0027s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9bn based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.Neumann\u0027s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork\u0027s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.WeWork\u0027s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann\u0027s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank\u0027s tender offer, some of the people said.The committee declined to comment for this article.SoftBank\u0027s offer to buy up to $3bn of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn\u0027t prepared to pay more.Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.Goldman Sachs profit hit by losses on investments in WeWork and UberWeWork\u0027s nosee is proof Adam Neumann can\u0027t walk on waterAs WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honour its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.But SoftBank told WeWork\u0027s board that it would not pay the $1.5bn if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.The problem from SoftBank\u0027s perspective was that those warrants were based on January\u0027s $47bn valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork\u0027s dramatic fall in value.JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork\u0027s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn\u0027t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee\u0027s deliberations in favor of SoftBank\u0027s offer, they added.SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 30 per cent, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork\u0027s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.WeWork has burned through almost $2.5bn\u0026nbspof cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilise the business.As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann\u0027s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann\u0027s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage.

At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHKardashian was eliminated in the third week of the show’s seventh season. Her brother, Rob Kardashian, appeared on the show three years later.Ahead of the release of Jesus Is King, West was interviewed by Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s Beats 1,\u0026nbspand proclaimed that he is “unquestionably, undoubtedly, the greatest human artist of all time.He added: “It’s not even a question at this point.

By drilling those holes, the rover is able to analyse the material inside,\u0026nbspturning them into powder and dropping them into a portable lab it carries around inside its belly.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe picture also shows just how far the Curiosity rover has come.

The new experiment saw it use the nine of the cups that are intended for wet chemistry experiments, however, which can be used to look for the carbon-based molecules that form the building blocks of life.That data can then be sent back down to Earth to allow scientists to pick through them and learn about the ancient history of Mars – and whatever life might have called it home.Since there are so few of those cups, researchers only use them when they are sure the possible findings will be important enough. That meant that the rover undertook only the second ever of experiments last month, despite having been on the planet since 2012.We\u0027ve been eager to find an area that would be compelling enough to do wet chemistry, said SAM Principal Investigator Paul\u0026nbspMahaffy\u0026nbspof NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight\u0026nbspCenter\u0026nbspin Greenbelt, Maryland.

Knowing his head was to be replaced with CGI, he covered his face in corpse paint and shrouded himself in a costume covered with Egyptian symbols and magical amulets, terrifying his co-stars in the process. Decades earlier, Cage had pulled out 12 of his own teeth in preparation for the lead role in Birdy (1984).Hilary Swank\u0027s exercise regime for drama Million Dollar Baby was so intense that it almost killed her. She spent so long in the gym (six days a week for three months) that a doctor told her a staph infection – caused by a burst blister on her foot – was hours away from reaching her heart.Such was the extent of Heath Ledger\u0027s commitment to the role of Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) that he ended up sleeping just two hours a night after locking himself away in a hotel room for an entire month to make a diary comprised of his villainous character\u0027s ramblings.Having lived an entire year in the life of late Doors frontman Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer had to go to therapy after struggling to get his life back on track. The actor had become so obsessed with the role that he ended up learning fifty of Morrison\u0027s songs and had everyone call him Jim on set of the 1991 biopic.Johnny Depp risked his life while preparing for the role of Hunter Thompson in Terry Gilliam\u0027s 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas he took hard drugs and spent his nights sleeping next to extremely dangerous containers of gunpowder and nitroglycerin.For war thriller Fury (2014), Shia LaBeouf slashed his own cheek and pulled a tooth out during filming. He also didn\u0027t wash for an entire month forcing the crew to arrange a separate room for him during night-time shoots.Rooney Mara completely changed her image to play the role of Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher\u0027s 2011 adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. She cut her hair, bleached her eyebrows and pierced her nipples to get into the mindset of the cyber hacker at the heart of Stieg Larrson\u0027s novels.Natalie Portman certainly worked for the Best Actress Oscar she received for 2010 film Black Swan. She shunned any suggestion of a body double for the film\u0027s extremely challenging dance scenes.In 2008, Joaquin Phoenix displayed some bizarre behaviour after\u0026nbsphe quit acting to become a hip-hop artist. It was later revealed that his life upheaval –\u0026nbspstrange interviews included – was, in fact, a giant hoax for mockumentary I\u0027m Still hereAfter hearing that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had a diet comprised of just fruit, Ashton Kutcher thought he\u0027d do the same in preparation for his role in biopic Jobs (2013). He ended up hospitalised for severe vitamin deficiencies as well as a reduction in bone density.After begging Spike Lee to let her play the role of crack addict Vivian in his 1991 film Jungle Fever, Halle Berry proved her dedication to the role by refusing to bathe for two whole weeks.Meryl Streep has recounted the time Dustin Hoffman slapped her on their first take filming 1979 orce drama Kramer vs Kramer, something everyone can agree was an unacceptable step too far.Known to be one of the biggest method actors around, Daniel Day-Lewis spent six months alone in the wilderness in preparation for his role in The Last of the Mohicans (1992).Anne Hathaway may have won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Les Misérables (2012), but the role of Fantine – which saw her cut off her hair and eat nothing but lettuce and oatmeal paste – left her in a state of deprivation, both physically and emotionally.Christian Bale has since vowed not to mess with his weight again following his Oscar win for Vice earlier this year but, back in 2004, he lost such an alarming amount of weight for the role of Trevor Reznik in The Machinist that he became virtually unrecognisable. I was intrigued by a perverse nature of mine just to see if I can go beyond what I\u0027ve been told is actually safe and okay, and see if I could push the limits, he went on to tell the BBC.While many would expect to see Charlize Theron here for her Oscar-winning turn as Aileen Wuornos in Monster, it\u0027s her role in spy film Atomic Blonde (2017) that saw her take things too far. Theron was so adamant she perform her own stunts that she bruised her ribs and clenched her teeth so hard she broke two of them. The entire cast of 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest stayed in a real mental asylum to prepare for the film. DeVito went so far as to dream up an imaginary friend, one he became convinced was real.To get into the lead role of Oscar-winning film The Pianist (2002), Adrien Brody upheaved his life so much that it took him over a year and a half to get things back on track not only did he starve himself to a staggering degree, but sold his home and broke up with his long-term girlfriend.   The Oscar-winner got so into his role of Joker in 2016\u0027s Suicide Squad that he sent his co-stars, including Margot Robbie and Will Smith, stray bullets and used condoms in the post. He event circulated a video of himself with nothing but a dead pig for company to the entire crew.Kate Winslet took her role of the former Nazi concentration camp guard at the heart of drama The Reader (2008) so seriously that she spoke with a German accent while at home with her family. She compared leaving the character behind her to escaping a serious car crash.For Taxi Driver, most actors wouldn\u0027t have  got themselves a fake license and cruised around New York City throughout the night to get into the role of the deranged Travis Bickle, but that\u0027s precisely what Robert De Niro ended up doing in 1976.Nicolas Cage has a history of taking his roles too far, but the peak arrived with the Ghost Rider sequel, Spirit of Vengeance (2011).

I was intrigued by a perverse nature of mine just to see if I can go beyond what I\u0027ve been told is actually safe and okay, and see if I could push the limits, he went on to tell the BBC.While many would expect to see Charlize Theron here for her Oscar-winning turn as Aileen Wuornos in Monster, it\u0027s her role in spy film Atomic Blonde (2017) that saw her take things too far. Theron was so adamant she perform her own stunts that she bruised her ribs and clenched her teeth so hard she broke two of them. The entire cast of 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest stayed in a real mental asylum to prepare for the film. DeVito went so far as to dream up an imaginary friend, one he became convinced was real.To get into the lead role of Oscar-winning film The Pianist (2002), Adrien Brody upheaved his life so much that it took him over a year and a half to get things back on track not only did he starve himself to a staggering degree, but sold his home and broke up with his long-term girlfriend.   The Oscar-winner got so into his role of Joker in 2016\u0027s Suicide Squad that he sent his co-stars, including Margot Robbie and Will Smith, stray bullets and used condoms in the post. He event circulated a video of himself with nothing but a dead pig for company to the entire crew.Kate Winslet took her role of the former Nazi concentration camp guard at the heart of drama The Reader (2008) so seriously that she spoke with a German accent while at home with her family. She compared leaving the character behind her to escaping a serious car crash.For Taxi Driver, most actors wouldn\u0027t have  got themselves a fake license and cruised around New York City throughout the night to get into the role of the deranged Travis Bickle, but that\u0027s precisely what Robert De Niro ended up doing in 1976.Beattie continued: “There’s that saying, ‘Don’t frown because it’s over, smile because it happened.’ The fact that they’re rebooting something that you did means that you did something that was worth rebooting. It’s an honour.Depp has played the role in five films across 14 years, which have accumulated box office takings of over $4.5 billion making it the 12th biggest franchise of all time.Disney is hoping that\u0026nbspJerry Bruckheimer\u0026nbspwill return to produce the new film.The most recent Pirates film, Dead Men Tell No Tales, was released in 2015 with director Joachim Rønning stating it was “only the beginning of the final adventureJoker becomes most successful R-rated film in box office historyDisney wants to ‘reboot’ Pirates of the CaribbeanPirates of the Caribbean movies had a $2 million snack budgetDepp’s most recent\u0026nbspappearance, in Fantastic Beasts sequel\u0026nbspThe Crimes of Grindelwald, was criticised after the actor was accused of domestic violence by his ex-wife Amber Heard in May 2016. He denied the allegations and settled the case months later.\u0026nbspJK Rowling and David Yates jumped to the actor’s defence with Depp himself stating: “JK has seen the evidence and therefore knows I was falsely accused, and that’s why she has publicly supported me. She would not stand up if she didn’t know the truth.”The first Pirates film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, was released in 2003 and co-starred Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush.The series is based on the theme park attraction of the same name, with Disney hoping to achieve similar success with new park ride adaptation Jungle Cruise,\u0026nbspstarring Dwayne Johnson and Jack Whitehall.

It coincided with the publication of Lord Bew\u0027s review and an announcement of extra funding for Scottish farmersQuickQuid customers who believe they may be owed compensation can contact the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) to make a complaint.However, the Ombudsman said:\u0026nbspWe will be working with the administrators of the company to understand what that means for consumers, but it is unlikely that we will be able to progress any existing complaints about CashEuroNet any further, or look at any new complaints about it.Once we have clarity on this from the administrators of the firm, we will be writing to people who currently have cases against CashEuroNet with us to advise them on what they should do.CashEuroNet is the UK’s most complained-about payday lender with 10,409 disputes lodged with the FOS last year.Almost two-thirds of those were upheld, leaving the firm with a hefty bill to redress customers. The company received a further 3,000 complaints in the first half of this year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Responsible lending is much needed in these difficult times for the UK economy.”David Fisher, chief executive of Cash Euro Net’s parent company Enova International, blamed the FOS for QuickQuid’s collapse.“Over the past year and a half, we have experienced a challenging and uncertain regulatory environment in the UK, despite the fact that the FCA reviewed and approved our business practices and affordability criteria in 2015,” he said.“The FOS has continued to move the goalposts with its complaints handling decisions, in effect setting ever-changing de facto policies that in many instances was inconsistent with FCA guidelines.”People who have outstanding loans with QuickQuid are advised to continue making repayments as normal.“If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating,” said Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service.“Eleven and a half million adults have less than £100 in savings and investments so lots of people face cash-flow problems which can make quick, short-term credit feel like the only option.\u0026nbsp“If you know you need a specific amount of money for a short while there may be more affordable alternatives out there, so it’s a good idea to shop around before you borrow.”The Money Advice Service website has a guide on alternatives to payday loans, and you can also contact a free helpline on 0800 138 7777Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Nun.\u0026nbspThese are just a few of the\u0026nbsphorror films\u0026nbspwhose production was allegedly plagued with strange occurrences.These accounts from cast, directors and crew members – which include incidents that occurred after the film\u0027s release – may have no truth to them, but\u0026nbspsomething odd is afoot with a lot of the cases.From mysterious on-set fires to tragic deaths\u0026nbspand terrifying cases of suspected paranormal activity, we\u0027ve compiled 17 examples of films that were supposedly hit by curses.Scroll through the below gallery to see them for yourself.Created with Sketch.17 scary films that were supposedly cursed Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rosemary\u0027s Baby producer William Castle was convinced Roman Polanski\u0027s 1968 chiller was cursed. After its release, he was hospitalised with kidney stones and, after experiencing hallucinations during his near-death experience, claimed to have seen the film\u0027s lead character approaching him with a knife. The Exorcist star Ellen Burstyn detailed a terrifying incident in which a fire burned the majority of the 1973 horror film\u0027s set to the ground. Despite it destroying the interiors depicting the MacNeil family\u0027s home, it somehow left the bedroom of the possessed Regan (Linda Blair) inexplicably untouched.The Omen was plagued by a lot of terrible incidents:  James Brolin claimed it was a ghostly presence that pushed him into appearing in The Amityville Horror he was thinking about the role when an item of clothing fell off a hanger in his bedroom, startling him. Ryan Reynolds, the lead star of the 2005 remake, would later claim to have woken up at 3.15am – otherwise known as the witching hour – every morning without rhyme or reason.Child star Oliver Robbins claimed he nearly died after being choked by the arms of the evil puppet featured in 1982 film Poltergeist. A few years after the film was released, young actor Heather O\u0027Rourke died from cardiac arrest and septic shock caused by a misdiagnosed intestinal stenosis. She was 12.Tragedy hit the Twilight Zone movie when director John Landis – who fell out with co-director Steven Spielberg due to unsafely cutting too many corners during production –\u0026nbsppushed ahead with a stunt despite windy conditions. When a helicopter flew out of control, it came crashing down right onto the precise position where actor Vic Morrow and two child stars, Myca Dinh Le, seven, and Renee Shin-Yi Chen, six, were killed by the whirring blades and falling debris. The incident, which saw Landis acquitted of manslaughter charges, led to greater regulations in on-set safety.You always felt like someone was going to die on this set, actor Laura Harrington said about Stephen King\u0027s Maximum Overdrive. The cursed film saw near-death experiences for cameramen and stuntmen as well as a hurricane, which hit the set during production. Camera assistant Silvia Giulietti would later say: Every day, we had security because the movie was a very dangerous movie.  Okay, Ghost may not be scary, but one of the biggest Hollywood urban legends goes that Poltergeist child star Heather O\u0027Rourke haunted the 1990 film\u0027s set. Crew members claimed to have continually heard the footsteps of an unseen figure as well as a child laughing. The film was shot on the same sound stage where O\u0027Rourke had filmed scenes as a child actor.917 The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005)The Exorcism of Emily Rose\u0027s lead star Jennifer Carpenter says she was haunted by a ghost that seemed to have a taste for the musical. She told Dread Central that, while she was working on the 2005 film, a radio would continually turn on by itself whenever she got home.The watery death of Samara in The Ring made a freak incident that happened during production on the film\u0027s sequel even stranger: the entire set flooded. Lead star Naomi Watts also claims that she felt odd vibrations on set that she couldn\u0027t explain.It was Insidious\u0027s hospital set where strange occurrences seemed to go down. While numerous members of the film\u0027s cast and crew complained about feeling unwell whenever they stepped foot onto set, there were also claims that a buzzer from an unoccupied floor of the building would continually go off. What was causing it remains unknown.A lot of the cast and crew associated with The Innkeepers experienced paranormal activity in the form of lights switching on and off for no reason. Doors would swing open and shut, frightening those who were present. Cast members even received phone calls that, when they answered, would have nobody on the other end. The hotel where the film was shot, the Yankee Peddler Inn in Connecticut, is known to be a hotspot for ghost hunters.Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who starred in 2012 horror film The Possession, didn\u0027t believe in ghosts before filming began, but walked away convinced they are real. According to the film\u0027s stars, odd occurrences plagued the set, which included the explosion of light bulbs and cold breezes following them around. The possessed box at the heart of the film was later destroyed in a storage facility fire.Vera Farmiga, who played real-life paranormal investigator Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring, was so uneasy about making the film that she left the script outside her house. Despite this, one morning she woke up to find three slashes on her laptop screen. 1517 Return to Babylon (2013)Silent film Return to Babylon is said to have captured demonic activity on film. Director Alex Monty Canawati used an old-school camera with black-and-white film that he mysteriously found in a bag, but when he watched back what he\u0027d caught on camera, the lead actors\u0027s faces had morphed into demonic-looking creatures.Annabelle\u0027s director, John R Leonetti, claimed to have seen three fingers drawn through dust on set multiple times– terrifying, because the demonic doll at the heart of the film has three fingers. Annabelle isn\u0027t the only Conjuring spin-off that seems to have been haunted. Corin Hardy, who directed The Nun, says he saw two men in a room he was filming in at a castle in Romania. After completing the take, he turned to the men – assuming them to be members of the crew –\u0026nbspbut they were gone. Chillingly, they would have had to pass him to leave the room.Rosemary\u0027s Baby producer William Castle was convinced Roman Polanski\u0027s 1968 chiller was cursed. After its release, he was hospitalised with kidney stones and, after experiencing hallucinations during his near-death experience, claimed to have seen the film\u0027s lead character approaching him with a knife. The Exorcist star Ellen Burstyn detailed a terrifying incident in which a fire burned the majority of the 1973 horror film\u0027s set to the ground. Despite it destroying the interiors depicting the MacNeil family\u0027s home, it somehow left the bedroom of the possessed Regan (Linda Blair) inexplicably untouched.The Omen was plagued by a lot of terrible incidents:  James Brolin claimed it was a ghostly presence that pushed him into appearing in The Amityville Horror he was thinking about the role when an item of clothing fell off a hanger in his bedroom, startling him. Ryan Reynolds, the lead star of the 2005 remake, would later claim to have woken up at 3.15am – otherwise known as the witching hour – every morning without rhyme or reason.Child star Oliver Robbins claimed he nearly died after being choked by the arms of the evil puppet featured in 1982 film Poltergeist. A few years after the film was released, young actor Heather O\u0027Rourke died from cardiac arrest and septic shock caused by a misdiagnosed intestinal stenosis. She was 12.Tragedy hit the Twilight Zone movie when director John Landis – who fell out with co-director Steven Spielberg due to unsafely cutting too many corners during production –\u0026nbsppushed ahead with a stunt despite windy conditions. When a helicopter flew out of control, it came crashing down right onto the precise position where actor Vic Morrow and two child stars, Myca Dinh Le, seven, and Renee Shin-Yi Chen, six, were killed by the whirring blades and falling debris. The incident, which saw Landis acquitted of manslaughter charges, led to greater regulations in on-set safety.You always felt like someone was going to die on this set, actor Laura Harrington said about Stephen King\u0027s Maximum Overdrive. The cursed film saw near-death experiences for cameramen and stuntmen as well as a hurricane, which hit the set during production. Camera assistant Silvia Giulietti would later say: Every day, we had security because the movie was a very dangerous movie.  Okay, Ghost may not be scary, but one of the biggest Hollywood urban legends goes that Poltergeist child star Heather O\u0027Rourke haunted the 1990 film\u0027s set. Crew members claimed to have continually heard the footsteps of an unseen figure as well as a child laughing. The film was shot on the same sound stage where O\u0027Rourke had filmed scenes as a child actor.917 The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005)The Exorcism of Emily Rose\u0027s lead star Jennifer Carpenter says she was haunted by a ghost that seemed to have a taste for the musical. She told Dread Central that, while she was working on the 2005 film, a radio would continually turn on by itself whenever she got home.The watery death of Samara in The Ring made a freak incident that happened during production on the film\u0027s sequel even stranger: the entire set flooded. Lead star Naomi Watts also claims that she felt odd vibrations on set that she couldn\u0027t explain.It was Insidious\u0027s hospital set where strange occurrences seemed to go down. While numerous members of the film\u0027s cast and crew complained about feeling unwell whenever they stepped foot onto set, there were also claims that a buzzer from an unoccupied floor of the building would continually go off. What was causing it remains unknown.A lot of the cast and crew associated with The Innkeepers experienced paranormal activity in the form of lights switching on and off for no reason. Doors would swing open and shut, frightening those who were present. Cast members even received phone calls that, when they answered, would have nobody on the other end. The hotel where the film was shot, the Yankee Peddler Inn in Connecticut, is known to be a hotspot for ghost hunters.Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who starred in 2012 horror film The Possession, didn\u0027t believe in ghosts before filming began, but walked away convinced they are real. According to the film\u0027s stars, odd occurrences plagued the set, which included the explosion of light bulbs and cold breezes following them around.

Digital photogrammetry being used to record 3D images of the micro-topography on the tops of the lintels at Stonehenge. “Our investigation will tell us much about Bronze Age metalworking technology, how the bronze artefacts were used – and their potential role in the belief systems of that time,” says archaeologist\u0026nbspAndy Peachey, a prehistorian from Archaeological Solutions, the specialist unit which carried out the excavation.It’s the largest ever Bronze Age hoard to be discovered in London, and one of the three largest ever found in the UK.Mystery of ‘extraordinary’ haul of Bronze Age weapons baffles expertsBronze Age saw flourishing drug trade, opium in ancient vase revealsArchaeologists discover long-lost tools used to build StonehengeThe site, near Rainham in the London Borough of Havering, directly overlooks what would have been a large area of of frequently flooded Thames-side marshland.The find is particularly significant because of the known ancient tradition of worshipping rivers as sacred. That tradition was strong throughout much of Britain and continental Europe, and parts of western and southern Asia.On the whole, with relatively few exceptions, river deities tended to be female.There are literally thousands of rivers in Europe and Asia associated with known and named ancient deities – including Sequana (the Seine), Sionann (the Shannon), Verbeia (the Wharf), Durius (the Douro in Portugal), Alpheus (River Alfeios in Greece), Tiberinus (the Tiber in Italy), and Ganga (the Ganges in India).Sequana – the goddess of the River SeineIn dozens of cases the mythological narrative, revealing a river’s ine status, has survived across the millennia.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In aggregate, the artefacts weighed 45 kilos and represented around 300 originally complete objects.The excavation also revealed three other pits – containing hundreds of fragments of broken pottery (potentially general refuse – or even the debris from small-scale ceremonial feasting).Significantly, two other hoards of metalwork are known from the area, discovered just a few miles away back in the 1950s and the 1960s.The precise location and nature of the site itself (at the end of a promontory and immediately adjacent to and facing directly onto one of the Thames Valley’s largest wetlands) suggests a potential ritual or ceremonial function, rather than a purely commercial one.Intriguingly, the circular building’s entranceway faces north, which is not the norm for ordinary residential roundhouses.19th-century Indian artist Raja Ravi Varma portrays the goddess Ganga descending from heaven to form the River Ganges on EarthHowever, in most other cases of marshland-related metalwork deposits, the prehistoric rituals involved placing bronze artefacts in (or throwing them into) rivers and swamps, rather than merely burying them immediately adjacent to a wetland.Although a prehistoric commercial function cannot be completely ruled out, it is conceivable that the artefacts may have been held in storage within the complex, awaiting eventual ritual deposition in the adjacent swamp. Indeed, it is possible that burying it within a sacred enclosure would have been seen as giving the items sacred status, if the intention was to later deposit them in the adjacent marsh.However, the bronzes were all deposited in the pits at virtually the same time – but at the very end of the lifetime of the complex. It is therefore also possible that they were interred as an act of ritual closure – marking the sanctified decommissioning of this probably sacred site overlooking the Thames-side marshes.If indeed the complex was a ritual or ceremonial centre involved in the veneration of water spirits – or of a river deity –\u0026nbspit will raise the question as to the potential identity of a prehistoric Thames god or goddess.Although there are at least half a dozen Roman and Romano Celtic temples (all dating from at least 900 years after the Rainham complex), none of them give any clue as to what the name of such an ancient Thames deity might have been.Since at least the 18th century, Old Father Thames has been a popular literary and artistic motif – but he is probably a romantic early modern invention.18th century sculpture of Old Father Thames – but the river’s real ancient deity was probably a goddess (Juan Gutiérrez Andrés (CC BY-SA 3.0))Any truly ancient Thames deity would almost certainly have been female (like other British, Irish and French examples).Certainly, votive offerings have been deposited in the Thames for the past 5,500 years. The oldest known name for London’s river is the Tamessa (Tamesis in Latin).Bronze Age Britons lived with 1m-long worms in their kidneysHowever, that name was almost certainly originally pre-Celtic – and potentially even pre-Indo-European. It seems to be linked with an Old European word meaning ‘to flow’.So it can potentially just be translated as “the flowing one”\u0026nbsp– ie\u0026nbspsimply “The River”. Sadly, its more specific original name (if it ever had one) is lost, submerged at some point far back in the stream of time.Commenting on the discovery of the Rainham Bronze Age metalwork, Roy Stephenson, historic environment lead\u0026nbspat the Museum of London, said: “It’s incredibly rare to have uncovered a hoard of this size on one site”.Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: “This extraordinary discovery adds immensely to our understanding of Bronze Age life.”The bronzes will go on display for the first time as the focal point of a major exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands in April 2020.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as chief executive but was still WeWork\u0027s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on 6 October, the sources said.The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management chief executive Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.With questions swirling around WeWork\u0027s chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.Created with Sketch.Tech giants to be hit by new tax in France Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018A few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork\u0027s largest shareholder, Japan\u0027s SoftBank.Both were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.This account of how WeWork\u0027s financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.SoftBank offered $9.5bn\u0026nbspto WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company\u0027s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann\u0027s controlling grip.SoftBank\u0027s deal would strip Neumann\u0027s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China\u0027s Hony Capital, for the company\u0027s precipitous decline, some of the people said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork\u0027s lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.The problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as chief executive\u0026nbspon 24 September because, as WeWork\u0027s founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.WeWork staff outraged at former CEO’s payout while they face job cutsIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann\u0027s personal borrowings made against WeWork\u0027s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970m of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.SoftBank\u0027s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9bn based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.Neumann\u0027s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork\u0027s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.WeWork\u0027s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann\u0027s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank\u0027s tender offer, some of the people said.The committee declined to comment for this article.SoftBank\u0027s offer to buy up to $3bn of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn\u0027t prepared to pay more.Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.Goldman Sachs profit hit by losses on investments in WeWork and UberWeWork\u0027s nosee is proof Adam Neumann can\u0027t walk on waterAs WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honour its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.But SoftBank told WeWork\u0027s board that it would not pay the $1.5bn if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.The problem from SoftBank\u0027s perspective was that those warrants were based on January\u0027s $47bn valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork\u0027s dramatic fall in value.JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork\u0027s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn\u0027t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee\u0027s deliberations in favor of SoftBank\u0027s offer, they added.SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 30 per cent, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork\u0027s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.WeWork has burned through almost $2.5bn\u0026nbspof cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilise the business.As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann\u0027s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann\u0027s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite occupying such an important place in science fiction, as well as being the subject of feverish research by scientists, they are yet to be confirmed.But if they do exist, astronomers have proposed a way that we might be able to see them.Researchers hope that they might be able to spot a wormhole around the supermassive black hole at the middle of our Milky Way galaxy, which is known as Sagittarius A*. There is no specific reason to think the black hole has one – but researchers think that the extreme and turbulent gravitational conditions of a supermassive black hole should be a good place to find one.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberIf there is one lurking at the heart of our galaxy, the stars in our galaxy should be influenced by the gravity of stars at the other end of the wormhole, the researchers suggest. That should make it possible to see one, if indirectly, by looking for the slight deviations in the orbits of the nearby stars.Supermassive black hole exploded in Milky Way, scientists findIf you have two stars, one on each side of the wormhole, the star on our side should feel the gravitational influence of the star that\u0027s on the other side. The gravitational flux will go through the wormhole, said\u0026nbspDejan Stojkovic, cosmologist and professor of physics in the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences. So if you map the expected orbit of a star around Sagittarius A*, you should see deviations from that orbit if there is a wormhole there with a star on the other side.Sadly, even if there is a wormhole relatively nearby it will not be possible to travel through it and find yourself elsewhere in the universe, scientists say.Even if a wormhole is traversable, people and spaceships most likely aren\u0027t going to be passing through, said Dr Stojkovic.

Under Theresa May’s we could have been trapped in it forever, unable to do global trade deals.To put it back into the agreement kills it. Not least because the deal agreed with Brussels is merely the mechanism by which we leave — it is not meant to determine our future relationship.One Labour MP vows to support Boris’s Bill, then back this amendment destroying it. If the public considers MPs ocean-going idiots, this is why.But the EU should help get the deal over the line by rejecting the extension Remainers forced the PM to request.MPs would have to pass it or revoke Brexit. They lack the guts for the latter.HARRY and Meghan are not victims. Not of tabloid “bullying”. Not of racism.Their claim that they are “existing, not living” is a tin-eared insult to millions who find joy despite daily struggles dwarfing those of this cosseted pair.The Sun could not have been happier for them when they married. We called their magical wedding “a wonderful symbol of the country we have become. Open, warm-hearted, brilliantly erse”.We’re sorrythey didn’t understand that along with the adulation would come other stories in the public interest — and scrutinythey chose to lecture the public on how to live their lives.Instead of maturely accepting it, or ignoring it, they declared war on the Press and indulged in a giant whinge.No, Royals with publicly-funded mansions, fabulous holidays and staff are not disqualied from being unhappy. Harry and Meghan do seem to be ­vulnerable and need help. But they should count their many blessings too.And spare a thought for those who endure crippling rents, mortgages, bills and tough, low-paid jobs with far more fortitude and less self-pity.FUNNY how so many MPs trashing our democracy no longer have skin in the game.Take giggling birdbrain Oliver Letwin whose calamitous career, a bulging ­dossier of catastrophic failure, will end before the next election. Or Speaker Bercow — the grandiloquent, circumlocutory, periphrastic, tautological Remainer slug — who is off soon too.Meanwhile Labour is now openly betraying its  Leave voters while desperately trying to avoid an election.So many politicians — unaccountable and yet key to thwarting the .million majority.

Meghan is struggling with le as a new motherand the global attention that comes with joining the “The Firm”. And Harry wants to protect her.But their latest complaints seemed poorly timed and worryingly self-indulgent. How  can you describe the royal couple seeing impoverished young African girls learning to box so they can fight off sexual predators, then using air time to address their First World problems with the media The same media, I might add, that was praising Meghan’s obvious intelligence and charm and had hitherto featured glowing reports from their first official overseas tour together.Prince William is reportedly “worried” about his brother’s state of mind, and after watching the documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey, one could only agree and conclude that we’re seeing a man teetering on the edge.The rampant paranoia, the relentless victim narrative and a tendency towards the dramatic are all perhaps signs that Harry does indeed need to take a break from public le before he unravels even further.But during that respite, he must surely seek specialist help and ask himself this: Is his obvious angst really just down to the media occasionally writing inconvenient truths about his we’s fractured family and questioning the couple’s obvious hypocrisy at using private jets while preaching about climate change OR is it the result of unresolved issues surrounding his mother Diana’s untimely death  My money’s on the latter, not least because Harry’s escalating rhetoric around the “safety of my family” rang alarm bells with me.As a child, my husband witnessed the accidental death of his -month- old brother and was put in the ambulance with his screaming mother. When he was , his -year- old father died suddenly at home during an afternoon nap.Both were deeply traumatic events that, by the time we met in , he thought he’d dealt with. But, in late , the birth of our daughter triggered a delayed response and he became riven with anxiety that something might happen to her.He developed the now resolved habit of what psychiatrist’s might refer to as “catastrophising” where, in his mind, a cut finger would escalate to potential sepsis and, like  Harry, “the safety of my ­family”  was an oft repeated mantra to try to  quash rational debate.Put simply, he felt a loss of ­control over what happened to his brother and father, which then manested itself in a disproportionately dramatic reaction to even the simplest of le’s problems and an inability to see past them.So I can only wonder whether the birth of his son Archie has triggered the same powerful reaction in Harry, who admits he thought he was out of the woods with his mental health, “but suddenly it all came back.” It would certainly explain his tears at the recent WellChild Awards, where his speech centred on his and Meghan’s feelings since having achild rather than focusing on the stories of those being celebrated.And it was “the safety of my family” he used to explain the use of private jets when, just a few days later, William and Kate — the future King and Queen of Britain — quietly boarded a commercial flight to Scotland with their kids and the dference in attitudes was there for all to see.Both William and Harry suffered the untimely loss of their mother and — wrongly, to my mind — faced the intolerable pressure of having to walk behind her coffin while the world looked on.BUT as William has clearly learned toaround the trauma and get on with his le in a mature and rational way, Harry still seems troubled, angry and prone to irrational outbursts.“I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,” he declared to interviewer and friend Tom Bradby.The tragic sequence of events that led to the death of his mother were going to the Paris Ritz with an international playboy, deciding to leave the safety of their hotel suite at midnight when they knew there were motorbike paps outside, unwittingly getting into a car driven by someone well over the drink-drive limit and not wearing a seatbelt.So yes, the paparazzi followed the carand, in an ideal world, they wouldn’t have.But a French inquiry cleared the bikes of involvement in the crash and, in the real world, anyone famous knows thatyou don’t want to be “papped” you live your le accordingly by maintaining a low profile and avoiding celebrity hang-outs.The Cambridges know that ­living a quiet, unremarkable le is the greatest antidote to unwanted media attention but also accept that the trade-off for the privilege le of being royal is that, ­occasionally, there will be “off message” stories and opinions they don’t like.On the South Africa tour, tetchy Prince Harry behaved like an entitled elite when he chastised Sky’s invited royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills for asking him a perfectly anodyne question about his visit.Later, while reporting from William and Kate’s hugely successful tour of Pakistan, Rhiannon praised the Cambridges for their regular and friendly interactions with the media.She observes that they clearly understand that official duty for Queen and country come first.“Compare it with the tone of the end of Prince Harry and Meghan’s tour a few weeks ago and you couldn’t have a bigger contrast,” she adds. “Harry had made it all about them by releasing a statement announcing legal action against The Mail on Sunday and criticising the Press.”EQUALLY, it’s worth noting that, like Meghan, Kate also had to adapt to royal le and, despite being mum to three young children, has never publicly complained about her lot.Probably because she understands that there are millions of people in the country with far worse problems and without the support network or finances to cushion the blow.That’s a rational outlook but, right now, Harry is clearly locked in a victim narrative where the nasty Press hunted his mother to her death and even the mildest criticism of him or his we is taken as “bullying” behaviour that threatens their very existence.I feel sympathy for him, but only he can change that self-pitying narrative, with his we’s support. Unfortunately, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have a close-knit family around her and, judging by what she said in the same ­documentary, may be enabling rather than ­calming his paranoia.She said her British friends had warned her off marrying Harry because “the British tabloids will destroy your le.” Really  Or did they rightly just advise that the Press attention would be several notches higher than she’d been used to  Particularly as she has a rather off- message family Certainly not the poor man at Wimbledon who got ticked off by “Meghan’s ­people” for trying to take a photo of her when he was actually taking a selfie.No, it’s definitely time for a ­period of rest and, ­hopefully, reflection.  And , at the end of it, they decide to step away from royal le and live as private citizens, then we wish them nothing but the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris believes in better times.Like Buzz Lightyear he punches the air and cries: “To infinity and beyond!”What do you think when you see Big Ben or a photograph of the twirly-towered Houses of Parliament standing next to the gracious River Thames Most of us, I guess, used to feel a little bounce of patriotism when we heard Big Ben’s bongs.But the bonging has long since ceased to have that effect — indeed, the bongs don’t even sound any more, owing to the repairs being done to the clock tower.The sheer sight of Parliament now, I suspect, fills many voters with feelings of irritation and boredom, and maybe worse.As Bonfire Night approaches, it may never have been easier to sympathise with Guy Fawkes and his gunpowder plotters.This is, please, not an incitement to you all to burrow into the cellars under the Palace of Westminster with barrels of explosives and fizzing fuses.But would it not be tempting to tie a stick or two of dynamite to the tail of Commons Speaker John Bercow Is there not at least a small part of you that would welcome a big, cartoon-style ka-boom in the Commons lavatories and seeing the likes of Hilary Benn and Dominic Grieve QC and Yvette Cooper and Sir Oliver Ruddy Letwin emerging with their faces sooted, their hairdos standing up on end and their trousers round their knocking knees Back in the days of the Soviet Union there was a man called Andrei Gromyko, who was almost a self-parody of grumpiness.Gromyko was foreign minister for the Soviets from - and he undoubtedly had a brilliant mind.Yet there he would stand on the Kremlin’s viewing balcony at the May Day parades, wrapped tight into his smart coat and hat, and his grim, unyielding face said it all.Gromyko wanted no change. He wanted the status quo to last forever.He became known as Mr Nyet. That’s Nyet for No, never forever. Well, the brutal Soviet empire didn’t last for ever, as we now know.Gromyko stood on the wrong side of history. Soviet Marxism was shattered and the Berlin Wall fell.Parliamentary opponents of Brexit will one day be seen to have been similarly obstructive.Like Gromyko, the only answer they have is the negative.It is not because they are stupid. Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer, and that giggling nitwit Letwin, are well-read gents.Hilary Benn is probably brighter than his old man Tony was.Grieve and Anna Soubry are both lawyers, though you might not want them defending you in a big trial in case they got up the jury’s noses with their stone-faced insistence that no one  can possibly ever be right.And then there’s Bercow. The soon-to-depart speaker is a chippy, itchy, batey little piglet and one of the most gloriously public cuckolds of the kingdom but he has a perfectly good brain on him.It’s not lack of cleverness that afflicts them. It is their inability to realise that the public wants hope.Voters crave optimism in their politicians.They want leaders who offer solutions, not dismal shroud-wavers like Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.And after three years of this inertia, the desire for some brightness and happiness has never been keener.That is why Boris is flying in the opinion polls.It may not be that we all like every dotted I and crossed T of his Brexit deal.Plenty of us would have accepted No Deal. It is not that the voters have suddenly become Tories.But they warm to the Johnsonian can-do spirit.When everyone said he would never extract concessions from Brussels, he did.When everyone said he was a shallow joker, he found a statesmanlike tone which hailed European civilisation while embracing British independence.His opponents, lips curling, said he was just a racist, sexist nationalist who would sell out to Donald Trump.Boris crinkled his eyes, spoke up for the NHS and talked of healing and progress.Britain has had enough of the grumps and glumbuckets.Parliament needs to rediscover the miraculous qualities of the words “can” and “yes”.

That is totally understandable. But there is a risk to attempting it before delivering Brexit as he promised.There is a danger too, of course, that Remainers will kill his deal in the next fortnight via fatal amendments. Most Labour “moderates” in Leave seats cannot be trusted to back it, however much they hope to pull the wool over their constituents’ eyes.But the PM can then go to the polls promising that a Tory majority will reverse their tricks and finalise his deal.As it stands, Labour must agree to any election. And it is truly jaw-dropping to watch them running away, having screamed for so long for the chance to replace the dastardly Tories.With their ratings in freefall and in mortal fear of Boris’s popularity, they concoct ever more ludicrous excuses to dodge a reckoning. It is shredding the last remnants of their credibility.The public wants an election, by  per cent to . Labour cannot hide from it.They are stricken, ided and handicapped by the most unpopular political leader in UK history — but they will be seen too as snivelling cowards who put their party before their country.For the moment, though, Boris’s best bet is as his slogan says: to get Brexit done.IT is a scandal that the fracking revolution was strangled at birth.The Whitehall report saying it is “years behind schedule” doesn’t nearly cover the failure.Shale gas could power Britain cheaply for a generation, lower bills and create thousands of jobs. It would be far more eco-friendly than burning coal.But the Tories lost the PR war against a green social media campaign which terried the public using debunked and out-of-date US scare stories. Most people know little of fracking except that they are meant to despise and fear it.The Cameron Government could have pushed back hard. Instead it buckled and hit fracking firms with regulations making exploration all but impossible.What a calamitous missed opportunity.IT is impossible to imagine the terrying ordeal of the  migrants who died in a refrigerated truck.And we recoil at the evil and greed of the traffickers who have profited from this appalling tragedy.The only comfort is that there is every chance, from the details already known, that they will be brought to justice.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Johnson admitted the EU was inclined to offer an extension to the end of January and that Emmanuel Macron was fighting a lonely battle against it.Earlier in the day, the Elysée told No the French President was too isolated on the issue to veto a longer extension.In a sign of how much he is relying on Macron, Johnson then pleadingly recited the opening line of the carol “Oh come, oh come Emmanuel” to ministers.One of No’s hopes is that EU leaders will see the Opposition refusing both a general election and to pass the withdrawal agreement as is and come round to Macron’s way of thinking: That there is little point in offering this country a three-month extension as ­Parliament will just waste the time.One No source predicts that the sight of the opposition blocking an election will “push the EU towards either the Macron position or a very long extension”.In a sign that Johnson’s gambit is having some success, the EU is waiting until Parliament has voted on an election before deciding whatof extension to offer.If this doesn’t work, the Government hopes it can shame Labour into having an election.The Chief Whip told those present that they would “make Labour look like right d***s”they didn’t vote for an election.But not everyone is convinced this will work.One of those present tells me thatthey were a Labour MP, they would “rather look like a d*** than lose their seat”.I understand, though, No intends to bring multiple votes to try to force an election. One Cabinet minister who has discussed this strategy with Johnson tells me: “Every time , it advertises that they are not prepared to support Brexit or have an election.“It reinforces the sense that he is the only person trying to get things done.”Johnson himself has told allies thatLabour rejects his offer to pass the withdrawal agreement and have an election, then it will be an “effective demonstration” that this Parliament won’t — and can’t — break the current deadlock.Proving this Parliament can’t break the deadlock is one thing. Actually breaking it is quite another.One of those present on Thursday tells me Johnson seemed genuinely angry at Labour’s refusal to give him an election and “betrayed a sense he’s cornered”.Something must happen before January , though.If it doesn’t, the threat of No Deal will be back on the table.Andthe UK has wasted this extension, European patience may snap and they might not offer another one.One senior Cabinet minister tells me “there will be an attempt to use an SOto put the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before the House”. This would involve the rebel group around Oliver Letwin trying to bring the deal back to Parliament so that the Commons could vote on it. But it is far from clear whether this approach could work.Another possibility is the Opposition bringing down the Government. If they did this, they would have to agree on an alternative prime minister or end up in a general election.British politics looks more deadlocked than ever today. Johnson’s hope is that pressure from voters will eventually break this deadlock and sweep away the obstacles to him passing his Brexit deal.But he will almost certainly have to put up with a delay both to Brexit and the election before he can get his way.NO one at political Cabinet spoke against the idea of a December election. But privately, several ministers have grave doubts about the wisdom of this strategy.One frets: “Who jumps out of bed on a cold December morning to vote for the Government ”There is a view that the Government could have used getting the Commons to approve its deal in broad terms as a spur for pressing on with the ­legislation, bringing a new timetable to the Commons after MPs rejected its initial offer of three days’ debate. One complains that the election idea is “a massive distraction”.“Why aren’t we using the momentum of getting a second reading ” they ask.On the backbenches there are also concerns. One senior backbencher tells me: “We’ll vote for an election with great reluctance.”He worries that “being seen to try not very hard to get the bill through” undercuts the new Tory message that they are the deal party.The other great worry is that while the public mood is with Boris Johnson now, that could change. One minister warns it is a huge risk to have a “winter election at a very febrile time”, adding: “We’ve no idea what public opinion will be on polling day.”IF Boris Johnson gets his way and there’s a general election this year, what happens to those Tories who lost the whip for voting for the Benn Act At Thursday’s gathering, Nicky Morgan argued that the party needed “clarity” on what would happen to those who had lost the whip but had voted with the Government against the Letwin amendment and for the Brexit deal and the accelerated timetable for passing it.Boris Johnson has previously been adamant that he would not allow any of the  to stand as Tory candidates at the next election. But I am told he made sympathetic noises in response to Morgan’s point.Inside Boris Johnson’s circle, there’s the beginnings of a sht in attitude. There is a feeling that those who have consistently voted with the Government in recent weeks are worth bringing back in.With a deal secured, the issue that led to their rebellion has been addressed.At the same time, several of these MPs would be better placed to hold their seat for the Tories than any other candidate.AT political Cabinet on Thursday, Boris Johnson pointed at the Northern Powerhouse Minister Jake Berry and said “Kwasi”, a reference to Kwasi Kwarteng the Energy Minister.Cabinet ministers were baffled at how the PM confused the two.They don’t look at all alike.After Berry deadpanned, “An easy mistake to make”, the room fell about laughing.A Budget would offer the Tories a chance to outline some of their more popular economic policies and highlight plans to boost infrastructure.If the Opposition voted it down, it would make the case for the election Boris Johnson so desperately wants.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No one will believe the Labour party are going to allow Breixt to happen unless there is the deadline of an election on December .”Warning that the crippling stand off could last well into next year, a Downing Street source added: “We couldn’t hold an election in January as that would mean campaigning over Christmas, which wouldn’t be popular, so an election vote this week is the last chance.“If MPs don’t vote for an election this week, they are voting for not just one extension but another in January too.”Mr Corbyn set the conditions of Labour’s support for a December  election very high - designed to make it almost impossible for the PM to agree.In a fresh demand, the Labour leader called on the PM to tweak the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to make it legally impossible for Britain to drop out of the EU at the end of the transition period in December  without a deal.The PM’s current Brexit deal states that the transition period - during which Britain has to comply with all EU rules without having a say in them - can be extended by a maximum of two years.But that can only happenthe Government decides to extend.Mr Corbyn’s new demand would mean the UK would automatically enter an extended transition period for up to two years.Speaking on ITV’s This Morning Show, Mr Corbyn said: Providing the Prime Minister comes to Parliament on Monday and makes it absolutely clear he is going to make sure that there is no crash out - because his deal includes the possibility of a no-deal exit.Hes going to have to do that because thats how Parliament works: weve got to hold him to account. I think a no-deal exit is very dangerous. If he comes on Monday and says that, OK.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Former hairdresser Zoe Smith - who didnapost want to reveal her real name - began working at the sex line, television channel and website after ditching her gruelling -hour shts on a cruise ship . Zoe has insisted that her job is mainly people calling her up and asking her questions, including one caller who rings just to speak about her pet cat for an hour.Zoe, , has worked at Babestation for almost two years. In August she suffered an horric attack in a Birmingham bar, when she glassed in the face by a woman in a row over some seats, and since then she has mainly worked on the webcam shts rather than the TV channel.  She has previously featured on TV shows Take Me Out, Dinner Date and Tattoo Fixers.Zoe, from Worcester, told Birmingham Live : People have this really bad stereotype that itaposs really naughty sex chat all the time.She said some girls choose to wear their pyjamas on the website, but must entertain whatever desires the caller may have. You can wear what you want, cover upyou want, go and wear your pyjamas or nice lingerie or a nice dress. You have to look presentable and be willing to sell them to the fantasy, because the whole point is that people who have desires and canapost live them through day to day can call you up. Whether that be someone to talk to or someone to express how theyaposre feeling, theyaposre lonely or they like the way you look and their girlfriend doesnapost look like that.    Customers can pay to enter a chat and can make requests - which can include removing her shoes, playing with her hair or bending over - but she says they must build rapport with her first. You do what you want. Some of the guys say aposI want to see you doing thisapos, but itaposs important they build a relationship or a friendship with you first, she said. You have to be willing to talk about anything and at the same token,you are uncomfortable you can just log yourself off and go and take five minutes. Iaposm never ever uncomfortable there but theyaposre paying so you have to treat it like itaposs customer service. Zoe described the strangers who call her up as brave men, and said she finds the attention flattering. The way I see it,youaposre at home or youaposre doing something in your day and you want to speak to a complete stranger that you like the look of, I think thataposs a really brave thing to do, so I actually admire it. Itaposs really flattering that someone would speak to me so I like to delve into why theyaposve called. One guy honestly calls me for an hour to talk about my cat. He knows I love my cat and he likes to know how he is. They like to make friends out of you as well. Zoe said the night shts, which start form pm, are a lot more sexually motivated as girls are permitted to show a lot more. However, she opts for day hours only. The whole nature of it is that you tease, she said.  I thoughtIaposm online or on telly getting nude, where does that end  People have already seen it so for me I donapost show a lot. I donapost get nude or naked and I keep it that way, because I am quite a private person anyway. Zoe works two to three -pm shts a week to make a living, but although she is looking for love she says she earns so much men can be intimidated by her. Iaposm just in my aposs having fun, getting to know myself and making sure that I am the best version of myself, and I think Iaposm on the right track to [meet someone], so fingers crossed. Askedthe sexual nature of her works puts off potential dates, she said the problem was more the earnings. Itaposs been more questions about the income and aposwhat do you earn  How come you only work two, three times a week  Get a real jobapos - that kind of thing. Itaposs more been a threat because they donapost understand how a woman can earn more than them, and work less. They get a bit envious of it, a bit jealous and a bit unaware of what it entails so kind of try and attack it. I have had it, hence why Iaposm single and itaposs not worth the drama at the moment. When you meet the right person theyaposd understand anyway.Zoe wouldnapost say how much she gets paid, but revealed customers sometimes offer her cash on top of her wage or gts including perfume or outfits to wear - purchased from a wish list compiled by each of the girls online. They buy you things, perfume, shoes, outfits you might want to wear. Interaction is on twitter and the website Only Fans. They do call up and ask to buy you things. They offer to [give you money] but I donapost like to say yes, because I like to be aware of what Iaposm earning.

When she started pre-school she noticed and she asked aposwhy have I got a point chest and the other kids haven’t apos  “She has got speech delay as well and doesn’t like speaking in front of people because of that.Then to have her thinking she is even more dferent to the other kids because of her chest – it’s upsetting.

Stay as calm as you can and help them by carefully restraining them and then you want to open their mouth which is sometimes easier done with two people. And only do thisyou are confident you are not putting yourself at risk. You would open their mouth and check inside to seethere was anything obvious. Which you would just check to seethereaposs anything obvious. Donapost be tempted to put your fingers in and sweep around unless there is something very obvious that you can see. And it might be easier to use tweesers forceps to remove anything.    For a small dog, you would turn them fully upside down, and grab them by their thighs then gently shake them. For larger dogs itaposs important to get them into a position were gravity would help. Larger dogs need to be titled onto their front legs, with the head facing down, in a sort of wheel barrow position. Gravity will help to then dislodge the object, butyour dog is wretching or coughing and this hasnapost worked, then the next step is the Heimlich Manouvre.    If you look down their chest their is a natural gap after their ribs, and itaposs in that gap that you put your hands. You need to put the thumb part of your first up underneath the abdomen, and the other hand placed over that first, you need to pull upwards towards her chest. You would do that up to five times and hopefully that will dislodge the item. If that hasnapost worked get the animal to a vet, and evenit has get your dog checked out quickly. What to doyour dog is unconscious and not breathing  If your dog is unconscious and not breathing, you should proceed with caution. Emma explains: If you suspect a dog is unconscious, proceed with extreme caution, particularlyitaposs not your dog. An injured dog is far more likely to bite you and they may not be unconscious so be careful. Approach them from behind. You start by touching them with the back of the foot first, and speak to them aswell. So youaposre not kicking them your just touching them gently. You would then touch them with the back of your hand. Itaposs far less invasive than the front of your hand. Keep looking for any kind of response at all, andthereaposs no response then you need to open their airway.  Only approach or come to the aid a dog that is your own or that you have permission to help.If itaposs not your animal please do not perform CPR, first aid, or anything intrusive on them without the permission of the owner. Sothis is your animal oryou have permission to help, you would then have a look and seethereaposs anything obvious that has caused a problem, Emma says. So [the] dog is unconscious, you would NEVER do this on a dog that is conscious without extreme caution. Carefully open up the mouth and ease the tongue forward, because the tongue when they are unconscious will roll back on itself.  So they are unconscious and you need to seethey are breathing. If they are unconscious but breathing then put them into the recovery position. So extend the airways and get them to veterinary care fast Emma recommends using a piece of hair to seethe dog is expelling breathyou are unsure. To help your dog breathe, you can blow in through their nose. Guards are available to cover the nose area but you can proceed without one. If the dog is unconscious and not breathing you need to hold the nose and jaw together. Then while not breathing your full breath [as our lungs are larger than a dogs] breathe one breath every three seconds, and do five breaths initially, into the nose area. If you feel a pulse but your dog is still not breathing, increase to twenty breaths.  If your dog still isnapost breathing, youaposll need to do chest compressions. For the majority of dogs, you go just behind the front legs where the heart is positioned, for a whippet itaposs slightly more on their triangle, and for bull dogs and pug types youaposre better rolling onto their back. Continue in the ratio of thirty compressions to two breaths. If the dog has not regained consciousness after - minutes, advice from The Blue Cross says it is unlikely they will make a full recovery. However, doing all you can to help your dog whilst waiting for a vet gives them the best chance of survival.

Sue Radford, , lives in Morecambe, Lancashire, with her -year-old husband Noel and their  children. The couple excitedly announced in a YouTube video last week that they are expecting their new arrival in April. Discussing the gender of the baby at the scan, Sue said: I think boy. Iaposve got a boy feeling. Later back at home Sue adds: I was thinking girl then Iaposm thinking boy. So who knows...but now Iaposm thinking boy.  Noel adds: We saw that little nub like thing, one minute it was this way, then it was that way. One minute it looked like a girl, then it looked like a boy, so weaposre not sure. The aposnub theoryapos, used by one in ten, uses the -week scan picture to see what angle the nub - a small lump where the genitals will develop - is pointing. The theory saysthe babyaposs nub points up by  degrees or more it is a boy. Less than  degrees itaposs a girl.  Seven out of ten claim the technique accurately predicted their babyaposs sex. Speaking in the Vlog before the family went away on holiday, Noel added: Iaposm thinking a boy, but I thought that last time and then it was a girl. Sue says: When we were having the scan a few weeks ago it definitely looked looked girly because the nub was level but then at other points in the scan it was a bit raised and we were like oh, maybe it is going to be a boy. I donapost mind. Boy or girl, doesnapost matter. But boys are harder work than girls, definitely.  The couple then ask some of their other children what they would like. Oscar wants a girl because sisters are more cute along with Tillie who wants a little sister. The video starts with Sue and her husband as they head to hospital while accompanied by some of their young kids. Hopefully weaposll get to see him kicking around. Weaposre both very excited, says Sue. The footage was filmed on September th as they went for a three month scan. The touching clip showed them looking at their the screen and hearing their babyaposs heartbeat.  The couple live with the majority of their kids in the Victorian property, a former care home, which they bought almost  years ago. And now they have revealed how they manage to all live together in the -bed four-storey house, which includes a basement. The Radfords first found fame in  when their lives were the focus of a Channel  documentary called  Kids and Counting.Baby Bonnie  was the last addition to the brood in November bringing the number of children to a whopping .She arrived after a swt  minute labour weighing lb oz - and the couple, who have been having children for three decades, vowed she would be their last and had completed their family.

According to industry body the British Meat Processors Association there is currently a % shortfall of labourers in the run up to the festive season.

Also The National Pig Association said that meat process were “concerned about not fulfilling orders”. Thousands of tonnes of home grown fruit and veg is currently being left to rot in fields as migrant farm workers have deserted the UK.

But the adjustment can still cause havoc with our body clocks and it can take some time getting used to going to bed that little bit earlier. There are a few things you can do to make nodding off a bit earlier easier to ensure you donapost disturb your sleep routine too much. Even though an hour doesnapost sound like a lot, and we actually get more sleep, it can have an impact for some people on the borderline of sleep deprivation. Speaking toas part of Every Mind Matters, a new  to help people with their mental health, Dr Sara Kayat explains: An hour in itself wonapost be that signicant unless youaposre sleeping on the borderline of the recommended seven to eight hours.    If youaposre already on the cusp youaposll enter the sleep deprivation zone and it could affect you physically and mentally. Itaposs really important that you try and prioritise your sleep. You should try to go to bed an hour earlierpossible. A lot of people drink a tea after dinner, that might be okayyouaposre eating at six butyouaposre having it later you might have to cut back. You need to start thinking about it in advance, you can start giving yourself  minutes extra every night to get used to it. Our bodies have very integral body clocks. When this changes it can affect your body and it can be dficult to get back into the routine of sleep again.  In order to keep the routine as set as possible, Dr Sara suggests trying to go to bed and getting up at the same time every day, even at the weekends. As well as feeling tired, a lack of sleep have also affect us both physically and mentally.Every Mind Matters, which is backed by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle , is looking at sleep and its importance to our mental well-being."},{"url":null,"title":"man 24 wakes up discover","story":"NewsMan, , wakes up to discover he has become a multi-millionaire overnightEric Tse now owns more than  per cent of his family companys capital share after being gted a whopping £m from his parentsShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsEric Tse, , has become one of worlds richest people overnight\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

What I’ve seen since coming back is the mentality of the club changing.”And Butcher is calling on the fans to turn out in their numbers tomorrow as the Tangerines look to maintain their perfect home record on the back of three away defeats.And that kind of form, performing at two ends of the spectrum is something he and the rest of the squad are keen to put right.Butcher added: “All I can say to the fans is they need to get behind us still and they’re going to be our driving force to get us to where we need to be.“We need to make sure we’re not performing at two extremes.“We’ve been really extreme this season, going back and forth with results. The - derby win and - against Morton and then going away and losing two on the spin, you never see that coming but, ultimately, it’s about theof the season.“There’s a long way to go yet. There’s some big games coming up and people are going to drop points but we just need to go on a four, five, six-game run and make sure we’re all together, pulling in the right direction. Turnarounds from defeats can make a season.”Of opponents the Pars, Butcher added: “The last time we played them we identied that they were a strong side.“We also know that every team who plays us wants to beat us more than any other team in this league. We are the scalp in the league as such.“We need to be at % to be dominating and beating teams.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47879490-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47879490-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47879490-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.47879490-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dog from kirkton becomes instagram star after amassing nearly 30000 followers","story":"A dog from Kirkton is keeping his paws firmly on the ground after gaining international fame.Parker the samoyed has amassed nearly , followers on social media channel, Instagram.The pooch – named after Spiderman’s alter ego Peter Parker – receives messages from fans around the world, including America and China.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

Set in the Western Indian Territory just after the turn of the th century, the spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the backdrop for a love story between Curly, a handsome cowboy, and Laurey, a beautul farm girl.But the road to true love is a bumpy one, especially as sinister farm-hand Jud Fry has his sights set on Laurey, and hersquoll do whatever it takes to get her.But Laurey isnrsquot the only girl in Oklahoma with cowboy troubles. Her ditzy friend Ado Annie just loves it when a fella talks purty to her!

I have to say, he didnrsquot strike me as the typical villain.

I have some fantastic solos and I have been working on expanding my vocals to hit the powerful notes. I love having to put on an accent and Irsquove been working hard to perfect it.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for

Council will be asked rethink its controversial playparks proposals, following two petitions that were signed by over a thousand concerned residents.In May , the council agreed plans to consult on the possible closure of  small playparks it says are underused and falling into disrepair.Instead, the council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October , so it could hear from the lead petitioners and decide how to respond.Appearing before the committee, Kirsty Wichary, lead petitioner for Kelso, told councillors: ldquoWhat do we want our towns to look like in the future  Financial constraints aside, do we not look to have a beautul Borders, with outdoor spaces for all to enjoy ldquoHow did we get to this point, where there is no money for these parks  Investing in new technology for education is to be applauded, butparents had a choice, which would they choose ldquoTechnology isnrsquot helping our children to lead healthy, well-rounded lives. The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

But the firm has been dealt a major blow after its bid for a Government contract to buy the electricity produced by the windfarm failed. And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing. Guy Madgwick, CEO of Red Rock Power, which owns Inch Cape, said:ldquoWe are naturally very disappointed that our Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm project has not secured a CfD award.ldquoThe development is a culmination of over  years of hard work and signicant investment and could play an important role in both achieving the countryrsquos green energy targets and supporting economic growth.ldquoWe will now liaise closely with our supply chain to consider how best to move forward with the project, and hope to share an update as soon as possible.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, which is pushing for a ferry and cruise terminal to be investigated for the site, said the decision raised questions about Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to call in the application.He said: ldquoThis is a very worrying announcement and puts a large question mark overRed Rockrsquos planned substation at Preston Links.ldquoAt the planning enquiry last year, Red Rock placed considerable emphasis on securing a funding subsidy from the UK Government and this decision also brings into question the wisdom of the Scottish Government calling in their planning application and bypassing the local democratic planning process.East Lothian Council said it had held talks with ICOL regarding the site following the announcement and further meetings would be arranged.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand [Inch Cape] are considering all options to allow the project to progress.ldquoWe will hold a meeting with them in the near future to discuss a way forward."},{"url":null,"title":"long-awaited-port-seton-sports-hall-works-last","story":"The new facility will be part of the Port Seton Centre on the area currently used as the childrenrsquos play area it will allow the community hub to offer a wider array of activities, including indoor basketball, badminton, tennis, football and gymnastics.Some of the existing outdoor play equipment is being removed from the area to facilitate the building works, though this will be relocated to a new play area where within the park, along with the installation of some new play equipment.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure with East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe are all very excited about the construction of the new sports hall, which will be an excellent new facility for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton, complementing existing activity areas within the Port Seton Centre.ldquoWe do appreciate that there will need to be an element of disruption associated with the construction work, particularly as the new extension requires to be sited where the current childrenrsquos play park is located.ldquoWe expect to relocate elements of the existing play equipment where possible to the new area and this will be installed to coincide with the arrival of other play equipment in the coming months.ldquoWe recognise this means that there will be a temporary reduction in the amount of play equipment available within the park and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of park users at this time.

The wind had a strange mildness in its touch.His grandson was in the joy of the moment, finding shells, climbing rocks and throwing stones into the sea. His grandfather watched, wishing he too could join in the fun. But age had crept up on him. His joints tweaked with pain every time he tried to behave like his younger self, making him very cautious. So he found a rock on which to sit and watched over his grandson as he explored.His thoughts were taken away from the beach and he began to think of his we. She had dearly loved their grandson but sadly she was only an image in a photograph for her grandson now. He was too young when she died to have any real memories of her. It was at moments like this that he missed her most, for she loved the beach.

We still recognise that as we have always said these interventions have to be considered part of a live trial and very much hoping it has a positive impact on the beach.ldquoFor residents and visitors, the beach has historically been a real draw.ldquoI think everybody who has been involved recognises that it has a very signicant economic value to the town."},{"url":null,"title":"hygiene-order-served-business","story":"East Lothian Council environmental health officers served a hygiene emergency prohibition notice on Stirling Stewart, operator of a food preparation unit at Halfland Barns Industrial Estate, to the south of the town, on August , resulting in the immediate closure of the premises.The premises were not known to environmental health prior to visiting following a complaint from a member of the public.Derek Oliver, service manager, protective services, said: ldquoOfficers found the premises in such a poor condition that it posed a serious risk to public health and they immediately closed it.ldquoThe premises were filthy with a build-up of dirt and food debris, unclean food equipment, accumulation of waste and poor drainage.ldquoThe food unit was being used to supply other food businesses operated by Mr Stewart in North Berwick.In a hearing at Edinburgh Sherf Court on Tuesday, the Sherf upheld the action of the environmental health officers and confirmed the actions to immediately close the premises were legally correct.Mr Oliver added: ldquoEast Lothian Councilrsquos environmental health officers will exercise their legal powers to protect public health within the county.ldquoWe routinely inspect all food premises and expect them to comply with food hygiene regulations.ldquoIn this case the premises were so dirty and structurally poor that they required to be closed immediately as they fell far below the legally required standards."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-power-riddles","story":"THE person who uses it never sees it, the person who makes it doesnrsquot use it, the person who pays for it wishes it wasnrsquot needed. What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council. It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy. Engagement with local groups, which has been an important part of the councilrsquos support in delivering the lsquoVision for Haddington Town Centrersquo, is ongoing and we look forward to setting out more details in the months ahead."},{"url":null,"title":"wallyford-bluebell-players-fantastic-experience-soccer","story":"The county sextet were in the studio throughout the show, which went out live on Sky Sports at .am.The players for the amateur team ndash captain Daniel Howie, Jordan McCallion and brothers Jack and Shaun Moffat ndash along with friends Darren Hall and Lewis Brown, took part in the volley challenge and pro am questions to win cash.They travelled by train to London last Friday evening, with Sky covering all travel and hotel costs, as well as taxi fares to and from the studio.The trip came about after Soccer AM posted on Twitter that it was looking for Scotland fans to appear on the show.After an email from Daniel and a couple of phone calls later, the trains were booked from Edinburgh Waverley to London Kingrsquos Cross as the members of the Musselburgh Tartan Army headed south.

The night is dark and dismal. Irsquom standing on the outskirts of nowhere. On my own.No, not quite alone.I have the howling wind and crooked trees for company. And the wind gossips its terrible secrets to those trees, and the trees reply by shaking their palsied, arthritic branches in merriment. In front of me looms Provan Hall. The th century building in Easterhousersquos Auchinlea Park has a reputation for being one of the most haunted houses in Scotland.Irsquove arranged to meet a gang of ghost hunters here, though not a ghost hunter do I see. Rattling the tall gates that block my entrance to the driveway, I shout in a voice I wish sounded bolder: ldquoHello  Anybody there The wind answers with an exalted whoop. Nobody  does. With quivering fingers I tap out a message on my mobile phone to Julia Girdwood, my principal contact in the ghost hunter community.ldquoHi Julia. Irsquom at Provan Hall. There doesnrsquot seem to be anyone aroundhellipA few moments later I receive a text back. ldquoLorne. The eventrsquos tomorrow night.Oops.Chapter : In Which More Discoveries Are Made, Hideous And OtherwiseYoikes!Itrsquos a few minutes to midnight, the following evening. Irsquom crouching in the dark on the top floor of Provan Hall, when David, the professional medium standing next to me, says in a matter-of-fact voice: ldquoTherersquos a crawler coming up the stairs.A w-w-what !I glance over at the stairs. With only the dim glow from Davidrsquos torch, I make out shadows and nothing more. But David, being a medium, claims to be in possession of special powers. Ghosts are visible to him, he says, and they often tell him their tragic stories. He sometimes glimpses demons, too. Theyrsquore less sympathetic entities, as yoursquod imagine. The thing climbing the stairs towards us would appear to be of their ilk.Since I canrsquot see it, Irsquom understandably curious to know what this crawler looks like. Does it slither on flailing tentacles, or scuttle on a multitude of twitching legs ldquoIt looks sort of like Gollum, claries David, referring to the malicious creature from Lord of the Rings.David works with a group called Scottish Ghost Nights which organises a iety of spooky events throughout the country. They hold seances and late-night vigils in castles, derelict goals and stately homes.For tonightrsquos proceedings, the creepy quotient should be high, for itrsquos only a few days before Halloween, and Provan Hall has a distinctive ambience. Imagine yoursquore Hansel or Gretel, trudging through the tangled forest of your worst nightmares, when you stumble upon a sturdy, ancient house where a sweet old pensioner lives. And ndash oh joy! ndash her cooking potrsquos on the boil. Must be something yummy for dinnerhellipProvan Hall has a similar occult energy to that old pensionerrsquos gaff, though itrsquos built of sullen stone, not candy.Itrsquos a squatting toad of a house. Bathed in the clear autumn moonlight, its walls are bone-bland, pockmarked and bled of lustre, like the powdered face of a diseased French aristocrat awaiting Madame Guillotine.And Irsquom hunkered down inside that house, along with my new chum, David, another medium called Natasha, plus an assortment of ghost hunters and ghoul groupies, who paid to be here tonight, desperate to be scared witless.Therersquos twenty of us in total. Mostly women, with the occasional fear-loving fellow thrown into the mix.As the night progresses, Natasha also glimpses a demon, which she describes as looking like a ldquobarbequed monkey with not very nice eyes.David chimes in, too. ldquoItrsquos a shape-shter, he says. ldquoAnd it can climb the walls.Regrettably, once again I fail to glimpse this demon. Though being partial to anything barbequed, I do start to feel rather peckish.Luckily the ghost hunters have brought along scrummy cakes in Tupperware boxes, and we all have a hearty munch during a well-earned break. To be honest, Irsquom not really feeling the creeping sense of unease I experienced the night before, when I arrived early and alone.Itrsquos hard to get a satisfying shiver snaking down your spine when yoursquore in the company of a bunch of good-natured, cheerful ghost hunters. Wersquore all having a grand old time of it, you see, and thatrsquos a bit of a problem.A gaggle of giggling girls are on one side of me. Hen-night happy, hen-night hysterical. Also, many paying guests are wearing woolly hats topped with pom-poms. I mean, come on, guys! Would Jack Nicholson have been half as terrying in The Shininghersquod swapped his axe and manic grin for a pom-pom hat Yvonne, one of the ghost hunters, explains that therersquos nothing wrong with boisterous energy when searching for otherworldly entities. High spirits can persuade other types of spirits to make contact.Like most of the professionals here tonight, Yvonne declines to allow me to use her surname in print. She doesnrsquot want daylight acquaintances knowing her night time occupation.For all that, shersquos an earthy sort, with nothing remotely mysterious or ethereal about her personality.ldquoShout out to the spiritsyou want, she tells me. ldquoDonrsquot worry about sounding like a bit of a tool.Another ghost hunter, Eva, agrees. ldquoThink of tonight like a party, she says. ldquoYoursquove got to be single and ready to mingle. If you just stand in a corner, quiet and shy, the spirits wonrsquot be energised enough to make contact.Chapter : Of Witches, Maidens And Dastardly MonksSo our group does its best to encourage ghosts, ghoulies and other ghastlies to get in touch. Wersquore asked to briskly rub our hands together, to build up energy in the room. We also shout out questions to the invisible spirits surrounding us.ldquoWe are your friends, says David. ldquoWe have as much to learn from you, as you do from us.Little rubber balls are placed on the floor. Theyrsquore called kitten balls, rather incongruously, and when they are moved, they strobe flashing lights, like s disco balls.Shouting out questions, we encourage the spirits to answer us by shting these little balls.Occasionally a flash of light does spark through the darkness, indicating the balls are on the go. Conclusive evidence ghosts exist  Irsquom not convinced. Most likely itrsquos evidence wersquore standing in a drafty old house with rickety floorboards, where rubber balls are apt to wobble.We try a iety of other gizmos and gadgets to get in touch with the other side.An Ouija board. No luck.Then a contraption that emits strange screeches and crackles. Voices from the other side or radio interference Once again, Irsquom not persuaded.A red light is used to illuminate the faces of ious members of our group. If those faces morph into something dferent, it means a spirit is standing in front of that person. And, yes, faces do change. Sort of. Though only because the light teases shadows from the contours of noses, foreheads and mouths.The two spiritualists in our group spot more uncanny happenings. Ghosts of small children brush past, telling tales of a drowning in a pond. A hanged man swings from a banister. A pentagram on the kitchen flagstones marks the spot where a witch once worshipped. Nearby a wretched maiden was groped by a gang of dastardly monks.I glimpse none of this, however. Only the mediums see all.Julia Girdwood, whorsquos in charge of the evening, tells me events arenrsquot always dramatic, scary or opinion-shting when it comes to believingin ghosts.ldquoWe donrsquot fake anything, she says. ldquoWhich means the nights y. People sometimes come away a bit disappointed when things are quiet. Or they have a genuine uncanny experience.Speaking of which, did I come to believe, at nightrsquos end, that Provan Hall is haunted Irsquom afraid that, although I enjoyed the evening , I left forming a conclusion familiar to many a courthouse jury.

Despite the objection of the Democratic Unionist Partyand anti-abortion crusaders, it was ruled that from midnight it would be legal to have an abortion in Northern Ireland, as in the Republic of Ireland, as in the rest of the UK.With the passage of this legislation, women in the first  weeks of pregnancy who wish to have a termination will no longer have to skulk out of the country, or purchase online pills, rendering them open to prosecution should these make them so unwell they require medical attention.After next April, following an interim period during which access to services on the mainland will be freely available, the situation in Northern Ireland will change radically. Those who are pregnant as a result of incest or rape those who know their foetus has an incurable disease that will allow them little quality of le for as long as they survive those who have been told they must go full term, even though the baby has died, will finally be given a degree of dignity and comfort. At last, they will be able to end a pregnancy of their own volition, in their homeland, without stigma and with the full support of the medical professionals who tend to them.It is a not a subject for wild rejoicing, as was evident in the sombre response of campaigners on learning the law had been passed. The mood was more of relief than jubilation. Nobody can feel joy at the idea of a pregnancy that, for whatever reason, is better ended.But it is possible to feel gratitude that an old and crippling injustice, a hangover of a puritanical stranglehold on womenrsquos lives, has been overturned. As of now, Northern Irish women are entitled to decide on their own welfare and that of their unborn child. It is a right that is not only legal but ethical.That these new laws are among the most liberal in Europe is remarkable, given the strength and tenacity of opposition to this issue. It must exacerbate the fury of the anti-abortion camp to watch the political mothership in London impose its will with such vigour.That this has happened under a Conservative government with which the DUP was in partnership, is an added grievance. As is the fact that even the Republic of Ireland, once a by-word for religious conservatism, last year voted to allow terminations . This volte face was salt in the wound for pro-lers and pro-choice activists alike.The measure of how historic this landmark will prove can be gauged by the opening of the padlock on the Assemblyrsquos gates. Sinn Fein did not turn up, but Arlene Forster, leader of the DUP, announced that, despite this act, her party would explore ldquoevery possible legal option to prevent the provision of abortion services within their borders.A fuming zealot was less restrained: ldquoin todayrsquos world the most dangerous place to be is actually in the womb of a woman. There could hardly be a more calculated insult to womankind, but the depth of this manrsquos misogyny highlights the intensity of prejudice and oppression with which the pro-choice lobby has had to contend.This momentous step is good news for the United Kingdom, as is impending legislation to allow same-sex marriage from next January. All this is positive. Yet it is a sad day for the Union that both decisions, which will have far-reaching social implications, are not the work of Irish politicians but of Westminster.Since the Assembly collapsed in January , its day to day business has been handled by civil servants. You might argue they are doing such a good job they are enabling Sinn Fein and the DUP to maintain their stand-off. That not even the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee could encourage these parties to put aside their quarrel indicates the bitterness and ision at the heart of Irish politics.Yet while the Assembly has been lying all these months in an induced coma, London has not been idle. Those on the pro-choice side of the debate might have mixed feelings, since their argument has been vindicated thanks to action by the English. Time was when anything that came out of Westminster was regarded in certain quarters as toxic. How ironic, then, that the Assemblyrsquos denizens have allowed their internal wrangling, their myopia and obstinacy, to allow an often loathed overlord to step into their shoes and usher voters into a more compassionate age.That must be galling for everyone. Then again, perhaps not. When Stormont reconvened for the space of roughly an hour, squabbling made any hope of constitutional challenge impossible. It was hardly edying. Rather than acting as a reminder that the Assemblyrsquos members have the power to settle the countryrsquos affairs without interference from outside, it was instead a shambles, a pantomime whose script had been lted straight from the myth of Pandorarsquos Box.I would not be surprised , following this, some are wonderingthey should dispense with the Assembly altogether, since they are better served by panjandrums across the sea. Others, meanwhile, will be looking south towards the Republic, anticipating the time when old isions are lted, and all of Ireland is united peacefully once more.What lies between now and that day, should it ever arrive, will be turbulent, to say the least. For the meantime, it is paradox enough that it has taken Westminster to unlock the chains in which Northern Irelandrsquos women have been shackled. The symbolic signicance of this long overdue act should give the refusniks at Stormont pause for thought."},{"url":null,"title":"female-detectives-uncovering-scottish-arts-lost-women","story":"THAT Newhaven fishwe, the one with the tanned arms resting on her empty creel, head bent away aspreoccupied by something, until recently was one of the many women in the National Galleries of Scotland collections whose inidual lives we really knew little of.Mara Barth, project learning officer, scatters a collection of early photographs across a table and tells me that all these women are unknown. Itrsquos a feature not just of these images, but of many paintings and photographs of women in the National Galleries of Scotlandrsquos historic collections, and in many art collections across the world.Sometimes the only title these subjects get is ldquounknown woman, or \"four unknown women\". Sometimes it is ldquowe of, or ldquodaughter of. One sits on a motorbike. ldquoWe know a little bit about her, because we got curious and we liked her motorbike. We found out where this motorbike was registered, and it was in Morningside and we know that this was a type of bike designed for ladies.ldquoThere are a lot of female sitters in the collection, says Barth, ldquobut we often donrsquot know a lot about the sitters. This event is around exploring not just women artists but women sitters in the collection and specically around the Scottish collection. Wersquove drawn images from the early photography collection that are of unknown women. Nothing is known about any of these women. Or course in the early photography there is quite a lot of unknown men as well as women. This is a nice way to highlight some of the everyday women of Scotland. Early photographs were where we see them the most.Some of these anonymous women are at the centre of an event at the National Galleries Of Scotland titled, Where Are The Women  Itrsquos an interesting title, for, actually,you walk around any of our galleries, you do see plenty of women. There are nudes, classical goddesses, queens, ladies in their fine hats and gowns. But what feels absent too often is a sense of who some of these women really are. Thatrsquos particularly so when the women are working class.One of the inspirations behind this evening event is feminist author Sara Sheridanrsquos Where Are The Women : A Guide To An Imagined Scotland, which created a new map of the country, in which many of the statues of men that populate our streets were replaced by those to women or the roads renamed to memorialise women not men.ldquoIrsquom interested in the memorialisation of women, says Sheridan, who will speak at the National Galleries event, \"and when I wrote my book to remap Scotland, I discovered amazing things about our foremothers. We need to normalise womenrsquos achievement, we need to normalise womenrsquos voices and we need to normalise womenrsquos bodies as well. My book is one creative take on that.Sheridan acknowledges that in the National Galleries of Scotland the problem is not a blanket absence of women of the sort we see among the statues in our streets. Images of the female sex are plenty, though, in the historic collection, the vast majority of them are created by men. One of the problems is, though, she says, that these women are edited. An example she gives of this is the Victorian nudes.ldquoWhen we do see them theyrsquore not real people, theyrsquore statues. There is no body hair or anything like that and they all had these mad hairstyles. They were meant to look like statues and statues donrsquot have hair. The Victorians were inspired by statues from Greece and were painting women to look like that.She believes this editing of women is still relevant now. ldquoI founded Reek, a perfume company where when you wear the perfume you form a memorial to the women it commemorates. I want to talk about the way womenrsquos bodies are represented because thatrsquos something we care about at Reek. We donrsquot retouch images. We get a lot of complaints on Facebook becauseyou put up a lot of skin and nudes itrsquos taken down, and of course perfume photography is all about skin and nudes.The National Galleries of Scotland event is another take on the kind of memorialising of women that Sheridan does. It also reflects a kind of righting of a wrong, an attempt to uncover more ndash for instance more about that Newhaven fishwe, taken in .The image is iconic. Itrsquos one of which the early th century philosopher, Walter Benjamin, wrote, ldquoShe has something that canrsquot be silenced, something that fills you with an unruly desire to know what her name was, the woman that was alive there. The early th century philosopher happened to be looking at a copy of the photograph that had no name attached. Frequently the image was published, nameless, with other titles like ldquoNewhaven beauty or even ldquoNewhaven Madonna. Yet we do know the name of this young woman. its creators, Hill  Adamson, the first Scottish photography studio, did publish it, and, in the past few years, armed with that piece of information, the researcher and photographer Caroline Douglas has made it her mission to discover and understand this working-class woman, ElizabethHall, to bring her story to light.ldquoI really just wanted to build up a picture of Elizabeth Johnstone Hallrsquos le. There has been a lot of scholarship on Hill  Adamson, but it really struck me that there hadnrsquot been a great deal written about the iniduals, the unknown subjects, who sat for them. So my approach has really been from a dferent vantage point, the study of the history of photography from the perspective of the sitter, and very much so in this case, a working class sitter. I really think our understanding of the emergence of photography as a discipline changes when we begin to write these unknown figures into the history of the medium.These are some of the worldrsquos earliest photographic subjects, which is extraordinary in itself. And also they represent one of the first photo documentary series ever made. You have these living breathing subjects. And yet we still donrsquot know all that much about them.What do we now know  ldquoTherersquos a wedding band there on her finger, she says. ldquoShe was born Johnstone. And she married Daniel Hall and in the Scots tradition she kept both her maiden name and her married name. She was married but didnrsquot have any children. Sadly she died in relative poverty, though at quite an old age ndash in , the same year as Victoria died. They died within days of one another.One of the things she doesnrsquot know for sure is what awareness the subjects in these photos would have had of the circulation of the images. She also very much doubts that she would have been given a copy of the image, or invited on the occasions when they were exhibited. ldquoIn my research Ive learned that many of these iniduals werent literate. In the census records Ive been consulting, bold strokes or black marks where someone has been unable to sign their name.But one of the most fascinating things about her research into Johnstone Hall, is that it took a more personal twist when Douglasrsquos mother noticed a tweet about her research. She sent her a message, saying, ldquoCaroline, you know wersquove got both Johnston Halls and Listons [the name of a male subject in the photographs] in the family.ldquoIn my pursuit of trying to understand women in early photography, Irsquom finding Irsquom perhaps related to both the fishermen and women in the picture, she says.Douglas has an interest not just in the sitters ndash but also in the processes of early photography and the women who might have been involved in that. One thing she has been exploring is that there was a female technician on the Hill  Adamson project. There was also, she found, much further back, an Edinburgh woman who was key to developing some of the chemical processes that would lead to early photography. ldquoElizabeth Fulhame was doing chemistry experiments in Edinburgh in s, fty years before the founding fathers are deemed to have invented photography. And yet her work forms part of the bedrock of the invention of the medium. In the foreword of her book Fulhame writes, lsquoCensure is perhaps inevitable for some are so ignorant that they grow sullen and silent and are chilled with horror at the sight of anything that bears the semblance of learning ndash and should the spectre appear in the shape of a woman the pangs which she suffers are truly dismal.\"Itrsquos not an uncommon feeling, that desire expressed by Walter Benjamin to know more about the person featured in a portrait. Itrsquos one many visitors appear to feel around a popular painting in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Daniel Macneersquos A Lady In Grey.Gallery attendants have said they frequently are asked questions about this painting, long known to be a portrait of the artistrsquos daughter, Isabella Wiseman. ldquoYou look at her, says Freya Spoor, a curator at the National Galleries of Scotland, ldquoand want to know more. Yoursquore intrigued by her immediately. And she has a wonderful intimacy because they were father and daughter and I think they were very close. I think they had a similar sense of humour. Interested to uncover more, Spoor started looking into the object files and found that they also have two photographs of Isabella Wiseman donated by the descendants. ldquoOne has her in a similar post to Lady in Grey. She was an elderly lady at that point, sitting with her hands clapped in front of her.The photographs were given to the gallery by a descendent called Dr Ruth Wazzell, and she discovered that the family also had an archive at the National Library of Scotland. ldquoI was able to go and look at that. Lovely anecdotal information on her ndash about going to all the Royal Academy shows, going to the theatre. I think she had quite a keen sense of humour. You sort of felt like you were getting more of a personal picture of what Isabella was like.The Where Are The Women  event, while it does have a focus on sitters, is also about asking where women are in all areas of art production, and that includes the artists themselves. Spoor notes that there are gaps where they shouldnrsquot be. The reasons why womenrsquos works are missing are hugely ied. Artworks by Frances Maconald McNair, for instance are far fewer than they might be, because her husband, Herbert McNair, burned much of her studio work on her death. ldquoIt is a curious Victorian phenomenon to deal with grief, or it could be reputation-saving. But it happened quite regularly.Also doing a talk at one of the events are The History Girls, Rachael Purse and Karen Mailley-Watt. Their focus is ldquofriendship portraits, the paintings female artists have done of each other. She observes that when it comes to finding women in history, whether in written sources or art, where you have to look is in ldquothe gaps.ldquoWomen are often not mentioned at all, unless you look. For instanceyou look at the Chronicles of Charlemagnersquos rule some of his wives arenrsquot even mentioned by name but the children are mentioned so you have to guess who they are or where they are from by the mention of their children. You have to play detective because for a lot of history women are regarded as irrelevant so their names arenrsquot used a lot. Up until s, women became a legal nonentity upon marriage. Officially she didnrsquot exist. She wasnrsquot dead legally, but she wasnrsquot alive, she was just like an extra limb of her husband.Purse also notes that the lack of womenrsquos art prior to the th century is partly a reflection of the role they were expected to take in families. ldquoAs soon as they became pregnant or got married they were no longer able to practice art, and those that were able to do it up to that point were dependent on parents allowing them to do so and that generally meant only middle class people. The art that is produced by these women is just kept by the family usually. It doesnrsquot get sold and seen and written about by critics and collected by museums. Itrsquos in peoplersquos housesldquoWhat I find upsetting, she adds, ldquois that so many of these womenrsquos periods as artists are cut short by getting married or by a family, maybe theyrsquore unmarried but a father gets ill and theyrsquore the only unmarried daughter left so they have to stop then look after the household and their father. Itrsquos really sad when you see the abrupt stop.\"Frequently those artists who have risen to the kind of prominence that has seen their work in historical collections have not had children. One of these is Flora Macdonald Reid, an artist that Freya Spoor has recently researched. ldquoHer brother, Spoor says, ldquowas John Robertson Reid and her sister Lizzie was also an artist. She travelled extensively across Europe: France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and she incorporated exciting aspects which were reshaping art, rural naturalism. She was looking at rural people who were within the local area, real local flavour and presenting them in a really honest way. The muddy boots, the weather-beaten face.Macdonald Reid never married. ldquoI think, says Spoor, ldquothat was so she could focus on her art entirely. She dedicated her le to her artwork. She exhibited widely and in places where her work would have been seen on a par with men. She could command similar prices to her male counterparts.Of course, some very noteworthy female artists did have children and made motherhood the subject of some of their work. In Romance, Cecile Walton, produced a post-birth self-portrait, in which she depicts herself partially undressed, in a pose reminiscent of Manetrsquos Olympia. She holds up her baby and peers as it. Her older child plays at her feet.As Spoor puts it, ldquoItrsquos quite inquiring of motherhood generally. I think she was quite perplexed by this new child and what the future held for her. Itrsquos very honest in that way and itrsquos extremely relevant for themes today. She was mirroring other artistic tropes so you could say like Manetrsquos Olympia and further back to Titianrsquos Venus of Urbino. Itrsquos extremely honest and frank and I think it was considered quite shocking at the time.\"The Where Are The Women  event is part of a process of uncovering, of bringing women into the light. Researchers are gradually revealing that the female artist was not quite the rare beast that is often made out ndash but that unearthing her takes hard work. They are like detectives seeking out the women in art.ldquoIf itrsquos not one of the big names like Margaret Macdonald, or Phoebe Anna Traquair or Jessie M King, says Rachael Purse, ldquothe names wersquove heard of, then it become dficult. So you have to have a passion. I love Margaret Macdonald Macintosh and Joan Eardley, but they didnrsquot exist in a vacuum. These other people existed. Shocker.

For many undecided Scottish voters this sort of alternative appears to appeal ndash it avoids the big leap while still rejecting arrangements as they are today.But federalisation or any form of a signicantly re-imagined UK is never going to happen. My experiences as an undergraduate at Oxford taught me at least that much. The English elite simply have no interest in a radical reform. While the discourse along this theme rages on north of the Border, the silence in the south-east of England roars a definitive ldquono. Sweeping reform simply isnrsquot on the radar. Andit werenrsquot after a heartfelt vow to change was made on the eve of the  poll and % still voted Yes, it is never going to be.:Lobby row Ruth Davidson set up her own consultancy firm  days agoBecause in a ldquoprecious union of nations, as the nauseatingly insincere phrase goes, we would have said that given two nations rejected Brexit and the overall result in that referendum was narrow, we should leave but in a very soft form. A Union that respects the views of all its nations would allow for flexible arrangements where Scotland could have a deal tailored to its needs and respecting its anti-Brexit vote. But no such recognition of national dferences within the UK came Scotlandrsquos way. On Wednesday we even heard from the Prime Minister that the devolved legislatures have no role whatsoever in consenting to the Brexit deal ndash a claim as outrageous as it is erroneous.For most of the southern English who go on to rule the UK roost, Scotland piques interest only for carefully selected performative acts. At Oxford the usual crowd of boys schooled in England with refined English accents and London homes would don their kilts for formal dinners and balls. Burns Night is one such favoured occasion of the Scottish-when-it-suits-me cohort. And then therersquos the annual English middle-class pilgrimage to Edinburgh for the Fringe.Scotland deserves better than the disregard the English demonstrate the rest of the year.As much as our Westminster leaders profess their deep love of the Union, it feels much more like a love of the cultural prestige Scotland affords England and a fear of the symbolic blow to the UK that would come with independence.Better to look at what the UK Government does in relation to Scotland than continue to listen to the endless stream of verbal assurances insisting they care.I do believe the English and Scots have broadly the same values. The talk of Scottish progressiveness has probably been somewhat overdone in a country which in my letime had a private postal ballot on whether to continue banning discussion of gay peoplersquos existence from schools. But that is irrelevant. Where the Scottish and English erge is in voting behaviour. If the UK had not ed a Conservative government driven by English votes in , there never would have been a Brexit referendum that no one outside a rabid fringe was calling for. If the English had voted like the Scottish in that referendum, we would not still potentially be just days away from a catastrophic No-Deal Brexit that no one said was on the cards. But here we are.:MPs could hold Boris Johnson hostage over Brexit dateVoting patterns matter more than the values professed in polling. Voting choices have put us in the dire straits the UK is in today. And a voting choice can extract Scotland from this vicious cycle of disappointment with a UK seemingly hell-bent on damaging not just Scots but everyone  in Britain too.In recent weeks the possibility of border controls between Scotland and England has been raised in the event of independence. Our borders are best when theyrsquore invisible. There is a group which shares that view and has demonstrated its commitment to it through action. Itrsquos the European Union. If controls appear at the Border with an independent Scotlandin the EU, it will only be because the English have chosen not to sign up to the European norm, not because Scotland, like the vast majority of Europe, will have chosen to do so.As an Englishman due tosouth of that Border in February, I can only hope the rest of the UK would re-assess the situation in light of the new realities of a post-independence world and join Scotland and Ireland back in the EU. The choice will be for the rest of the UK to make.I am by no means wedded to the idea of independence. Through serious reform Canada redefined itself after Quebec voted by less than . per cent against splitting off in . Itrsquos an outcome the Queacutebeacutecois seem happy with, as independence is no longer under serious discussion.

It certainly doesnrsquot suggest a lean and prudent operation.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish National Investment Bank has the potential to transform Scotlandrsquos economy, and requires a CEO with the appropriate skills and experience to be able to lead such a high profile financial institution.ldquoIt is common practice at this level in the financial or public sector for a recruitment agency to be used to help to attract the best and most erse possible field of candidates."},{"url":null,"title":"public-fed-brexit-delays","story":"But for Antony McCallum, his own blend, House of McCallum, is everything.Yesterday afternoon Mr McCallum had  pallets of bottles ready to ship to France, his big market, for his Christmas push.ldquoThis time of year accounts for about  per cent of our sales, he said, then lamented: ldquoThe hauliers are not surethey will be able to ship or not. They donrsquot knowthe trucks will go.ldquoI have been in business for  years but I have never known uncertainty like this. Normally, you can plan you canrsquot plan when you donrsquot know what is going on.And he is worried, like so many others. Bigger businesses, Mr McCallum admitted, have been squeezing him out.They are finding it easier to bulk import the extra supplies of vital components, like the bottles, corks and caps, that they need. Business groups describe a real toll on the confidence of smaller entrepreneurs.Mike Cherry, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, this week warned his members had ldquobeen left hamstrung by uncertainty for the past three years.One of the big worries for businesses is whether they can get labour, including seasonal workers, from the EU.But the four million or so citizens of other European nations living in the UK have reason to be stressed.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon symbolically again told them they were welcome in Scotland. But Brexit has delivered a dferent message ndash one that has added to the stress.Those in favour of Brexit insisted we were supposed to take back control. Instead, for people like Mr McCallum and so many others, there is just an overwhelming sense that even before any deadline runs out, we have lost it.The United Kingdom yesterday lurched into yet another Brexit extension, the date of which is still to be decided, into yet another period of aching political, economic and constitutional uncertainty.For some this was just the prolonged death rattle of the British Union state, a last agony. For others, it was more like a dficult and protracted delivery for a new sovereignty outside the European Union, a rebirth. But forget the destination.It is the pain of the journey that is hurting, the mental pain. Why  Because people are telling us they canrsquot control what is happening. And because they simply donrsquot know what is happening.There is more: all of this angst and anxiety, this discord and dispute, this stress and strain, looks set to last right through the holiday season. As the nights turn darker quicker and the cold seeps in, there is talk of a December General Election, of politics over the turkey and trimmings.The wry jokes have started as coping mechanisms click in. Merry Brexmas, say some, and a happy No EU year  As is so often the case when we donrsquot feel right in ourselves, it is our friends who notice. And not just the bad gags. First, foreign observers have used the language of mental health to describe the Brexit process itself.ldquoBritain had gone mad, said the New York Times in the summer. ldquoThe cult of Brexit has driven the Tory party to go mad, said Internazionale in Italy. Aghast commentary does nothing to calm British nerves.Neither, say mental health experts, do headlines that stigmatise illness. Some outside are really starting to worry about us.Take Brian Hughes, of the National University of Ireland in Galway.ldquoWhile we may in Ireland laugh at the UK, it is very stressful for the people in the UK, the psychologist told the .ldquoIt has realconsequences for peoplersquos wellbeing and mental health. There are multiple major concerns you would have for a nation like the UK and its population.Anti-depressant prescriptions shot up  per cent in the month after the big Brexit vote. They are supposed to go down in the summer months.We are less than a week from the latest Brexit deadline. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would ldquodie in a ditch rather than stay in the EU beyond Halloween.And yet it looks like October  will pass and we will still be in the worldrsquos biggest and most successful trading bloc.Back in March, days out from a previous deadline, the Mental Health Foundation issued research showing Brexit had made % of people in Scotland feel powerless.Another % were angry, another % worried. Nearly one in five of us are highly stressed, according to the poll. Toni Giugliano, the foundationrsquos policy manager, said: ldquoFeelings of powerlessness or worry are linked to a higher risk of mental health problems. They may also exacerbate existing dficulties.ldquoWe know, from other examples worldwide, that an unstable political environment can potentially affect peoplersquos mental health.ldquoThe number of people who said they felt high levels of stress or problems sleeping is also a concern.Mr Giugliano was speaking in March. Six months on he added that little had changed, but underlined the stress was not being dispersed equally. Some of us are more affected than others: EU migrants or people in businesses that trade with the EU, or for projects that get funding from the EU.German-born Professor Tanja Bueltmann, of Northumbria University, studies migration and also campaigns for citizensrsquo rights.She said: ldquoFor EU citizens, Brexit is not a threat of something that might happen in the future: it has been their everyday le for over , days, no end in sight. There is a real human cost to living in limbo for such an extended period, with growing tangible evidence documenting the impact of this uncertainty.ldquoIn particular, the mental health of EU citizens is affected, impacts ranging from anxiety to depression and panic attacks.ldquoEspecially worrying, however, is the growing number of accounts that reveal EU citizens holding suicidal thoughts. This is the result too of many EU citizens finding themselves in a real crisis of identity and belonging. This was bound to happen: how are they meant to come to terms with the fact the place they consider their home chose to implement a system that forces them to apply to stay [rather than an automatic system as was promised] ldquoWhatever happens next, the impact Brexit has had on EU citizens has already been signicant and is likely to have longer-term negative consequences for their mental health and wellbeing.In Europe there are also British citizens who were bracing themselves again for the prospect of a no-deal Brexit as soon as next week.This summer a study found three out of four British parliamentarians were suffering from poor mental health stress and depression. One of its authors, Dan Poulter, a Tory MP who still works as an NHS psychiatrist, stressed the work was lonely.Speaking in July, he added: ldquoMPs are potentially at greater risk of developing mental health problems because of the nature of their work and because they work in a high-stress environment where there are many brickbats and not many bouquets.Brexit has not made things easier. An MP was murdered by an extremist during the EU campaign. Crowds of often aggressive campaigners have gathered outside Parliament.Abuse on social media is re. A huge poll this week found a majority of voters think violence towards MPs is a price worth paying to get the Brexit outcome they want.Even the research team behind the survey, at Edinburgh and Cardf universities, said they found the findings ldquogenuinely shocking.Hannah Bardell is one of the MPs who have spoken frankly about looking after themselves as Brexit eats into their ability to do normal politics.She said: ldquoThat job, which I love and which I signed up for ndash and for all the stress that comes with it ndash has had quite a profound impact on my mental health.An MP since , Ms Bardell catalogued the stresses being forced on politicians.ldquoThe dysal system at Westminster the relentless wall-to-wall nonsense of Brexit not being able to do our job the way we should be because Brexit is taking up so much energy. All of that is having an impact on people and parliamentarians of all parties.So far studies have focused on adults but the pain is rubbing off on their children. The Mental Health Foundation has advice: donrsquot bottle it up. ldquoHave an honest discussion with them, be truthful, give them facts, and allow plenty of time for questions, it says. ldquoRemember that small doses of real time news are helpful, but overexposure is not."},{"url":null,"title":"excellent response to call for new members","story":"Dozens of folk have signed up to become Bailies of Bennachie during the first half of October.The conservation group is having a push on membership this month with all new members being entered into a prize draw for a voucher for afternoon tea for two at Pittodrie House Hotel.The group’s outreach officer, Fiona Cormack, explained: “It is wonderful to have had such apositive response so far.“A social media campaign is featuring inidual Bailies saying why they are members.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmThe spoils were shared in a pulsating eight-goal thriller between Orkney FC and Golspie Sutherland in Dounby this afternoon.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This scheme will include looking at prehistoric seafaring and what the Isles were like thousands of years ago, what travel would have been like between the isles with very dferent sea levels. Shipwrecks will also be considered — uncovering more information about wrecks around the isles, looking at any that might still be unrecorded and sharing anecdotes and stories passed down through families and between friends. One aspect of the project will look at maritime cultural landscapes and how sea links and industries have shaped the character of each isle. Maritime art will also be explored in more detail in each island including the possibility of creating an art exhibition or trail that is inspired by the maritime nature of the isles.   Andy Golightly, programme manager for the North Isles Landscape Partnership said: “If people get involved in this project as well as the opportunity to find out more about maritime history and perhaps add to the existing research there will be the chance to learn new and interesting skills including surveying, mapping and even expanding their creative and artistic abilities too”     Natalia Bain from Wessex Archaeology added: “We have arranged a series of information events across isles so people can find out more about the project, the opportunities for involvement and what they would like to research.” Information sessions about the project will be held throughout next week. This includes events at Sanday Community School on Monday, October  Westray Junior High on Tuesday, October  St Ann#s Community Room in Papa Westray on Wednesday, October  Eday Heritage Centre on Thursday, October  North Ronaldsay Community Centre on Friday, November  and at the Boathouse in Shapinsay on Saturday, November .Dates in Stronsay and Rousay, Eglisay and Wyre are to be confirmed.For further information, you can contact the North Isles Landscape Partnership Scheme via its Facebook Page.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This further three month delay is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland needed, given the ongoing uncertainty it creates.“It seems that every time Ministers make an announcement the deadline for the new contract gets pushed back.

The Hector Russell kiltshop preserved much of the original  Princes Street but a coffee chain has now taken over the building. I’m too disappointed to look inside.Instead I cross Hanover Street and pass the boarded-up Royal Overseas League, some of the giant stores about to relocate to the St James and what will soon be Poundland. Then the curious site of three phone shops in a row, all flogging the same technology and the same deliberately confusing tarfs. Then it’s the end of the road,  Princes Street, currently taking shape as a £m Johnnie Walker Whisky Experience. I stop and look back.It wasn’t as bad as I’d expected and the street is still busy but the worst is yet to come when the big department stores close, as close they will in the next few years.The solution for Princes Street has to be dferent.

It does not make economic sense to withdraw our markets in the EU, for the sake of other markets within the USA. It is not only this, but the tax payer will foot the bill for negotiating trade with the USA, where, as mentioned, it will be under the USA#s control, terms and conditions. The tax payer will also foot the bill for any trade deal arrangement where the USA will benefit immensely with a # forced to take it or leave it # scenario for the UK citizen.

They should have a steady stream of Gaelicspeakers coming through the primary school now, so we’d be delighted to seethem back and entering choral and other competitions.“The same goes for Lochaber, where there is also a Gaelic school, and for Inverness Royal Academy, the school which pupils of Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Inbhir Nis go on to attend.#Mr Morrison added: “It’s often said that youngsters need more opportunity for speaking Gaelic outside of a school setting – and the Mòd should be the ideal  for that.“If Nicolson and Sir E Scott canmanage to come every year, there’s no reason why Portree couldn’t.“We’d love to see them back on stage when the Mòd comes to Inverness next year.”MEANWHILE, singers from Back and Benbecula qualied in first place for Thursday night#s Traditional Gold Medal final.Isabelle Bain, a -year-old postgraduate law student at Glasgow University, won the Moray Trophy in the women#s qualying competition.She has ed to competitive singing after a three year break, and tonight will be her third appearance in the prestigious final.Alasdair Iain MacPhee, from Nunton in Benbecula, leads the men#s competition after winning the Lochaber Rotary Club trophy.The -year-old works as a Gaelic primary teacher at Winhill School in Greenock, and is competing at his first ever Mòd, having been persuaded by his pupils to take part.Both Alasdair and Isabelle scored  out of  and, as a result, they shared the Donald Murray memorial trophyGlasgow gaels also won both of the Gold Medal singing competitions held om Wednesday.The men#s Gold Medal was won by Ruairidh Alasdair MacLennan, a BBC reporter from Glasgow, but with family connections to South Uist.The women#s prize was won by teacher Clare MacAulay, originally from Ness in Lewis."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_2889.jpg","title":"premier mod choral prize for back gaelic choir in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCòisir Sgire a# Bhac # Back Gaelic Choir # enjoyed a day of success during Thursday#s rural choral competitions at the Royal National Mòd in Glasgow The Lewis choristers won the Lorn Shield, with fellow islanders Carloway and Lochs completing the contest#s top three.Bùrach, a choir mainly from the Morvern area, won the Sherf MacMaster memorial quaich.It is the third year in succession that the choir, led by Riona Whyte, has won the coveted prize.competition.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

Is it a bird  Is it a plane  No, it’s a hawk-shaped kite designed to scare away seagulls and other sky-borne nuisances. Graciously circling overhead like birds of prey on the hunt, two faux hawks are simply attached to a line and pole, which is mounted to the roof of the fast food restaurant, rising and falling with every change in the wind. Passers-by could be forgiven for being startled when the kite is whipped into action by a gentle breeze that helps keep the seagulls at bay . Historically, seagulls have lived near the sea or sometimes beside rivers and reservoirs, but they have increasingly been found in inland towns and cities where they are often viewed as pests by the urban population.The problem is made worse by the fact that the main culprit is the herring gull – one of the largest and most aggressive members of the gull family on the island of Ireland.One reason for the growth in the number of gulls is the relative safety for the birds of perches atop man-made structures, where gulls commonly build their nests out of the reach of predators.Another reasons that gulls have moved inland is the abundant supply of food waste, which helps sustain them. No surprise, then, that they might flock to supermarkets, shops and food outlets like McDonald’s.While retailers, local government authorities, and restaurants have been keen to limit the birds’ access to food waste by using lidded bins and encouraging proper disposal, the urban gull perseveres. The daring and intelligent birds have been known to swoop down on humans to snatch food from their hands – an obvious danger when you’re trying to eat a Big Mac. While the law makes it illegal to recklessly injure or kill any gull or damage or destroy an active nest or its contents, it does, in the interest of health and safety, make allowances for certain control measures, and there are few more clever – or more humane – than the kite hawk. The urban gulls have been the subject of human concern leading, in some cases, to lethal methods of control. However, given that they are a red-list threatened species, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds questions the use of lethal control as a means of dealing with the issue.A less aggressive method of control – like that employed by McDonald’s at Westwoods – is just one solution that may help our co-habitation. At the very least, your McNuggets are somewhat safer."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"welsh fm%e2%80%88calls for bridge building at belfast","story":"THE First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford AM was in Belfast on Friday when he appealed for bridge-building across the Irish Sea despite the headwinds of Brexit.The Welsh premier made the appeal at the gala banquet of the Belfast International Homecoming in City Hall.He also said he was envious of the strong global Irish American networks – which were represented at the three day Homecoming event which showcased the best of Belfast to the Irish diaspora.Mr Drakeford praised the “well organised diaspora” of Ireland and Scotland for promoting their country’s “practical interests around the globe”, but called for better self-organisation to protect Welsh interests in the context of Brexit.“There are Welsh people, too, around the world,” he said.“They are just as passionate about their identity and the home from which they have sprung – but they don’t yet operate in that organised way we see in this room.“For us, that means we have to work harder – and harder still in the headwinds of Brexit – to sustain our profile and our unique identity on the international stage. Since I became First Minister, in December last year, we have an International Relations Minister in our Cabinet – an idea completely unthinkeable at the start of devolution. We have a highly regarded International Strategy, which is being discussed and debated across Wales.”Mr Drakeford stressed the importance of forging links between people on “dferent sides of the Irish Sea”, particularly those from “Celtic nations”.“Amongst us all are links of language, of history, of culture, of economic identity and, in many instances of progressive political outlook,” he said.“We all share the presence of a powerful neighbour, with a global and dominant language and a well-developed sense of its own signicance. In the Brexit context – and beyond it too – we have had the best results, I believe, when we have been able to work together, in an informal Celtic alliance, to provide a more powerful counterweight to hard line leave propositions than we could have mobilised working on our own.“And in the dficult days ahead, I think the effort to identy common interests, to act with a sense of solidarity in their pursuit, and to create outcomes which work for us all – that effort will be needed as never before.”"},{"url":null,"title":"european union free to promote irish unity sinn fein mep claims","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The remainderwas spent on legal fees.With an average wait of . years to resolve a claim, there was a total of , cases open at any one time in this -month period.These cases have so far racked up a bill of £m, including £m on legal costs.Over the period,  new cases were opened,  were closed while , cases remained open and  were settled.The annual spend has dropped by £.m compared to  , but the amount of cases open at any time has increased by nearly .Former DUP Health Minister Edwin Poots said that while many cases were genuine, too many patients are being encouraged to start unnecessary claims against health trusts.Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan added that in some cases a lack of transparency from health authorities over mistakes had also added to the costs.The report, published yesterday, defines negligence as \"a breach of duty of care by members of the health and social care professions employed byorganisations or by others consequent on decisions or judgments made by members of those professions acting in the course of their employment, and which are admitted as negligent by the employer or determined as such through the legal process\".The cost for   broken down by area was:Belfast Trust - £,,.Legacy HSS Boards - £,,.Western Trust - £,,.Southern Trust - £,,.Northern Trust - £,,.South Eastern Trust - £,,.NI Ambulance Blood Transfusion Service - £,.Over half of casesopen in   related to four specialities. Those were: Obstetrics , Accident and Emergency , General Surgeryand Trauma and Orthopaedics .Mr Poots said all claims need to be scrutinised.\"There is a culture out there to make claims from health trusts and theres companies that specialise in it and advertise,\" he said.\"That includes cold calling people to do this. This is a major problem for health providers everywhere.\"Mr Poots said it was still important to recognise genuine claims where \"catastrophic harm has been done\".\"I know that I received a phone call one day from a solicitor askingI wanted to claim for bad treatment I received in hospital,\" he said.\"I absolutely devoured them on the phone, but there are some people taking them up on the offer.\"That is a problem that exists today. I always encouraged the trusts to settle things quickly to avoid and to not allow legal fees to pile up.\"Mr Sheehan, a Sinn Fein MLA for West Belfast, said that efforts to address mistakes had not always been patient-centred, with a lack of transparency from health authorities making things worse in some cases.\"Often the emotional impact and trauma experienced by patients is greatest where health authorities have failed to accept their mistakes,\" he said.\"The HSC system must work towards a culture of openness and accountability.\"Negligence shouldnt be understood exclusively as a financial cost to the health budget but in terms of the value we place on an open and transparent health and social care system.\"A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"Budgetary provision is made each year for clinical negligence costs.\"The reality is that clinical negligence expenditure fluctuates each year. The department monitors clinical negligence expenditure levels closely each month.\"Clinical negligence issues are a reality in health systems across the world.\"Continuing focus on patient safety and governance is a highly important priority.\""},{"url":null,"title":"foster blames varadkar for setting precedent over violent resistance","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I said so at the time.“Because you can’t use the threat of violence to achieve something.“And that unfortunately now has set a precedent where people from loyalism are looking at that, and they’re saying ‘hold on a second, he used that in that particular way, so now we’re going to use that’.“That’s wrong. That is not the way forward.”Ms Foster said loyalist concerns about the Brexit deal were understandable.“I am not dismissing, and I want to be very clear on this, fears and concerns of the loyalist community, or indeed unionist middle class people, or anybody in unionism at the moment, because actually unionism and loyalism are all at one relation to this deal – they are rejecting it,” she said.“So instead of talking about loyalist violence in relation to that, let’s deal with those fears.“And let’s deal with those concerns in a way that addresses them.“And the way to do that, of course, is to try and deal with those issues aroundconsent and the concerns that we have around customs.”In response to Ms Foster’s remarks, a spokesman for the Taoiseach said: “The Irish Government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.“Protecting peace on the island of Ireland has and always will be our overriding objective.“It should be clear to everyone that Brexit itself has disturbed the political equilibrium in Northern Ireland.“It’s the main reason why the Irish Government was against it.“We have never wanted any new borders neither North-South nor in the Irish Sea.“Unfortunately, leaving the EU customs union and single market requires that checks must now happen somewhere.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nigel dodds brands current brexit agreement economic madness","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rushmount is even referred to in Architectural Heritage of Malone and Stranmillis by Paul Larmour, a book recording the rich heritage of buildings of interest in the area. Built in an arts and craft style, this exquisite  sq ft home retains many of its beautul and original features such as period mahogany fireplaces, oak flooring, cornice ceilings and bay and leaded glass windows, all of which complement its charm and character.The five-bedroom property features an open porch and solid mahogany front door leading to an impressive reception hall.A further five reception rooms include a generous lounge, dining and family room.

I am very grateful to everyone who supported me — all the Russian citizens who helped and wrote me letters and donated money for my defence,” she said.The former American University graduate student pleaded guilty last December to conspiring to act as an unregistered agent for Russia.She admitted that she and a former Russian politician worked to leverage contacts in the National Rle Association to pursue back channels to American conservatives.Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman, who also met Butina at the airport, said the -year-old is a victim of entrenched anti-Russian attitudes.“This is what, unfortunately, the previous US administration started — trying to destroy the bilateral relationship,” Maria Zakharova said.I am very, very, very happy to be back home. I am very grateful to everyone who supported meMaria ButinaSince the election of President Donald Trump, Russian officials have consistently blamed troubled relations on so-called “Russophobia” carried over from the administration of President Barack Obama.“She really did no harm to anybody. She’s just a girl, she’s just a young woman. She tried to invest her youth,you wish, her gt, her talent, into people-to-people contacts,” Ms Zakharova said.Butina’s case was highly criticised in Russia and the foreign ministry underlined the position by using her face as the avatar on its Facebook page. That was changed to the Russian double-eagle symbol after her .Butina violated US law because she did not report her efforts to the Justice Department, which requires the registration of lobbyists and others in the US who do the bidding of foreign governments.She was sentenced to  months in prison but received credit for time already served.Her lawyers said on Friday that she was not a spy and that the case had nothing to do with espionage or election interference.

The delay is due to issues relating to routine testing of the Fluenz Tetra nasal flu vaccine by the manufacturer and is not related to the safety or the efficacy of the vaccine. Work is under way to minimise potential disruption to the childhood flu immunisation programme in the Northcaused by this. In line with the rest of the UK the Chief Medical Officer has requested GP’s prioritise children with underlying health conditions and pre-schoolers over the age of two. googletag.cmd.push Dr Gerry Waldron, Assistant Director of Public Healthat the PHA, said: “We have been exploring how to best use the available stock based on evidence and clinical advice, and taking into account projections on the revised delivery schedule to maximise protection in the community. “Practices will continue to offer the vaccine to pre-schoolers and children in at risk groups as normal. The school vaccination programme is currently continuing as normal. Pupils at special schools have already received their vaccine. “However, the disruption to supply may lead to vaccinations in some primary schools being rescheduled, but all eligible children will have an opportunity to receive their vaccine. “Whilst this situation is unfortunate, it is completely outside our control and we would continue to urge eligible people to get vaccinated, as we know this is the best way to protect against the flu. Parents of at-risk children and pre-schoolers should make themselves aware of their own GP surgery’s flu vaccination arrangements.” This issue does not impact on the adult flu vaccination programme, and we encourage all adults who are eligible to receive the flu vaccine to get it. This will not only help to protect them, but will also help to reduce the impact of flu in the wider community.

These sides are no strangers to each other and it is a game that features two of the outstanding underage teams in the country over the past few years having clashed with each other in the last two All Ireland Feacuteile finals, Burren winning the  Feile and Magherafelt gaining revenge in the final of the  Feacuteile. Both teams are no strangers to the Paul McGirr tournament either with Burren’s latest visit being last year where they were defeated narrowly in the semi final by Lavey, they have fonder memories of the tournament however from  when they won it with a team from which many of the players have already progressed onto their senior team which won last year’s Down title. googletag.cmd.push This season Burren’s success has continued having blitzed their way through the Down league and championship culminating in a - to - victory over Bredagh in the championship final. With  of their starting team from last year’s Paul McGirr campaign there is no doubt that Burren are the team to beat this year. James Kelly, Patrick McCarthy and Ryan Magill backbone a talented defence, Odhran Murdock and Conlin Bradley will be looking to dominate proceedings in midfield while up front James Duggan, Zach Murdock and Eoin Loughran are all noted score getters. However their talisman Niall Toner is the man the Derry champions will really have to look out for, his displays in the tournament last year were breathtaking to say the least and there is no doubt he will have a major bearing on the contest. Lead coach Neil Coulter feels his preparations have been hindered somewhat but is looking forward to the occasion ‘Burren are delighted to be once again representing Down in this year’s Paul McGirr Ulster Tournament, preparations have been tough going as  of our players were involved with the minor’s in last Sunday’s championship final replay so getting them together this past few weeks hasn’t been easy, however we are really looking forward to Saturday’s game against Magherafelt, it is a repeat of the Feacuteile finals and will be a really tough battle.’ Magherafelt are a club that’s riding on a crest of a wave at the minute with this week being one of the most memorable in the south Derry club’s history, adding the Derry U title to their historic senior victory last weekend. Wednesday evenings - to - victory over a fancied Lavey in wet and windy conditions was met with great euphoria and Enda Qunn’s men will be looking to take that momentum into Saturday’s fixture. They won’t have had much time to recover but they are a side laced with quality, Luke McCann and Eoin McEvoy the fulcrum of a solid defence with McCann likely being given the unenviable task of keeping tabs on Toner. Cormac Bateson and Dan Higgins form a very solid midfield partnership and up front they have their own talisman in Daragh Wade who was part of last season’s Derry minor . This game has the potential to be one of the best in the long history of the Paul McGirr tournament and no doubt both clubs will bring a huge support with them for the fixture. It is an intriguing match up with both sides being used to success and being very familiar with each other. Magherafelt will definitely not be ring rusty but may feel the effects of their draining battle with Lavey on Wednesday night. The hurt of having lost out to Lavey in last years semi final should give Burren that bit of an extra incentive and this could well tip the scales in their favour, either way whoever emerges from the tie will be favourites to annex the  Paul McGirr title.

We must’ve had a least a  minute phone-call with him saying ‘you’re doing nets’ and me saying ‘no’ but sure look where I am at now and I’m happy about it,” the imposing Magherafelt custodian utters with a smile. “I’ll take it.”For the last two weeks, Barry Gillis worked intently with Lynch ahead of the biggest day in the clubs history for  years.He kicked ball through the eye of a needle almost and made himself impassable when an Ethan Doherty goal would’ve opened a four point lead in the first-half.As well as that, his handling was impeccable as stray, wind-assisted balls dropped in on top of him in the second-half.How does a young player deal with pressure “You expect the pressure, that’s what comes from being in nets. If somebody outfield drops the ball, somebody  picks it up. If I drop the ball, it’s a goal. You saw it yourself a few games ago . I have played in a few big games but nothing like this. In the big games, you know what to expect.”At one point in the second-half he took off on a foray into the midfield zone. It’s impossible to clip his wings all the time.“You play with a bit of freedom as well. I get to go on wee runs but they don’t want too many of them. You’re the th man and whenever everyone  is wrecked out the pitch, you are fresh and get to go.”Lynch comes into the senior setup with a contingent of their U winning team and they have fitted like a glove.There is a buzz in the camp and their celebrations, with their tops off, in a local hostelry after their win over Coleraine only galvanised them.“They have been off ever since,” Lynch joked.The togetherness has been fostered by the management team.“It is a great squad to be part of,” he adds. “Cush, Baggio , QBand Tomare very involved.

Sean O’Connor moved on to Armstrong to shut down his threat, while Marty Donaghy’s influence waned after he sustained an arm injury.In contrast, Foreglen only grew in confidence as time ticked on, with Mark McCormick and Kevin O’Connor clinical from the dead ball, while Ciaran McFeely made a huge impact off the bench. googletag.cmd.push BREATHLESSClaudy made two changes to their listed team, with Callum McElhinney in at full-back for Cory Armstrong – tasked with picking up Kevin O’Connor – while Conall White was in for the injured Shane McGahon, acting as the sweeper alongside Stephen Farren and pushing Paddy Hargan into midfield on Mark McCormick alongside Eoin McGahon.Caolaacuten and Cahir O’Connor were the men inside for Foreglen, watched by Fionain Smyth and Jamie Brown respectively, and it allowed Kevin to pull out and create the space with his movement.Conor Johnston squared up to Kevy Dunne, but also acted as the plug in the centre of defence alongside McGahon to stop Oisin Duffy’s runs from deep – with Marty Donaghy pulling out onto the ’ to add his experience.Shea Kerrigan started as the lone man inside, with Cathal O’Hara doing the marking, but Claudy rotated the play – with Aaron Kerrigan and ‘Nugget’ both moving in there at dferent times.With the wind in their favour, the men in blue opened the scoring with two minutes gone, with Marty Donaghy spraying a crossfield pass to younger brother Aaron, and he had time and space inside the ’ to turn inside and chip a right-footed effort over the bar. Aaron Kerrigan doubled the advantage on four minutes with a well-struck free off the ground from the right sideline after Paddy Hargan was fouled.It was the tried and trusted who got Foreglen on the board seconds later when a quick burst of pace through the middle saw Oisin Duffy feed Kevin O’Connor, and he turned away from Callum McElhinney before pointing.A patient O’Brien’s move was ended with a Conal White interception, and it sent the Mitchel’s away. Marty Donaghy took possession on his own ’ and ran all the way into the Foreglen half before palming off the attentions of Eoghan Duffy and sending over a fantastic score – - to -.Pauric Morahan was next to show his pace as he evaded Stephen Farren and Aaron Donaghy down the right before finding Caolan O’Connor, but his attempt from  metres was controversially waved wide.Foreglen were enjoying a period of pressure after a slow start, and they reduced the gap to one on  minutes when a Morahan free was worked into the corner, and Cahir O’Connor turned away from Jamie Brown before fisting over from the angle, with the goal on.Aaron Kerrigan took his tally to two in the th minute when Paddy Hargan recovered after an initial fumble to get the ball through to the forward ahead of McCormick – who wanted the foul in midfield – but Kerrigan advanced on goal and chipped it beautully over the bar while off balance.Oisin Duffy’s runs from deep were being thwarted well early on, but he was stopped illegally by a heavy hit from Stephen Farren on the quarter hour mark. Barry Cassidy played the advantage and Liam O’Hara picked out Kevin O’Connor for the score – - to -.The game was levelled for the first time on  minutes when O’Connor won a soft free off Hargan on the  metre line, and the experienced forward dusted himself down to split the sticks.Claudy regained the lead three minutes later however, when Armstrong took a pass from Marty Donaghy and, despite having his arm pulled, managed to spin around and send one over from  metres off the left – - to -.He followed it up with a free after Eoin McGahon claimed the kick-out and Aaron Donaghy’s initial effort was well blocked down by James O’Kane before Armstrong was fouled, and converted.Another soft free in the Claudy defence after Fionain Smyth had initially won the turnover allowed O’Connor to take his tally to - and make it - to - on the board.Kevin then had the ball in the net after an initial Caolan O’Connor shot came back off the post, but it was ruled out as Cassidy had blown for a free. Mark McCormick slotted it over the top and, once again, it was a level playing field.Foreglen then took the lead for the first time in the final minute of normal time when patient play ended with McCormick fisting over the top for John Duffy in space, and he popped it over from  metres – issuing a cry into the ear of McGahon in celebration.The lead lasted just  seconds though as Hargan was fouled at the other end and the impressive Armstrong was on target with the free from the right.He was the man in form for Claudy, and he grabbed his fourth in added time when he latched on to a brilliant Aaron Kerrigan pass and sent it over off his weaker right foot to give the Mitchel’s the slimmest of leads at the break. Half-time:Claudy -Foreglen -  Pauric Morahan was moved into the half forward line at the start of the second-half on Blaine Carlin, with Sean O’Connor on Oran Armstrong.A pull from Jamie Brown on the shirt of Cahir O’Connor after he beat him for pace down the right allowed Mark McCormick to level things again within two minutes of the restart.The first manic moment came on  minutes when Marty Donaghy rode a heavy hit to feed Aaron, and his shot was batted down by Tiarnan Burke on the line and gathered in by John Duffy to prevent Conall White having an easy finish to the net.The Mitchel’s edged ahead again on  minutes and no surprise it was off the boot of Armstrong who curled a free off the ground and just over the bar, despite the efforts of McCormick on the line – - to -, but Claudy’s last.An Eoghan Duffy score after James O’Kane won the break from a Reilly kick-out came before Hargan struck the outside of the post after a fine Claudy move that started with some excellent skill from substitute Jamie Donaghy.Ciaran McFeely was also enjoying an influence off the bench, and he picked a pass in midfield to Kevin O’Connor who took a high tackle from McElhinney and opened his second-half account from the free after  minutes – - to - to Foreglen.The O’Brien’s stretched their lead to two for the first time in the game with  minutes left, when Caolan O’Connor was hacked down by Hargan but managed to get it away to Kevin for the point.The gap was three on  minutes when Aaron Kerrigan hesitated at one end and sent the ball wide, and from the kick-out Ciaran McFeely won the break and immediately looked for Kevin O’Connor. He found Liam O’Hara off the shoulder who chipped over the bar from ten metres – - to -.Foreglen’s dominance continued heading into added time as Eoghan Duffy found acres of space on the  metre line to stick it over the bar, followed by a super McCormick free from the right sideline.It was the midfielder who got the last score of the final with another free to signal wild celebrations from the green and gold.

Ref: Barry Cassidy .  MAN OF THE MATCHEoghan Duffy – Foreglen were resilient as a team in the first-half, but in the second they came to le – and a lot of it was down to Eoghan Duffy. He was everywhere, first to the ball, powerful on the run, and scored two super points. TURNING POINTChanges – When both teams needed to switch it up and break the cycle, it was Foreglen’s bench that proved the dference. Ciaran McFeely entered the fray after  minutes and took control in midfield to assert the Foreglen dominance. SCORE OF THE GAMEDonaghy point – It was only the one score for Marty Donaghy on the day, but it was typically brilliant. He took the ball inside his own half, ran the guts of  metres and then fired over on the spin, despite being under a lot of pressure.

Foreglen got the first score and once they get a lead, they are hard to peg back.“We will go away and scratch our heads and wonder how it got away from us but it is what it is. At the end of the day, Foreglen is a good side and congratulations to them.”When Oran Armstrong’s free escaped the clutches of Mark McCormick to give Claudy a th minute lead, - to - it proved to be their last score of the game.“We just couldn’t get it over the bar,” McGonigle expressed of how they slipped out of the game and pointed to the injury sustained by captain Marty Donaghy.“If it hadn’t have been Marty Donaghy, he would probably have been taken off. We kept him on thinking, he might get a snf of a goal but it didn’t really click today for us. We didn’t get them ball in well enough and the full-forward line just wasn’t able to get the scores we needed. You need the wee breaks, we didn’t get them today and that’s the way it goes.”McGonigle also gave credit to how Foreglen managed the game.“They suck the le out of you and once they get a lead, they are hard to get the ball off. They keep it tight and are good at killing out games. We knew thatthey got a lead, they’d be hard to claw back.”After winning the league, they will begin  in the top flight.“We will go away and lick our wounds but we’ll be back for senior football and we’ll give it a rattle. At the end of the day, this team is pretty young. Take Marty out of that, there is a really good core of young players there and that’s what we’ll be building on. Hopefully in the first ision, we will be able to give a good account of ourselves.”Speaking to the County Derry Post earlier in the season, former Derry forward Donaghy hinted that this season would be his last in the blue and white.“I can’t see him playing again,” McGonigle feels.  “It is hard for him. He has a lot of knocks and he has been hobbling about for half the season. “I’d say that’s Martynow but hopefully not, we could be doing with him for a few more years yet.We’ll see. Maybe a couple of months away from it is the best thing for him and see how he feels in January or February.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Or perhaps he just couldn’t quite believe what he was seeing.“We were talking about doing it for the parish during a meeting on Saturday and there was a video of near enough everybody in the community wishing us well and wishing everybody good luck – whether it was brothers, sisters, friends, mums, dads, children, everyone was on it,” Duffy told the County Derry Post. “It’s not about us, it’s not about the players, it’s everybody in the community and in the club house we celebrate it together. “Winning championships is great, I love it, but I only love it because it brings everybody together, the whole community, and that’s what it’s all about.” googletag.cmd.push RUB OF THE GREENIn a game that was so nip and tuck in the first half, with Foreglen leading for less than a minute and down a point at the break, Duffy said they believed in their plan all the way, with the underdogs tag only adding incentive.“To be honest I found it a bit bizarre how strong of favourites Claudy were against us. Nobody really gave us a chance,” stated the defender. “Somebody told me that the bookies had us at   and they were odds on favourites, but nobody in our changing room would have had them as that. “We knew the depth of our squad, the players that we had to come in there, and the competition for places. We knew it was going to be a tight game, we knew it was going to be  , but maybe that added a wee bit of incentive – the fact that nobody gave us a chance.”He continued: “We got in there at half-time and we knew there was a big wind and thatwe held our shape as best we could in the second half then we would be hard to live with, and it worked out that way. “We just set up really well at the back and then had the  to break forward. I saw halfway through the second half as well that Marty Donaghy was holding his arm, so it was probably a big loss to Claudy offensively when he wasn’t firing on all cylinders with the injury. “Again, you get the rub of the green some days. Big Mark McCormick hit two wonder scores from the sideline and whenever those go over you know it’s going to be your day, so we’re delighted.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Co-written withRTEacutebroadcasterJoe DuffyChildrenof the Troubles tells the story of  children aged  and under who died in the conflict between  and .Based on original interviews with almost  families, as well as extensive archival research it has an account about each victim and how they died.Mr Duffy had the idea for Children of the Troubles when he was working on his  book Children of the Rising and on hearing aboutFreya, who is Northern corespondent for the , asked her to get on board.It was a much bigger project than I think either of us realised, she admittedThere was so much research and so many interviews in the last year in particular.The pair painstakingly scoured newspapers and contacted victim supportgroups to help compile the book.You do wonder of there are any children we havent heard of, said MsMcClements.There may well be others whose deaths werent made public.That is why we did a lot of public appeals too through newspapers like the Derry News, asking families to come forward.Tragically, some of the children in the book have no surviving relatives.We have children in the book and there are some families that we werent bale to get in contact with.Some didnt have any survivingfamily and it was really sad as no one was able to speak on their behalf.There were also some families who didnt wish to speak, but they all wished us well with the book.For some of the families it was the first time they had spoken publicly about their loved one.We were very mindful that we were asking people about probably the worst thing that could ever happen to someone, continuedFreya.It was still very painful for them to revisit it.People said that we would be bringing things up for the families, but they said that was completely untrue because this is something they think about every single day.As a journalist I would always say its not about me, its about the families but you wouldnt be humanyou werent affected.There was one mother in particular, who I wont name, and we were just hugging each other.Joe andFreyaset out to show people who these children were.We very deliberately always started with something about the child, she explained.Sometimes there is a tendency in journalism to talk about the incident rather than the inidual.So we talked about the boy who wanted to be a priest or who loved playing outside.We made it something about them.You feel you get to know the children as people.What they liked to do, what they wanted to be when they grew up.The resulting book pays tribute to these young lives andFreyasays she is proud of what they have achieved.As a journalist I write a lot of things and then they are in tomorrows paper and then they are gone.But this feels a lot more permanent.All those children should still have been alive today and I would like to think people will come away with a sense of that.Even bringing the families togetherfor the launch felt signicant.The publication of the book has also led to talk of a permanent memorial for child victims of the Troubles.I would be led by the families in that, saidFreya.If it was something they thought they would like to see then I would be delighted for them.One of the things that Joe and I felt was remarkable was that there wasnt even a complete list of all the children that had died, and now they are talking about remembering them and I think that is very signicant.Its fantastic that conversation has got going. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last season Academy vied with Limavady and Clogher Valley for top spot in the league all year so Limavady expected a dficult encounter.Limavady got off to a bright start which resulted in Ben Riley scoring from a fine inidual effort when he broke clear from the half way line to touch down under the posts Luke Faulkner converted. For most of the first half the game was tightly fought until the th minute when Stewart Roddy ran in a score following good work from Luke Montgomery. Luke Faulkner again converted. Just before half time Limavady scored two further tries which effectively killed the game off. Following a good break from Peter Wilson at scrum half Ben Riley was on his shoulder to take the try scoring pass. The bonus point try came when captain Jody McMurray spotted that the home defence had gone to sleep when he coolly strolled in under the posts. Luke again converted to take the half time score to . in Limavady’s favour.The second half continued in much the same vein. Limavady scored first when Peter Wilson broke from the ten metre line to outpace the home defence and score in the corner. Luke Faulkner, in excellent form with the boot this year, once again stepped up with the conversion.Academy managed to hit back with a try of their own, however it was only a matter of time until Limavady would score again. Gavin Martin, now playing in the out half position, managed to make a break and fed Stewart Roddy for his second try of the game. Try number seven came as a result of a long clearance kick from Luke Faulkner which was brilliantly chased down by Stewart Roddy. Putting pressure on Academy’s last line of defence Roddy managed to secure ball and fed inside to Stuart Morrow following up in support. Jody McMurray converted.The only other score was a late consolation effort by Academy when they again crossed in the corner.To top off an excellent day Limavady nds also won convincingly . with tries from Jason Kerr , JamieMillar , Aaron Reilly , John Purcell, Jack Elliott, and Harry McAleese. Harry converted nine of these ten tries.No fixtures for either side next week. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Following a good break from Peter Wilson at scrum half Ben Riley was on his shoulder to take the try scoring pass. The bonus point try came when captain Jody McMurray spotted that the home defence had gone to sleep when he coolly strolled in under the posts. Luke again converted to take the half time score to . in Limavady’s favour.The second half continued in much the same vein. Limavady scored first when Peter Wilson broke from the ten metre line to outpace the home defence and score in the corner. Luke Faulkner, in excellent form with the boot this year, once again stepped up with the conversion.Academy managed to hit back with a try of their own, however it was only a matter of time until Limavady would score again. Gavin Martin, now playing in the out half position, managed to make a break and fed Stewart Roddy for his second try of the game. Try number seven came as a result of a long clearance kick from Luke Faulkner which was brilliantly chased down by Stewart Roddy. Putting pressure on Academy’s last line of defence Roddy managed to secure ball and fed inside to Stuart Morrow following up in support. Jody McMurray converted.The only other score was a late consolation effort by Academy when they again crossed in the corner.To top off an excellent day Limavady nds also won convincingly . with tries from Jason Kerr , JamieMillar , Aaron Reilly , John Purcell, Jack Elliott, and Harry McAleese. Harry converted nine of these ten tries.No fixtures for either side next week. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sean Bell started the ball rolling for the Downpatrick side with a great opening point. However, Bryansfordrsquos sharpshooter Danny Savage, who was to score a spectacular - for his side, levelled the scoring.The RGU then played some scintillating football to take a - to - lead with points from Gerdy Collins , Connor McCarron and Johnnie Bell, who was having a superb game at midfield.Damian Turley, Collins and Tom Smyth were dominating the game and it was dficult to see how Bryansford were going to compete with them.But Savage, a former Down player, kept the lsquoFord in touch with four unanswered points to bring his side within one of the visitors.Another former county player, Packie Downey, was coming more into the game and he levelled the scores with a stunning point from play.Downpatrickrsquos Conor McGrady, another to wear the famous red and black colours, was brought into the game when defender Damian Branf was black carded, putting the RGU in front with a point.Smyth put the Hoops two in front, but the RGU were left stunned when Chris Clarke ended the half with an explosive shot that beat Deeny in the RGU goal to give Bryansford the half-time lead.If the RGU was stunned going into the break, after dominating for long periods in the first half, then after the opening  minutes of the second period, the thought of relegation to Division  was beginning to look a real possibility.Savage scored with with two frees, a  and a rsquo, but then the lsquoFord sharpshooter, with a real opportunist goal, put his side unbelievably six in front.Tim Prenter was then introduced into the game in place of McCarron and with the RGU management urging their players on, they duly responded with points from Branaganand a brace from Conor Doherty to put only one in the game.Conail McNabb was brought on in place of Ruari Quinn and unfortunately only lasted five minutes with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Tommy Loudon.However, with time ticking away, Savage again was the thorn in the RGU side with a  yard free to extend the lead to two.Damian Turley, with a breathtaking score, put the Hoops tantalising only one behind, but Davy McKibben, with a  yard free, put the lsquoFord two ahead again.Try as they could, the Hoops could not mount one last challenge and they were doomed to Division  for next year.Bryansford: M Reid, J Harbinson, S Toner, A Ward, D McDonald, T McAreavey, N OrsquoHiggins, P Downey , D McKibben , C Maginn, K Kavanagh, T Hanna, R OrsquoHiggins, C Clark , D Savage .Downpatrick: J Deeny, P Smyth, D Branf, E Rooney, R Murphy, S Bell , T Smyth , J Bell , D Turley , C McCarron , G Collins , C Doherty , J Branagan , P Turley, R Quinn.

We aim to meet these demands by providing a first-class experience in every aspect of their visit.Ardglass captain, Macartan Bryce, said the club is ldquohonoured to have received the award.He added: ldquoArdglass Golf Club is often praised on social media for the friendliness of its welcome and I believe this is down to not only the staff, but to the friendly reception that visitors receive from our members.Local councillor, Dermot Curran, has extended his congratulations to club officials in charge of the course in his home village.ldquoArdglass Golf Club is widely regarded as one of the best in Ireland and consistently attracts golfers from across the globe, he said.ldquoIt plays a key role in helping boost the local economy and I hope that additional visitor accommodation can been provided locally..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Baroness.jpg","title":"Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick ready to embrace House of Lords  ","story":"FORMER South Down MP Margaret Ritchie will formally take her place in the House of Lords on November .Several weeks ago she was appointed as a Member of the House, something that she regards as a ldquotremendous opportunity for her to re-engage with mainstream politics at a critical time.Her new title will be Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick, with the former MP explaining that she has chosen her title as it reflects the area where she was born, baptised, educated and spent most of her working le.Elected as a member of the former Down Council in , Miss Ritchie went on to become an MLA, Stormont Social Development Minister, SDLP leader and MP.Her appointment to the House of Lord opens a new chapter for her, one that she plans to embrace on behalf of all of the people of Northern Ireland.Baroness Ritchie firmly believes that where political chambers exist, people should be members of them to reflect the needs of communities across Northern Ireland.

It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South. Sadly these have been down for nearly three years, she said.The Baroness added: ldquoMy appointment to the House of Lords is an evolution. I was elected to Down Council in , was the organisationrsquos first female chairman, worked as MP Eddie McGradyrsquos parliamentary secretary, became an MLA and MP for South Down and a Minister in the Stormont administration.ldquoIt is now the House of Lords which represents a new challenge and an opportunity which I fully intend to grasp and embrace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Bid.jpg","title":"Bid for community centre in Crossgar  ","story":"A CALL has been made for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to keep the pressure on the Department for Communities to fund a new community centre in Crossgar.The village will be left without a building used to host a number community events when the Downpatrick Street property is sold.

Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area. The le of a Murlough AC member is indeed a good one and already planning has begun for the next Major.Meanwhile, the week before, Kieran McShane made the long trek to Australia to complete in the Melbourne Marathon.The race began with an early am start along Batman Avenue in the glorious sunshine. This was Kieranrsquos first big run in over three months due to injuries, so took him a lot longer to finish, but he says it just meant he had more time to take in the lovely views of Melbourne.It was an amazing race from start to finish taking in all the iconic places around Melbourne such as St Paulrsquos Cathedral, Flinders Street, Botanic Gardens and the Shrine of Remembrance.Followed by a lap around the GP circuit then up and down St Kildarsquos beach along the promenade. The finish line was held inside the Melbourne Cricket Ground where the runners had to complete a lap inside the stadium in front of the roaring crowd as they crossed the line in an amazing atmosphere..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Relive.jpg","title":"Relive the glory days as Down swept all before them to lift Sam Maguire  ","story":"THE countdown is on for a night of nostalgia with the Down  All-Ireland legends when they descend on Loughinisland GAC this Saturday where they will look back at their historic journey which is part of sporting folklore.However, the night will be tinged with sadness after the sudden passing of the former Down and Bryansford star Eamonn Burns, , who won two All-Ireland titles in  and rsquo and managed the county for a three-year spell which ended when he stepped down last year.During that tenure he led his Down team to the  Ulster SFC final with wins over neighbours Armagh and Monaghan.The highlight of Eamonnrsquos career, undoubtedly, was his two points which helped edge out Meath in , including a point which put the Mourne side into a lead they would not relinquish, finishing with a - to - victory.There will be a special tribute on the night to show Eamonnrsquos valuable contribution to Downrsquos glory years.The celebration is to mark the th anniversary of the sidersquos historic win over Dublin in Croke Park during a poignant year for those in the village and surrounding areas.A large contingent of the  Down squad will be in attendance, including captain DJ Kane, lsquoMayobridge Flyerrsquo Mickey Linden, James McCartan, Ross Carr, Downpatrick pair Conor Deegan and Barry Breen, Castlewellanrsquos Gregory McCartan and Ciaran McCabe, Bryansfordrsquos Brian Burns, Carryduff goalkeeper Neil Collins, and, of course, Loughinislandrsquos Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, plus many more.Compere for the night will be TV and radio personality Frank Mitchell.

Whilst Gerard Colgan was playing for An Riocht in , he spent the last of his playing days with Loughinisland. Both players are now passing on their valuable knowledge to the future generations through coaching our underage teams.ldquoThe club is very grateful that so many legends of the  team are ing to spend this evening with us. This will be a relaxed evening where we can sit back and listen to the enthralling stories from those glory days.ldquoTo honour this fantastic achievement, Loughinisland are delighted to host the Down legends from  in a special evening in our clubrooms.ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. Twenty five years on from the massacre we will reflect on the impact of this Down victory for the community, and the uplt that the team brought.ldquoNot only did the team bring the Anglo-Celt cup, they also came and played at our pitch against a combined Loughinisland, Teconnaught and Drumaness select side, representing all three parishes most impacted. The footballing spirit of the GAA helped the community through these darkest days.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the iconic silverware.The event will be sponsored by The Irish News and the organising committee would like to thank them for their support and backing.Tickets priced at pound can be purchased in OrsquoToolersquos bar, Loughinisland GAC clubrooms, or by contacting the clubrsquos Facebook page, email loughinislandgac@gmail, or calling  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Saintfield.jpg","title":"Saintfield out of luck in Intermediate Cup  ","story":"SAINTFIELD United travelled to Seagoe in the first round of the Intermediate Cup on Saturday, but were beaten in a penalty shoot-out.Breezy conditions and a heavy pitch meant that playing attractive, free flowing football would be dficult for both sides.Despite the conditions, Saintfield started quickly, putting the hosts under pressure early on and forcing a few saves from the Seagoe lsquokeeper.But it was the hosts who took the lead with their first attack of the game when the attacker was the first to react to a parried save from Harper to tap home.Saintfield looked to get back on level terms and when James Sofley latched onto a short pass back to the lsquokeeper, he was dragged down unceremoniously and the defender was rightfully shown a straight red card.Saints continued to push and drew level when a familiar corner routine from Ryan Sofley allowed Andy Clarke to smash his ninth goal of the season into the top corner.Soonafter they took the lead when Nick Ross found James Sofley on the edge of the box, and he tucked it into the bottom corner and that completed the scoring in the first half.The second half went back and forth, Saintfield perhaps opting to try the killer pass rather than retaining possession and tiring their depleted opponents and were almost punished when a slip at the back allowed Seagoe a one-on-one with Harper.The attacker beat the lsquokeeper, but couldnrsquot beat Nick Ross who cleared it off the line. But this reprieve was short-lived as the same man got in behind again, but this time finishing well to bring the scores level.Both teams had openings, where a better pass or better cross could have led to a winner, but the game went to extra-time at -.The heavy ground seemed to have taken its toll on both teams as an uneventful  minutes meant the game went to penalties.The hosts scored their first three spot kicks and Saintfield missed their second and third.The Saints scored their fourth and Harper made a save to give the visitors some hope, but the Saints hit the bar with their final penalty to go out of the cup at the first hurdle.Seagoe FC Saintfield United INTERMEDIATE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Saul.jpg","title":"Saul pre school praised in inspection report  ","story":"SAUL community pre-school playgroup is celebrating after receiving an encouraging inspection report from the Education and Training Inspectorate.The St Patrickrsquos Road playgroup received the second highest rating of good for quality of learning provision, leadership and management and outcomes for children.Playgroup leader, Delia McLaughlin, took over in September last year only to learn that the school was to have an inspection at the end of her first six months.She explained that staff joined with her working tirelessly over the months, often staying late at night to prepare for the inspection.ldquoWe also had support from our Early Years advisor Megan McConaghy and management committee,Delia explained. ldquoWe are all delighted to have received the second highest rating and are committed to maintaining this standard of the years to come.Accredited by Early Years, the Organisation for Young Children, the playgroup aims to provide quality pre-school care to children aged from two years and  months to four years.Mrs McLoughlin leads a team of play assistants mdash Rita Magorrian, Maureen Fitzsimons, Pauline Carlin and volunteer Niamh Kearney mdash to look after the  children who attend the morning an afternoon sessions.The inspectors noted that the playgrouprsquos provision for The World Around Us and early mathematical experiences were ldquoparticular strengths.The report also noted: ldquoThe quality of interactions between staff and the children is very good.

I mean, yes, everybody does know what Boris Johnson is like, we have to respect the fact that the man is the prime minister of the United Kingdom, we are put in a position where we can try and influence what he does and what his government does.“We’re using that influence.

Letter to the editorAs Ben Lowry asserted in his column ‘Middle England chose Brexit over NI fully in UK,’ October , Boris Johnson’s loyalty is first and foremost to the Conservative party and its English electorate. It was always going to be the case and therein lies the harsh lesson for unionism to learn . It is imperative that unionists consolidate and ensure that maintaining the Union remains in our own hands. That is the battle line drawn for the next election when unionists bite the bullet andthe maximum number of MPs possible to hold firm for the unionist cause .We have been here before with shyster prime ministers and survived. This time we now know in advance where we all stand in terms of having our unionism undermined. What unionism requires are cool heads, sharp minds and positive leadership as never before . Solidarity tied into a unity of defence and purpose in upholding the integrity of the Union and reasserting our right to self determination is the number one unionist priority.David McNarry, Comber©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Carrickrsquos Gin Palace inSessions finalA cracking young band with a strong Carrickfergus influence are aiming to be Northern Ireland#s newest music sensation.

He made clear that his party will not stand aside for the DUP in any constituency.In an interview with the News Letter yesterday, Mr Aiken also set out a series of areas in which he will change the party, but stressed that he would not do away with the party’s conscience votes for members in areas such as abortion.The former commander of a Royal Navy nuclear submarine said that he wanted “to get the Ulster Unionist Party to a position where it can represent...solid British values”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button He said that st century liberal Britain is “a very attractive place to be” and that is one of the reasons why so many people from the island of Ireland who go to Britain for university like it and stay.The Ballyclare man said: “That in many ways is quite absent in Northern Ireland at the moment amongst a particular grouping actually what we need to do in Northern Ireland is get that sense of Manchester, Liverpool, whatever it is, and use that to secure the Union”.However, he was scathing about the DUP, particularly in relation to its record at Stormont and the mess of the Brexit negotiations.Two years ago, the UUP insisted that it had not entered a formal pact with the DUP but made what it described as a “unilateral decision” not to stand in North Belfast and instead backed the DUP.\u2028The DUP indid not stand in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, backing the UUP.In the General Election before that, in , the party was open about the fact that it had struck a deal with the DUP not to challenge each other in certain seats.However, when askedthe UUP would stand aside for the DUP in some seats, Mr Aiken bluntly and emphatically told this newspaper: “No. We’re not standing aside. We’re going to fight all  constituencies.”Askedhe would regret his decision to run  candidatesit was to cost someone like Nigel Dodds his seat, Mr Aiken said: “Nigel Dodds and the DUP made it very clear, time and time again, that they don’t need Ulster Unionist support and we didn’t put a border down the Irish Sea Nigel Dodds needs to answer that question.”\u2028Mr Dodds, the DUP’s Westminster leader and one of its most capable figures, is its most electorally vulnerable MP.In , even with the UUP standing aside, Sinn Fein was just , votes behind the DUP deputy leader.The last time when the UUP stood in the constituency was two years ago when in the Assembly election Robert Foster, a low-profile candidate, polled , votes.Arlene Foster: Leo Varadkar set a precedent for loyalists with talk of violence Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"However, since then the UUP’s vote has fallen across Northern Ireland and Westminster elections traditionally invovle tactical voting for one of the candidates who is capable of winning, so the UUP’s vote would likely be much lower than that in the forthcoming election.\u2028The Sinn Fein candidate, John Finucane, is Belfast’s Lord Mayor and has signicantly raised his profile since last standing against Mr Dodds.Mr Aiken is still new to politics, having first been elected to any political post when he entered the Assembly as an MLA just three-and-a-half years ago. The South Antrim MLA’s decision not to pursue even a limited pact will not be welcomed by some UUP members and supporters but indicates that he is prepared to take risks in attempting to turn around what has appeared to be the unending decline of the UUP over the last two decades.The UUP supported Remain in the EU referendum – although its members were ided –but then adopted the stance that it accepted the will of voters to leave the EU and the result must be implemented.Mr Aiken, however, said that the way in which the UK chooses to leave must not involve any fresh checks in the Irish Sea or at the Irish border, which “in effect means something much closer to the Customs Union”.He said that at present Brexiteers in Northern Ireland faced a poor choice – either a deal which is not really Brexit for Northern Ireland, or keeping the UK together at the expense of their desire for the whole UK to leave the EU.Referring to the DUP’s recent U-turn to back a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, Mr Aiken said: “I cannot understand for the le of me – and I know we joke about ‘jot and tittle’ and Arlene and [DUP chief executive] Timmy Johnston not being all over the detail – but how did we ever get in a situation where the DUP, the supposed supporters of the Union, have been one of the biggest detractors from it and through the agreement to put a border down the Irish Sea have created a place apart  That is extraordinary.”Mr Aiken, who made clear that he was pragmatically in favour of the EU rather than being enthusiastic about Brussels, said that the UUP needed to provide an alternative because “at the momentyou are voting unionist...the only thing you’re in essence supporting is Brexit”Mr Aiken said that the UUP would either back a form of Brexit which did not damage the Union, or,that is not possible, then remaining in the EU in order to preserve the Union.try catch  TrendingLATEST | Police arrest second N.I. manin connection with  dead people discovered in lorry container in connection with  dead people discovered in lorry container\"Essex lorry deaths: PSNI search two NI addresses after  bodies foundNI braces itself for storm battering and theres a big chill on the way tooDavid McNarry: PM disgracefully humiliated Dodds.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections. We must resist Tory attempts to close down our democracy. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in .

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year.
