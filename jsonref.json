And, you know, microplastics are a real problem, especially the microplastics from fast-fashion. Did you know that\u0027s one of the biggest culprits?\u0027Bonnie Sheppard, 15, another Albert Park College student, said: \u0027Meghan was really interested in the effect of microplastics. I told her that there are more microplastics in the ocean than stars in the Milky Way, which she was surprised by.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s amazing what you guys are doing,\u0027 said Meghan. \u0027Well done, you\u0027re doing a really great job.

She\u0027s acting great at the moment,\u0027 Morgan said, adding that it was a \u0027red light when people behave like that, in an odd manner\u0027.Stefanovic hit back at Morgan during Thursday morning\u0027s Today show, saying his comments were \u0027disgraceful\u0027.\u0027I think she is an amazing, amazing woman and I think she\u0027s doing her very best at the moment, and she\u0027s got a lot on her plate and is doing it so beautifully,\u0027 Stefanovic said.\u0027She\u0027s such a great export for Great Britain, I mean - what is that guy on?\u0027Morgan replied to Stefanovic\u0027s outburst on Twitter, telling the Channel Nine presenter to \u0027pipe down\u0027.                                                    Carlo Foster, 12, an Albert Park Primary pupil, showed Harry and Meghan bags full of plastic cups, beakers and bottles he has collected. Harry said: \u0027Another worrying thing I\u0027m hearing is some people trying to claim things like these are actually habitats for fish and turtles. Don\u0027t ever let anyone convince you of that.\u0027The couple also spoke to Melisand Box, 14, from Albert Park College, who had a bag filled with plastic straws. She said: \u0027Harry told us to spread the message about whether people really need to use straws at all, and if they do, to use bamboo or metal straws.\u0027Harry and Meghan then did a \u0027mini-walkabout\u0027, greeting dozens of excited schoolchildren who had lined up on the beach to meet them. Among them was Amelia Marcom, 12, from St Kilda Primary school: \u0027I gave Meghan flowers, a picture of her and Harry I\u0027d drawn for them and some t-shirts for the baby. She said she loved them.\u0027Before leaving the beach, the couple strolled hand in hand down to the shoreline, to meet a group of lifeguards from Australia Surf Lifeguards. Sebastian Top, 20, a lifeguard for more than four years, asked Meghan, \u0027Are you going to swim today?\u0027 \u0027Maybe not today,\u0027 she laughed. Harry pointed to a group of around 30 people who had waded into the sea from the beach to get a better view of them: \u0027If we try and swim, I think they might be a bit of a hazard.\u0027 Showing they\u0027re not afraid to get their hands dirty, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will help local schoolchildren pick up litter from South Melbourne beach.Changing into a pair of  Rothy\u0027s flats and a matching black Miguellina Dress, Meghan and her husband made their way onto Melbourne\u0027s iconic mode of transport, along with student leaders at a local school. Arriving at the beach, the couple were fortunate to be greeted not only by roaring crowds, but also a bit of sunshine. Earlier, despite the royal couple arriving 20 minutes late for their first engagement of the day, the crowd of around 5,000 showed no sign of dampening their enthusiasm, gripped by \u0027Meg-Mania\u0027.           Harry and Meghan wave to the well-wishers after taking a ride on a tram in Melbourne          On the way to the beach Meghan smiled and showed Harry a little stuffed toy as the rode the tram in Melbourne          The couple took Melbourne\u0027s iconic tram system to the beach, catching it with student leaders at a local school          After lunch, the Duke and Duchess made a quick wardrobe change, the latter changing from heels to flats          Prince Harry also changed from the navy suit which originally matched his wife\u0027s outfit into a grey jacket and black trousers          The couple were also treated to lunch at Fitzroy\u0027s Charcoal Lane, which offers Aboriginal youths employment          Crushing a leaf of Strawberry Gum, a type of eucalyptus, the chef encouraged the royal visitors to smell it. \u0027Is that what Koalas eat in the Bush?\u0027 asked the Duke.          Among other plants, Harry bites into some eucalyptus, but not before he had to ask: \u0027Isn\u0027t that what koalas eat?\u0027    Executive Chef Greg Hampton (right) told the royal couple how they provide opportunity to young Aboriginal people  Harry tried plants and was also served Kangaroo and barracuda as a series of Aussie delicacies were prepared and Meghan had a good sniff of some ingredients          The couple departed Government House, visiting an Aboriginal artwork mural on Fitzroy restaurant Charcoal Lane    Prince Harry has cheekily mocked a young girl (pictured) who put a hand on her hips and refused to take a photograph with the royalPrince Harry has cheekily mocked a camera-shy young girl who refused to pose for a photograph with the visiting royal.While thousands of fans have clamoured for a piece of the Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle, this toddler in Dubbo had other ideas.She placed her left hand on her hip and stubbornly refused to move forward and say hello to a bemused prince.He in turn placed his hands on his hips to playfully mimic the young girl before bending down to give her a hug.The girl\u0027s parents were heard in the background giggling at their daughter\u0027s behaviour during the meet-and-greet in Dubbo on Wednesday before pushing her slightly forward to chat to the prince.                                                     But Meghan and Harry appeared completely at ease as they took a tram to the beach with a group of excited schoolchildren.While the journey lasted less than five minutes, the youngsters managed to get in some pressing questions. Ella Burns, a 12-year-old pupil from Albert Park primary school added: \u0027She said that she hadn\u0027t thought of one as it was still quite early.\u0027Meghan was also asked by Ella what she liked doing in her spare time.The Duchess replied that she \u0027didn\u0027t have much spare time\u0027 but when she does, she enjoys \u0027relaxing and watching TV shows.\u0027She faltered when asked what her favourite show was, and replied: \u0027There\u0027s heaps, I can\u0027t think of a specific one.\u0027 Meanwhile Lola Marinis, 12, from Middlepark Primary School, sat near Harry.He asked what job she wanted to do, and she replied that she wanted to be a teacher.Harry told her, \u0027There is always going to be one bad teacher that you remember, we need more good teachers.\u0027The Duchess of Sussex has been given plenty of flowers since she arrived in Australia. But today she was given her first tiara.It was presented by six year old Annie, a pupil at Albert Park primary school in Melbourne.Annie was one of 600 cheering children who greeted the duke and duchess as they came to see how the school is cutting waste and growing vegetables as part of a sustainability programme.Harry spotted Annie, who was holding a bunch of flowers as well as a toy tiara, and knelt down and said: \u0027Lily of the valley - is that right?\u0027Then, gesturing to Meghan, he said: \u0027Are they for her?\u0027The duchess, who was wearing a dress by Club Monaco, came over and said: \u0027Oh my goodness, thank you.

She enjoyed being around women who want to make a change.\u0027She described her as a \u0027role model\u0027 and added: \u0027She was really engaged. She has done a lot of work in the background with women\u0027s empowerment and it was good to see her coming along and seeing people in local communities making a change.\u0027After walking around the presentation, the couple - who had spit up to view different areas of the display - reunited to walk inside Government House to meet young people involved in a number of innovative and entrepreneurial programmes developed by young people in the Victoria region.First up was the Man Cave - a preventative mental health program for teenage boys, which was founded by Queens Young Leader Hunter Johnson.\u0027There\u0027s a familiar face,\u0027 Meghan said as she reached out to shake the CEO\u0027s hand. Harry also made a beeline to greet Johnson, who quickly thanked the Duke for his support.The conversation quickly turned to Harry\u0027s speech in Dubbo on Wednesday, where he delivered an emotional message to Australian farmers and opened up about depression and mental health issues.\u0027So many young much are suffering from these problems without even realising,\u0027 Harry remarked.Also representing Man Cave was 14-year-old Rupert Grant, a student from Melbourne Grammar School who had been involved with the programme through his school after experiencing a \u0027tough time\u0027 in school. After explaining how the programme had made an impact on life for him and his friends, Meghan remarked, \u0027You\u0027re quite the spokesman!\u0027          Prince Harry and Meghan started model Formula 1 cars at demonstration held at Government House in Melbourne          Harry and Meghan have now arrived at Government House, where they were greeted by Victorian Governor Linda Dessau\u0027We really need more global leaders like Harry,\u0027 Johnson later shared. \u0027There is a change happening among men now, a focus on healthy masculinity and having his support is a real badge of honour.\u0027I thanked Harry for his role modelling and leadership - and we spoke about his incredible words in Dubbo. When I said that the Duchess looked up him proudly.\u0027It\u0027s important that as men we address these issues, that we\u0027re not afraid to take the mask off and open up. To have started that conversation in Dubbo yesterday was powerful.\u0027He\u0027s a positive, glass half-full person and has an incredible influence on the younger generation. He is the right role model for young men and boys today.\u0027After meeting the team from Man Cave, the Duke and Duchess moved on to learn more about Aubot, a robot that can help hospitalised children continue to attend school and the disabled attend work.\u0027This is amazing,\u0027 Meghan commented as she waved a hand in front of one of the robots named after its founder and CEO Marita Chang.Harry seemed particularly interested in their next presentation - a vertical, edible \u0027farm\u0027 designed to grow inside Melbourne cafes, restaurants and, one day, people\u0027s homes. \u0027It will be interesting to see one day how this challenges the supermarkets if people are growing these in their homes,\u0027 Prince Harry said of Farmwall, which was co-founded by Melbourne-based Geert Hendrix.\u0027But I hope that these can be produced with farmers in mind too, so they can exist side by side.\u0027Added Meghan, \u0027I like that there is a focus on nutrients. I can see you have the sprouts, the micro greens... It\u0027s very clever.\u0027          Thousands of royal fans gathered at the Royal Botanic Gardens to take photos and meet the royal couple as they arrive          Recently announced pregnant, Meghan removed her coat as the couple approached the steps of Government HouseThe couple\u0027s final presentation was by the team of Trinity Grammar School, who were part of the Formula 1 in Schools programme - an international STEM competition for schools in which students design and manufacture a miniature car out of an official F1 Model Block.Upon seeing the miniature F1 drag strip the students had built on the State Dining Room table, Harry joked, \u0027We should put one in Buckingham Palace.\u0027They were then offered to launch the two F1 race car models, however neither were expecting the loud air release from the hydraulics that launched the cars. \u0027I wasn\u0027t expecting that!\u0027 exclaimed Meghan, who jumped at the loud noise. Harry laughed.Following the innovation program displays, the Duke and Duchess were escorted by the Governor and her husband to the main reception in the Government House Ballroom, where approximately 350 young people representing the future of Victoria were gathered. The guests were from a broad range of backgrounds, including students, military personnel, entrepreneurs, charity volunteers and farmers.\u0027You are the future of our state - brilliant, innovative and inspiring,\u0027 Governor Dessau said in a welcome speech before the royal couple split up to socialise with the guests who had been grouped together.One of the first Meghan got to meet was Willow the golden Labrador, who was representing Guide Dogs Victoria. \u0027Ahh, everyone knows my achilles heel is dogs,\u0027 she cooed, before kneeling down to pet the \u0027ambassadog\u0027.

The Duchess is a big role model to many.\u0027Harry, who had been working the opposite side of the room - meeting military personnel and volunteers at the Victoria Police force amongst many others - rejoined his wife to move to the final part of their visit in a formal reception space at Government House.

Among others, Meghan spoke to fellow expectant mother Charlotte, who is pictured with her two-year-old son Finn          Meghan shared with a group of yoga performers she does yoga to stay grounded, while Harry prefers to talk openly          Harry revealed her prefers informal chats about mental illness, hoping to reduce the stigma around them          The  couple met with members of a local surfing community called One Wave, which aims to raise awareness for mental health          The community group One Wave aims to raise awareness of mental health and wellbeing, saying it\u0027s a strength to ask for helpThe couple spent around ten minutes listening to the experiences of other members of the group and sharing their own, laughing and putting their arms around each other.Jessina Oakes, 26, of Bondi, said she spoke mainly to the Duchess.\u0027She mentioned that she practises yoga,\u0027 she said.\u0027She said it helps ground her and she tries to find the time to make it part of her daily routine.\u0027Oakes also spoke to Meghan about the dangers of social media, particularly its effect on young people\u0027s self image.\u0027She said a really beautiful quote. She said flattery and criticism run through the same filter.\u0027She said it was very freeing that she no longer has social media.\u0027And just how great One Wave is making those connections with people and being able to support one another.\u0027     The couple spent around ten minutes listening to the experiences of other members of the group and sharing their own           Meghan told them yoga helps ground her and that she tries to find the time to make it part of her daily routine          One Wave founder Grant Trebilco said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health will help people across the globeTrebilco, 37, of Bondi, said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health would help people around the world.\u0027To have the Duke and Duchess down at Fluro Friday helped make mental health visible around the world,\u0027 he said.\u0027And it let people know that mental health doesn\u0027t descriminate.\u0027One thing that really stood out for me was that Prince Harry said asking for help is not a sign of weakness.\u0027It\u0027s a sign of strength.\u0027Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health\u0027It reduces that barrier.\u0027Those bright colours show we can make it visible and we don\u0027t have to go through it alone.\u0027    The couple donned floral leis as they met surfing and yoga members of the community          Members of the sharing group said the royal couple were relatable, open and honestDabriella Quayle, 37, said afterwards: ‘Oh my goodness, they were just so real, so relatable. They shared their own experiences, which was amazing.\u0027Harry said seeking help was the best thing he had ever done. He was really open and honest. He said it doesn\u0027t matter who you open up to, they don\u0027t have to be professional. Anyone can be there for you. It could be your best mate or a stranger. You just need to open up to them.\u0027She added: \u0027They talked about the strangeness of their own situation and the lives they lead but that at the end of the day they are just real people. They are just human beings.\u0027They said they were just like us in that people say lots of positive things to you and then they say one negative thing, and that\u0027s what gets you down.\u0027Meghan said how she did yoga at 4.30 this morning because of the jet lag. She says she is feeling OK, not too bad. They said they hadn\u0027t really had time to settle down and get their heads round thing, and they have another 70 odd engagements to go.\u0027          One member of One Wave said Meghan had a \u0027double whammy\u0027 of jet lag due to her pregnancy          Meghan revealed she had been up at 4.30am that morning practicing yoga when she couldn\u0027t get back to sleep           Meghan said yoga was her \u0027leveller\u0027, with the couple still having another 70 odd engagements to goAfter the circle the royals walked over to a group practising yoga. Nio Poniatowski, 25, said: \u0027Meghan said it was her leveller, it\u0027s what keeps her grounded, like surfing does for us. She said it was her escape.\u0027Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go.Surf instructor Sam Schumacher, 31, said the couple both revealed they had surfed, adding: \u0027The circle time was great. Two or three of us shared our personal stories.\u0027This visit will really raise the profile of what we are trying to do and the fact that mental health doesn\u0027t discriminate. \u0027It can affect anyone and that we all need to try and look after each other. \u0027I can see the passion in their eyes.\u0027Trebilco said the couple had been \u0027so nice, so friendly\u0027.

She said flattery and criticism run through the same filter.\u0027She said it was very freeing that she no longer has social media.\u0027And just how great One Wave is making those connections with people and being able to support one another.\u0027Harry and Meghan¿s great Aussie day out!

Harry said asking for help was not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength. We need to talk about this stuff.

Harry talked about how everyone has their different recipe and how much sports can help with your mental health.\u0027He said he and Meghan had surfed before. We tried to get him in and told him we had a wet suit and surf board ready for him, but he said he couldn\u0027t. They were so engaging, they had time for everyone and really felt part of the One Wave community.\u0027 Mr Trebilco suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them. He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.He said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He then created Fluro Fridays - where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. Heartbreaking moment two-year-old is abandoned at stranger\u0027s doorPrince Harry and Meghan Markle visit a Sydney high schoolBaffled girlfriend gets answer to riddle wrong THREE timesPM could extend Brexit transition by \u0027a matter of months\u0027Jermaine Pennant jokes about lie detector test on Jeremy KyleHarry and Meghan bond with their fans on Sydney\u0027s Bondi BeachPrince Harry and Meghan Markle meet colourful locals at BondiPrince Harry and Meghan take part in \u0027Fluro Friday\u0027 at Bondi BeachJudge grants Ant McPartlin and wife a orce at London CourtCCTV captures a car on fire outside an address on Moody LaneCar seen departing as preacher Anjem Choudary leaves prison    The royal couple also met and shared jokes with local lifeguards (left), made famous by television series Bondi Rescue          Prince Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan are pictured meeting a young child during their Bondi Beach visit on Friday  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are on their official 16-day Autumn tour visiting cities in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand          Meghan is seen preparing to take part in OneWave\u0027s mental health awareness session on the sand at the world-famous beach          Meghan is seen laughing as she mingled with locals on Friday morning.

It\u0027s a sign of strength. Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health. It reduces that barrier.

It\u0027s made you confident, well-spoken. You have an intention set to really do something to change the world, and you have to keep it up.\u0027It makes me so emotional. You\u0027re doing really, really good work and I\u0027m so happy that we\u0027re here. We give you our full support.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t stop,\u0027 the Prince reiterated. \u0027Get more people involved, guys as well.\u0027 Teachers explained that the girls have been taking an \u0027integrated course\u0027 on top of their usual studies, to give them \u002721st century capabilities\u0027 including creativity and critical thinking, with \u0027a core focus on making a change in local communities\u0027. One project saw them make boxes of supplies to donate to vulnerable women via police stations and refuge centres, while in another they created notebooks to pass forward for students to write about the women who have inspired them. Coincidentally, one pupil had written about the Duchess long before the royal visit had been announced. Tahlia Ohenhen, 15, told the Duke and Duchess how another group had created picture books to teach younger children about poverty and encourage them to treat those less fortunate with kindness and empathy.          The royals look on during their surprise visit to the school in Sydney\u0027s west on Friday. The pair were entertained with a dance to the Frankie Goes To Hollywood version of The Power of Love          A student\u0027s tribute to Meghan is pictured during her visit to Macarthur Girls High School in Sydney on FridayThe couple nodded as Tahlia added: \u0027The younger you get your children educated on things like this, the easier it is for them to grow up and be aware of it and make a difference.\u0027 \u0027Kindness and empathy lacks big time in the world,\u0027 Harry said. \u0027It\u0027s so great you are passionate about all of this. \u0027You realise this is the generation that\u0027s going to make all the difference?\u0027 The Duke and Duchess were introduced to teenage boys and girls from the NRL\u0027s In League In Harmony project, which aims to unite young people from erse communities to be \u0027advocates for positive change in their communities\u0027.Sitting separately, with a mixed-sex group each, the couple listened to young people\u0027s growing up in Australia, and day-to-day lives. As one young man told the Duchess about his part-time job, she empathised: \u0027My first job when I was 14, I remember taking out the trash, all sorts. It give you a good work ethic, right?\u0027 She joined groups of students from across different schools in Sydney who have been introduced via the programme, which teaches them: \u0027Everybody belongs.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s so important,\u0027 said the Duchess. \u0027All these people you know of in your neighbourhood, now you know them and you\u0027re united. You\u0027re proud of where you\u0027re from, you can champion where you\u0027re from and make people see it for what it is.\u0027 Harry, sitting with a second group of youngsters, joked that he was \u0027clinging onto my youth at the age of 34,\u0027 said he now looked to the younger generation for inspiration.            Schoolgirls wait eagerly with their mobile phones ready to go before the arrival of the royal mother and father-to-be   Meghan wore a stylish monochrome dress by Australian designer Martin Grant as she and Harry arrived in Bondi on Friday           The prince opted for a more casual look compared with previous days, donning beige chinos and a blue shirt.

You guys get a kick out of that, right?\u0027During a trip to Bondi Beach, the Duchess of Sussex revealed that she had woken up at 4.30am to do yoga and told a group  it was \u0027so good for healing your mind\u0027.Meghan and Harry visited the famous beach for Fluro Friday, a session aimed at encouraging discussion around mental health which included an \u0027anti-bad vibes\u0027 circle and yoga practice.The couple arrived to cheers at 8.30am and were both presented with leis - a pink garland for Meghan and a blue one for Harry.Charlotte Connell, 35, was at the beach with her son Finn and said the duchess had been suffering from the \u0027double whammy\u0027 of jet lag and pregnancy.Mrs Connell, who is 23 weeks pregnant, said: \u0027Meghan told me that pregnancy was like having jet lag. She said she was up at 4.30am this morning doing yoga in her room as she couldn\u0027t sleep.\u0027It\u0027s a bit of a double whammy for her, she said, as she has both the baby and jet lag to contend with.\u0027Hundreds of royal fans took to the beach, hoping to catch a royal wave on the latest stop for Harry and Meghan on their 16-day tour to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.           Harry and Meghan meet Grant Trebilco and Sam Schumacher, founder and co-founder of OneWave, a local surfing community group raising awareness for mental health          The Duchess of Sussex removes her shoes after meeting Grant Trebilco and Sam Schumacher, founder and co-founder of OneWave          Meghan waves to the crowd as she and Prince Harry wind up their Bondi visit - as they prepared to make a surprise school visit        Meghan looked radiant in a khaki maxi-dress from Melbourne -born designer Martin Grant\u0027s 2019 Resort collection By Sophie Haslettand Alice Murphy For Daily Mail AustraliaDespite the damp and dreary conditions, Meghan looked radiant in a khaki maxi-dress from Melbourne-born designer Martin Grant\u0027s 2019 Resort collection.The $1,615 (£880) gown featured a straight, sleeveless neckline and full pleated skirt, with contrasting caramel and white stripes.The pregnant Duchess, 37, paired the contemporary design with $147  (GBP £80) Castaner canvas wedge espadrilles, but she swiftly broke with royal protocol when she ditched them to step onto the sand. The Pleated Stripe Long Dress is currently unavailable with online sale starting from December 15.   It\u0027s not the first time the Duchess has worn Martin Grant, after she plumped for the French-based Australian on Tuesday and Thursday with her stylish trench coat. Meghan kept accessories to a minimum, wearing a simple $418 teardrop pendant from Los Angeles jewellery designer Adina Reyter.The delicate, yellow gold necklace is made with 14 carats and pavé diamonds, and will be available online from October 22.

Meghan, come say g\u0027day.\u0027The duke and duchess met members of OneWave, a local surfing community group which raises awareness of mental health issues and holds the Fluro Friday sessions weekly.They then went on to meet the lifeguard stars of TV show Bondi Rescue - who presented the couple with a lifeguard outfit for their forthcoming baby.Lifeguard Jake Nolan, who has previously met Harry on Bondi Beach, said: \u0027He said that he\u0027d met us before - he came by the tower.\u0027We had a bit of a laugh because last time he was here he was out for a run and he said Last time I was a bit sweaty when I met you. We got them a little lifeguard uniform - mini shorts, mini shirt.\u0027Anthony Carroll, known as Harries, added: \u0027It was amazing, they\u0027re such beautiful, down-to-earth people. I\u0027m really humbled and proud.\u0027Four-year-old Olivia Rose Ryan was one of the last to see the duke and duchess as they left the beach.The youngster, who had been watching from her grandmother\u0027s balcony, held out a hairband to the couple and Harry did a quick U-turn from entering the car to say hello.Olivia Rose\u0027s mother Louisa, 38, said: \u0027He said thank you very much for the present for the baby.

Harry said asking for help was not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength. We need to talk about this stuff. No matter what you are going through you don\u0027t have to do it alone,\u0027 he said.\u0027Meghan shared how yoga is her escape, she does yoga daily and how her mum is a yoga instructor. Harry talked about how everyone has their different recipe and how much sports can help with your mental health.\u0027He said he and Meghan had surfed before. We tried to get him in and told him we had a wet suit and surf board ready for him, but he said he couldn\u0027t. They were so engaging, they had time for everyone and really felt part of the One Wave community.\u0027 Mr Trebilco suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them. He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.He said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He then created Fluro Fridays - where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. Heartbreaking moment two-year-old is abandoned at stranger\u0027s doorPrince Harry and Meghan Markle visit a Sydney high schoolBaffled girlfriend gets answer to riddle wrong THREE timesPM could extend Brexit transition by \u0027a matter of months\u0027Jermaine Pennant jokes about lie detector test on Jeremy KyleHarry and Meghan bond with their fans on Sydney\u0027s Bondi BeachPrince Harry and Meghan Markle meet colourful locals at BondiPrince Harry and Meghan take part in \u0027Fluro Friday\u0027 at Bondi BeachJudge grants Ant McPartlin and wife a orce at London CourtCCTV captures a car on fire outside an address on Moody LaneCar seen departing as preacher Anjem Choudary leaves prison    The royal couple also met and shared jokes with local lifeguards (left), made famous by television series Bondi Rescue          Prince Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan are pictured meeting a young child during their Bondi Beach visit on Friday  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are on their official 16-day Autumn tour visiting cities in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand          Meghan is seen preparing to take part in OneWave\u0027s mental health awareness session on the sand at the world-famous beach          Meghan is seen laughing as she mingled with locals on Friday morning. She and Harry spent about half an hour on the sand\u0027To have the duke and duchess down at Flouro Friday helped make mental health visible around the world,\u0027 Mr Trebilco said.\u0027One thing that really stood out for me was that Prince Harry said asking for help is not a sign of weakness. It\u0027s a sign of strength. Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health. It reduces that barrier. Those bright colours show we can make it visible and we don\u0027t have to go through it alone.\u0027 Bondi local Charlie Adams is happy the royal couple are using their influence to shine a spotlight on mental illness and OneWave.\u0027I think there is still a lot of stigma around mental health and it\u0027s great that Harry and Meghan are addressing that here today,\u0027 Mr Adams said. Heartbreaking moment two-year-old is abandoned at stranger\u0027s doorPrince Harry and Meghan Markle visit a Sydney high schoolBaffled girlfriend gets answer to riddle wrong THREE timesPM could extend Brexit transition by \u0027a matter of months\u0027Jermaine Pennant jokes about lie detector test on Jeremy KyleHarry and Meghan bond with their fans on Sydney\u0027s Bondi BeachPrince Harry and Meghan Markle meet colourful locals at BondiPrince Harry and Meghan take part in \u0027Fluro Friday\u0027 at Bondi BeachJudge grants Ant McPartlin and wife a orce at London CourtCCTV captures a car on fire outside an address on Moody LaneCar seen departing as preacher Anjem Choudary leaves prison    Harry and Meghan are pictured chatting with OneWave members, while a small child gazes adoringly at the prince           Meghan appears to clean sand from her husband\u0027s ear as they take part in OneWave\u0027s Fluro Friday session on Friday morning  The purpose of Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s visit will later come back into focus, with the prince officially marking the arrival of the Invictus Games in the Harbour City          Britain\u0027s Duchess of Sussex hugs a participant of Fluro Friday, an event organised by surfing community OneWave tackling mental health issues          Harry is seen pointing to the north while his beaming wife flashes a smile as they speak with members of a local surfing group          Meghan is seen shaking hands with Bondi Beach head lifeguard Bruce \u0027Hoppo\u0027 Hopkins on Friday morning Meanwhile, Jacob Andrews, 12, has met some of the world\u0027s biggest pop stars - from Justin Bieber to Selena Gomez and Rihanna - but as far as he\u0027s concerned, none match the celebrity status of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Friday was the second time Jacob had met Prince Harry, following an encounter at Circular Quay when he was seven.This time in Bondi, Jacob didn\u0027t get a selfie with the young royal - but Meghan took a copy of a picture he had taken with her husband the first time they met.\u0027I was nervous,\u0027 Jacob said of the wait at Bondi Beach. \u0027Mum was nervous.

Among others, Meghan spoke to fellow expectant mother Charlotte, who is pictured with her two-year-old son Finn          Meghan shared with a group of yoga performers she does yoga to stay grounded, while Harry prefers to talk openly          Harry revealed her prefers informal chats about mental illness, hoping to reduce the stigma around them          The  couple met with members of a local surfing community called One Wave, which aims to raise awareness for mental health          The community group One Wave aims to raise awareness of mental health and wellbeing, saying it\u0027s a strength to ask for helpThe couple spent around ten minutes listening to the experiences of other members of the group and sharing their own, laughing and putting their arms around each other.Jessina Oakes, 26, of Bondi, said she spoke mainly to the Duchess.\u0027She mentioned that she practises yoga,\u0027 she said.\u0027She said it helps ground her and she tries to find the time to make it part of her daily routine.\u0027Oakes also spoke to Meghan about the dangers of social media, particularly its effect on young people\u0027s self image.\u0027She said a really beautiful quote. She said flattery and criticism run through the same filter.\u0027She said it was very freeing that she no longer has social media.\u0027And just how great One Wave is making those connections with people and being able to support one another.\u0027     The couple spent around ten minutes listening to the experiences of other members of the group and sharing their own           Meghan told them yoga helps ground her and that she tries to find the time to make it part of her daily routine          One Wave founder Grant Trebilco said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health will help people across the globeTrebilco, 37, of Bondi, said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health would help people around the world.\u0027To have the Duke and Duchess down at Fluro Friday helped make mental health visible around the world,\u0027 he said.\u0027And it let people know that mental health doesn\u0027t descriminate.\u0027One thing that really stood out for me was that Prince Harry said asking for help is not a sign of weakness.\u0027It\u0027s a sign of strength.\u0027Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health\u0027It reduces that barrier.\u0027Those bright colours show we can make it visible and we don\u0027t have to go through it alone.\u0027    The couple donned floral leis as they met surfing and yoga members of the community          Members of the sharing group said the royal couple were relatable, open and honestDabriella Quayle, 37, said afterwards: ‘Oh my goodness, they were just so real, so relatable. They shared their own experiences, which was amazing.\u0027Harry said seeking help was the best thing he had ever done. He was really open and honest. He said it doesn\u0027t matter who you open up to, they don\u0027t have to be professional. Anyone can be there for you. It could be your best mate or a stranger. You just need to open up to them.\u0027She added: \u0027They talked about the strangeness of their own situation and the lives they lead but that at the end of the day they are just real people. They are just human beings.\u0027They said they were just like us in that people say lots of positive things to you and then they say one negative thing, and that\u0027s what gets you down.\u0027Meghan said how she did yoga at 4.30 this morning because of the jet lag. She says she is feeling OK, not too bad. They said they hadn\u0027t really had time to settle down and get their heads round thing, and they have another 70 odd engagements to go.\u0027          One member of One Wave said Meghan had a \u0027double whammy\u0027 of jet lag due to her pregnancy          Meghan revealed she had been up at 4.30am that morning practicing yoga when she couldn\u0027t get back to sleep           Meghan said yoga was her \u0027leveller\u0027, with the couple still having another 70 odd engagements to goAfter the circle the royals walked over to a group practising yoga. Nio Poniatowski, 25, said: \u0027Meghan said it was her leveller, it\u0027s what keeps her grounded, like surfing does for us. She said it was her escape.\u0027Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go.Surf instructor Sam Schumacher, 31, said the couple both revealed they had surfed, adding: \u0027The circle time was great. Two or three of us shared our personal stories.\u0027This visit will really raise the profile of what we are trying to do and the fact that mental health doesn\u0027t discriminate. \u0027It can affect anyone and that we all need to try and look after each other. \u0027I can see the passion in their eyes.\u0027Trebilco said the couple had been \u0027so nice, so friendly\u0027.

It give you a good work ethic, right?\u0027 She joined groups of students from across different schools in Sydney who have been introduced via the programme, which teaches them: \u0027Everybody belongs.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s so important,\u0027 said the Duchess. \u0027All these people you know of in your neighbourhood, now you know them and you\u0027re united. You\u0027re proud of where you\u0027re from, you can champion where you\u0027re from and make people see it for what it is.\u0027 Harry, sitting with a second group of youngsters, joked that he was \u0027clinging onto my youth at the age of 34,\u0027 said he now looked to the younger generation for inspiration. \u0027We\u0027re so lucky that wherever we go in the world, we\u0027re finding young people like you guys,\u0027 he said. \u0027This sweeping wave of kindness and optimism and empathy that\u0027s seems to be lacking in some of the previous generation.

We tried to get him in and told him we had a wet suit and surf board ready for him, but he said he couldn\u0027t. They were so engaging, they had time for everyone and really felt part of the One Wave community.\u0027 Mr Trebilco suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them. He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.He said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He then created Fluro Fridays - where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. Heartbreaking moment two-year-old is abandoned at stranger\u0027s doorPrince Harry and Meghan Markle visit a Sydney high schoolBaffled girlfriend gets answer to riddle wrong THREE timesPM could extend Brexit transition by \u0027a matter of months\u0027Jermaine Pennant jokes about lie detector test on Jeremy KyleHarry and Meghan bond with their fans on Sydney\u0027s Bondi BeachPrince Harry and Meghan Markle meet colourful locals at BondiPrince Harry and Meghan take part in \u0027Fluro Friday\u0027 at Bondi BeachJudge grants Ant McPartlin and wife a orce at London CourtCCTV captures a car on fire outside an address on Moody LaneCar seen departing as preacher Anjem Choudary leaves prison    The royal couple also met and shared jokes with local lifeguards (left), made famous by television series Bondi Rescue          Prince Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan are pictured meeting a young child during their Bondi Beach visit on Friday  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are on their official 16-day Autumn tour visiting cities in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand          Meghan is seen preparing to take part in OneWave\u0027s mental health awareness session on the sand at the world-famous beach          Meghan is seen laughing as she mingled with locals on Friday morning.

It\u0027s a sign of strength. Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health. It reduces that barrier.

Fiyaz Mughal, head of anti-extremist group Faith Matters, has spoken to the imam who was brought into jail to try to de-radicalise him.\u0027Choudary was put in containment that stops him engaging with other prisoners, but also given pastoral care to see if they could get through to him,\u0027 he said. \u0027I asked the guy who spoke to him if the de-radicalisation programme had worked and he said, \u0027No, he\u0027s got worse. He\u0027s hardened\u0027. He speaks in the mind-set of the victim. He sees himself as a martyr the state tried to silence.\u0027Choudary does not plan to directly challenge the conditions of his release, but instead is working out ways to get round them, Mr Mughal said.\u0027He\u0027s said things like, \u0027if someone wants to upload my videos I\u0027m not going to stop them\u0027.\u0027Mr Mughal added: \u0027He should have served the full term. It\u0027s a terrible day for victims of the attacks he has helped incite.\u0027We need a change in the law so that anyone named as the inciter in two terrorist attacks should automatically serve the full sentence.\u0027          Hate preacher Anjem Choudary pictured in the 1990s as a student drinking with friends who are reading Mayfair magazineDr Michael Kenney, of the University of Pittsburgh, who followed Al-Muhajiroun for five years for his research, said its followers were \u0027very excited\u0027 about his release.They had been dormant following his arrest, but are now expected to try to \u0027rebuild and revitalise\u0027, he said.And he warned it was \u0027entirely possible\u0027 that more of his followers would turn to terrorism, like Khuram Butt, who was part of last year\u0027s London Bridge terror attack and Lee Rigby killers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.Security expert Professor Anthony Glees, of Buckingham University, said: \u0027He is charismatic and a very gifted orator – he is the Pied Piper of Jihad.\u0027Those who are vulnerable to his warped messages will see him as a hero … who has been through the fire of imprisonment.\u0027Security sources say Choudary\u0027s conviction has raised his credibility among fanatics. In the past, his desire not to go to prison and, what was seen in some quarters as his cowardice by not going to Syria, raised suspicions that he was a stooge for the security services.      Hate preacher Anjem Choudary - who inspired some of Britain\u0027s most notorious terrorists - is to be released on Friday and moved to a bail hostel Campaign group Hope not Hate found he has been directly or indirectly linked to at least 123 Islamist terrorists.\u0027Anjem Choudary will remain the most dangerous extremist in Britain today,\u0027 said Nick Lowles, chief executive. \u0027This is a man who has inspired dozens to commit acts of violence.\u0027The security operation will include surveillance teams, monitoring devices and demands that Choudary adhere to up to 25 rules. He also faces being targeted by UN sanctions to freeze his assets, prevent him travelling and even enforce \u0027arms embargo provisions\u0027.Theresa May yesterday insisted safeguards were place to protect people from him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25c8a6f34d1982818417dbf5ad389cfda893d02/0_420_1050_630/master/1050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36210d01eb808f058c41059560e1e6bd","title":"share your best photographs of the week with us","story":"We’re highlighting the best reader photography in print in the letters pages of the .

The right soundtrack has the power to transform even a burger and chips into a fine-dining experience, at least according to research by Cornell University. Why? Because the music makes us eat more mindfully and even perceive our food more favourably.“Dinner parties are essentially about communication and the mingling of several different conversations, so you want background music that’s sophisticated enough to spark conversation, then melt away rather than competing with your chat,” says composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty recently topped the iTunes classical charts. So what music works best with different dishes? We spoke to a range of experts – from restaurateurs to party planners and composers to find out.Soundtrack for starters“I put as much thought and care into the music I play at a dinner party as I do into my cooking,” says restaurateur Asma Khan of the Darjeeling Express in Soho, London.Her favourite starter is a mutton shikampuri kebab, a recipe from the Royal Kitchens of Hyderabad. “It has a uniquely layered shah-jeera flavour,” she says. “You think it’s mild at first, then the cardamom and cumin spice blend hits you. Most people don’t recognise all the flavours, but this starter never fails to impress.”While guests dig in, Khan plays the classical Indian Sufi song Maula-e-Kull, sung by Abdida Parveen. “It has a very deep rhythm,” she says. “You don’t need to understand the words to feel the emotion in the voice of the singer: it starts off with the love between two people, then becomes deeply complex. Both the song and the starter have this incredible hidden layering, and together they set a rich, serene tone for your evening.”Your musical main“The right music helps the conversation flow, which is particularly important when your guests are meeting for the first time,” says Alice Matthews, founder of MotherHustler supper clubs.“I love the classical guitar interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Air on a G String, by Richard Mollenbeck,” she says. Like the vegetarian tagine she serves her guests, the music is about different interpretations of a classic, melodiously coming together to create something new. “I’ve discovered guests relax and enjoy themselves more when eating familiar food and listening to familiar music, but in a heightened, luxurious atmosphere,” she says.Sweet symphony“I love to cook with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, and my taste in music reflects that too,” says Henrietta Inman, author of The Natural Baker: A new way to bake using the best natural ingredients.“For a dinner party I’ll make my plum, blackberry and blueberry crumble, served with a rosemary and lemon syrup. The topping is crunchy and decadent, made with wholegrain spelt, oats and almonds.” And the perfect accompaniment? The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, says Inman.“It’s a beautifully tranquil piece by an English composer and it brings to mind a dusky evening eating outdoors, with birds singing in the hedgerows and trees hanging heavy with ripe fruit,” she says.The tune for cheese“The cheese course comes at a perfect moment to steer conversation into another direction,” says La Fromagerie’s Patricia Michelson, author of Cheese.She recommends presenting a five-strong board with Sinodun Hill, a nutty goat’s cheese the creamy, sweet and aromatic Beaufort Chalet D’Alpage Lincolnshire Poacher Double Barrel, a hard cheese with a distinctive savoury acidity from the chalky soil where the cattle graze a decadent Brie aux Truffes and Regalis, a ewe’s milk blue that combines sharp mineral qualities with a rich, floral taste.On the playlist is a classical composition with a jazz vibe, such as the Jacques Loussier Trio playing Bach. “It’s reflective and stimulating but soft and flowing, and these are words I often use when describing cheese too,” says Michelson.The finale Just as a digestif serves to calm the mood at the end of the meal, music plays a similar role. “One of the wonderful things about music is it fills in any awkward silence at the end of your dinner party, when everyone’s said an awful lot,” says Davis.“I love an Amaretto, but I wouldn’t be as didactic as to suggest that a sweet liqueur goes with sweet music,” he says. “Go for something cosy that welcomes guests into your own personal comfort zone.”For that, try downloading Rêverie Nocturne by Giulio Regondi or Liberty by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

Andrew Dickens investigates the nascent field of ‘gastrophysics’The relationship between music and food is much like any other great bond: partners, best friends, loving siblings – you just can’t imagine them not being together. Whether at restaurants, weddings, festivals, or a picnic blanket at Proms in the Park, they’re almost inseparable.But what sparked this passionate affair? It’s not like the first humans were chewing on a woolly mammoth when they decided that what the meal really needed was a conch concerto in the background – food was functional, music was non-existent. Then along came civilisation (jumping a few millennia of cultural evolution) and the romance began. And like many a good romance, it began with a party.“Music and food have always gone hand in hand,” says singer, songwriter and broadcaster Cerys Matthews, whose boutique festival, the Good Life Experience, gives equal weight to both. “Were feasts ever silent? No. Whether the Romans, or the bards of Wales, music was always present.“If the music is wrong, it negates everything, but when it’s right – bingo,” she says. “I remember, as a child, looking forward to going to my favourite Indian restaurant in Swansea. The food, the Bengali music, it all helped escape the humdrum.”Both music and food were important parts of ancient civilisation, the Romans in particular being keen foodies. Music would be played at all sorts of public and private gatherings, and those events – such as funerals, the theatre and festivals celebrating the gods – would frequently involve eating.Centuries later, the synthesis of music and food that remains with us to this day would come into being in the baroque and subsequent periods of classical music – not only were royal banqueting halls filled with waltzes, concertos and chamber pieces (some of which would have been the pop hits of the day), but food actually inspired the composers who wrote them. Famed caffeine addict Bach wrote his Coffee Cantana, Debussy wrote La Puerta del Vino, inspired by the wine gate at the Alhambra palace in Granada, while in Carl Orff’s Olim Lacus Coluera, from Carmina Burana, a swan sings from a roasting spit.But perhaps the most significant development would be the arrival, in the 18th century, of the modern restaurant – the kind of place we would recognise by contemporary standards, complete with waiters, set tables and … music. There are few places now where you can dine in public without a backing track. It’s a matter of some debate.“In a lot of the very high-end restaurants you rarely get music,” says the food critic and editor of Waitrose food William Sitwell. “The only noise is the chef. Other than that it’s complete silence.“But music when eating can create atmosphere – if it’s done right,” he says. “It needs to be done with subtlety. Great chefs are masters of many things, from decor to music. If your only gift is to cook supremely, you won’t get far.”Matthews agrees. “Music accentuates a meal, but getting that music right is an art,” she says. “If you’re in a big industrial restaurant, you can’t have tinny digital files playing. And you need old material speakers so that the music gets into your body. You can’t underestimate the power of sound. It affects our emotions.”It’s been shown that people are more likely to enjoy a meal if they like the tunes playing as they eat. The same goes when the cultural provenance of the food and music are matched, as Matthews alluded to when reminiscing about the Indian meals of her childhood. Thai music enhances the joy of Thai food panpipes pep up Peruvian, and so on. The effects go beyond that, though. Manipulation is a strong word, so let’s say music can be used to give our decision-making a little nudge.“If music is played too loud it actually suppresses our ability to taste,” says Prof Charles Spence of the University of Oxford, a psychologist and author of Gastrophysics: The New Science of Eating. “But if it’s played at a pleasant level, our association with that music can carry over. For example, if classical music is played, people spend more. If French music is played in a supermarket, they’re more likely to buy French wine.“The loudness and tempo, or beats per minute affect how we eat,” adds Spence. “As they go up, we tend to eat or drink to the beat. Some restaurants use fast music to get people out of the door quickly and slow it down if they want customers to linger. We’re pulled in certain directions by music.”And it’s not just how we eat that’s swayed by music, but also how we cook.“Music when I cook is therapeutic,” says Sitwell. “It can be anything from Mozart to NWA. I’d find it very strange to cook without it. Among professional chefs, again it’s a contentious issue – some think music is a distraction, while others insist, even thrive on it.”Anthony Bourdain’s eclectic Music to Cook By playlist is a huge hit on Spotify, while examples of music-loving chefs include René Redzepi of Noma, who asked Metallica’s Lars Ulrich to write the foreword to one of his books, and Jamie Oliver, who told us that Westlife are just perfect for preparing salmon.“Cooking without music is bland,” says Ben Lebus, founder of Mob Kitchen, whose connection with music is so close that their upcoming eponymous debut book comes with codes for carefully curated cooking playlists. “It’s like cooking without salt,” he says. “Cooking has a rhythm, like music. You can dance around. I like upbeat tunes. Rossini’s Thieving Magpie is a big favourite at the moment. Coldplay just ruins food.“I think my dream combination would be cooking spaghetti puttanesca to Van Morrison’s Cleaning Windows. That would take me back to being 12 and the happiest times I had with my parents.”So, music can be used to influence both our choices of what and how we eat. It can affect the way we cook. It stirs up emotions and triggers associations, and can just as easily ruin a meal. But we’re beginning to learn that music is more than just a mood-setter, even more than a psychological tool that can get us to shimmy our finger a few more rungs down the wine list: it can actually affect the way we taste food. It’s an ingredient.“I call it sonic seasoning,” says Spence, who has led the research into this phenomenon. “You can pick or make music because its sonic qualities seem to make flavour. A higher pitch might make sweet or sour flavours, while lower notes can produce bitter flavours. You can create musical menus: creamy music, umami music.”Is this innate or learned?“It’s not been fully tested, but it appears to be cross-cultural,” says Spence. “One suggestion is that we have some innate sense that’s been useless until now. We naturally correlate colour and taste, for example, so that green in fruit tends to mean bitter and unripe, so maybe we do the same with sound.“Another theory is to do with the noises we make when we’re babies. Across all species of mammal, newborns make the same oral and facial gestures when they taste things. For example, the tongue will stick out when we taste something sour, so perhaps the gurgles and utterances we make when our tongue is in that position stay with us.”Could it be that all of those high-end, music-free establishments are missing a trick?“Quite possibly. You do get places that are a throwback to the Michelin-starred restaurants of the past – silent temples where the food will speak for itself. Wiley restaurateurs and businesspeople know the value of music. I think it was the founders of the Hard Rock Cafe who said: ‘We play music because it makes people spend more.’”These hypothesis are being put to the test by one chef in particular: Jozef Youssef, founder of Kitchen Theory, which describes itself as an experimental gastronomy design studio. He works closely with Spence in a field they have dubbed “gastrophysics” – an investigation of how our senses affect the way we taste.Youssef’s Chef’s Table events have become one of the UK’s – if not the world’s – most exciting culinary experiences. They are multi-sensory, placing emphasis on texture, smells, visual stimulation, and very much on sound.“For years, a lot was taken for granted with taste,” he says. “Sound was overlooked when it came to flavour perception. The music was tied to emotions, to nostalgia. It was used to set a tone, such as Indian music in Indian restaurants. It still is. Here we create playlists that actually enhance the flavour of the food. It can even work the other way round. For a synaesthesia event we did, we listened over and over to one piece of music until we had inspiration for a dish. Every moment of our Chef’s Table experiences, from when you walk in for cocktails, to when you’re relaxing after the meal, is carefully influenced by music.“If people are sceptical, they should sit and relax with a glass of their favourite whisky, then play different types of music while they enjoy it,” says Youssef. “They’ll notice different characteristics being brought out by the sounds. The access we have to music now, through radio stations and streaming, means it’s easy to experiment.”There is, of course, a balance to be struck: a fine line between enhancing and getting in the way. “The keyword is congruency,” says Steve Keller, chief executive of audio branding company iV. “It’s about aligning the senses.”Keller comes at it from the other side to Youssef. With a background in psychology, followed by 30 years working in the Nashville music business, he now combines these two worlds, treading the ground between science and art to use sound to influence our behaviour and perceptions.He says that his aim is to “hack our perceptions”, and acknowledges fully that the mere mention of the word “hack” probably has you checking your bank statement. But he firmly believes that the clever use of music to influence the way we taste can have huge benefits now and in the future.“Throughout history, music has been part of the ritual of eating,” he says. “But we had no understanding of its influence. Through being intentional, music can improve a meal. It’s about how you use it. You know the ingredients for a cake, but it’s how you bake it that affects the flavour. The music has to sound good – it can’t be a cacophony. It’s not magic, either. You can’t make something spicy with sound, but ‘spicy’ music enhances spicy flavours.”For Keller, it’s not all about adding sonic seasoning to fancy meals. He sees a broader use for the science: one that could have a profound impact on lives.“If we dream about the future, we can imagine how you get home to your smart refrigerator and you ask it to look at its contents and provide you with a recipe for those ingredients. Then you instruct your speaker: ‘Hey, I need music to enhance pasta primavera.’ But what I’m really interested in is how this could be used in healthcare. For example, cancer and its treatment can change or diminish our sense of taste. Could music improve patients’ eating experiences? Could a soundtrack add sweetness for people with diabetes?”It seems the already intimate relationship between music and food is only going to get closer as our access to music continues to increase and artificial intelligence helps machines to crunch the numbers for crunchy sounds. And let’s not forget the wonderful possibility that our fridge and speaker could team up to provide the perfect evening in. Yet technology can only do so much and go so far. Deep down, the connection between us, food and music runs deeper.“So much has been marketed to keep products distant, to be desired from afar,” says Matthews. “But I think people are moving away from things such as celebrity DJs and just want to watch players play. The idea of our festival is to go out, enjoy music and eat good food. It’s all about doing the simple things.”And Keller agrees: “The future is more dynamic than static,” he says. “I would like to think as humans we crave these sensory experiences. It’s why people still enjoy music on vinyl – they can touch and smell it. Fads will come and go, but at the end of the day we will always be drawn to how we experience the world with our senses.”Quite so. Which is why we should celebrate the wonderful marriage of taste and sound why we should, with apologies to Shakespeare, for the love of food and music, play on.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

If the winning writer were to use every single one of the 6,000 words allowed them, that would work out at a fiver a word, which puts them on a par with that other well-paid writer of creative fiction, the columnist Boris Johnson.In straitened times for writers, you would think a prize bonanza like this is a good thing – but it cuts no ice with Philip Hensher, editor of The Penguin Book of the Contemporary British Short Story, published two years after his immense anthology-cum-survey of the British short story since c1700 and designed, in part, to compensate for some of the space-related omissions of the last project.Prizes, writes Hensher in his introduction, are detrimental to the current practice and status of the short story in this country. He begins with a fairly inarguable point, that literary competitions of all kinds are “mostly harmless if they form part of a healthy ecology” and it is that surrounding ecology – the decline in numbers of short stories appearing in newspapers and magazines, the fact that publishers have yet to properly exploit the possibilities of releasing single short stories in digital form – that is struggling.But Hensher expands his argument into somewhat boggier territory. In the absence of a thriving market, he asserts: “The only readership many short-story writers seem to envisage is that of the members of a judging panel … Just as medieval princes paid monks to pray on their behalf, having better things to do, so we pay provincial dons and actors between engagements to sit and read a hundred humourless two-handers about war crimes in Taiwan before declaring them to be worthy of the cheque, though not of readers.”This characterisation is funny, but is it fair? The truth of my experience is that much of the process is taken up with discarding pieces of work that miss their mark, or appear to have been hastily conceived and thoughtlessly executed. Sometimes, the ratio is problematic: too much chaff, not nearly enough wheat. And occasionally, one does alight on precisely the syndrome that Hensher identifies, which usually involves the collision of Big Ideas, the foregrounding of a style, whether it be minimalist or baroque, and a faintly desperate striving for originality.But I would contend this is not a frequent enough occurrence to support the theory of a general and destructive trend. And in the specific case of the writer Jonathan Tel, who Hensher notes has enjoyed vastly more success at prize level – including the Sunday Times award in a year that I was a judge – than he has at actually selling books, I don’t believe it applies. We simply thought his story was really good, and we hoped that readers would, too.One obscure fact of short story competitions is that they are often judged “blind” – handed to the jury in typescript pages, with no information about the author or publishing house matching up work to names only comes about late in the process. This means that the work is freed from its context, shorn of assumptions, reputations, biographical detail it confers a liberating feeling that is, alas, denied the anthologist or general reader.Many of the 30 writers featured in this volume come with fearsome reputations and track records: Kazuo Ishiguro, Jane Gardam, Helen Simpson, Martin Amis, to name just a few. Even recent arrivals to the literary marketplace, such as Thomas Morris and Eley Williams, have built up a significant following in a relatively short space of time (quite right, too: Morris’s story, about a group of Welshmen ripping through Dublin, and Williams’s, a poignant love story set against the brutal practice of cooking ortolans, are excellent).An interesting by-product of this is to see novelists exercising their talents over a shorter distance and, sometimes, with a quite different frame of reference. Zadie Smith’s story “Moonlight Landscape with Bridge” is a tense depiction of a politician making good his escape from a disaster zone it echoes themes in her long-form fiction and yet is quite distinct from it. Elsewhere, Hensher reproduces the second chapter of David Szalay’s Man Booker-shortlisted novel All That Man Is on the accurate grounds that it works as a discrete piece but it is also fascinating to see how much bleaker and more savage Szalay’s exploration of masculinity and the fear of the monstrous female body becomes when isolated from the longer narrative.Anthologies of this sort appear to invite a consideration of the state of play of a particular genre or style. Hensher chooses 1997 as his starting point, arguing that the Blair government signalled a shift in the public mood, and it also chimes with the beginning of the era of internet and mobile phone dominance, which is certainly changing our modes of reading, interpreting and even creating fiction.Unless one were to argue for a sort of metaphorical clairvoyance in the form of Mark Haddon’s “The Pier Falls”, which painstakingly details the collapse of a pier, and the ensuing chaos and loss of life, it’s hard to see the current political and social scene realistically depicted in these pages. Stories range from glimpses of personal life (apocalyptic in AL Kennedy’s opening story, “Spared”, and done with charm and compassion in pieces such as Jackie Kay’s “Physics and Chemistry” and Leone Ross’s “The Woman Who Lived in a Restaurant”) to more oblique representations of public events, such as Gerard Woodward’s narrative of the collapse of a political regime in “The Fall of Mr and Mrs Nicholson”.In virtually all, though, there is a noticeable lack of formal innovation many writers here may be drawn to the uncanny, or the liminal or subterranean, but they also still seem fairly convinced of the merits of putting words and sentences in a straightforwardly linear arrangement (there is no equivalent of the PowerPoint chapter of Jennifer Egan’s A Visit from the Goon Squad).Allowing for the vagaries of personal taste, or of a piece of writing capturing you in just the right mood, Hensher’s selection is of solidly high quality and his thematic arrangement – Love, Story, Men, Women, War \u0026amp Politics, Catastrophic Worlds and an Envoi, movingly consisting of a single piece by the late Helen Dunmore – nicely suggestive. But we have learned our lesson from the introduction: we shall not hand him, nor any of his writers, a prize, for fear it stops them writing altogether.• The Penguin Book of the Contemporary British Short Story edited by Philip Hensher (Allen Lane, £20).

What is going on in Europe’s aviation industry?Cobalt has become the latest European budget airline to go bust, following Danish carrier Primera Air, which ceased trading earlier this month. While the Cypriot airline had only two years of flying behind it, after stepping into the breach left by the failure of the national carrier Cyprus Airways, Primera had flown for 14 years. Both carried a fraction of the passengers of British holiday airline Monarch, which collapsed last year.The big players in Europe have long warned that smaller airlines would go bust, arguing that consolidation – them snapping up the minnows – was the way forward for the industry. British Airways parent IAG eyed Norwegian, which has defied predictions from a year ago and kept aloft, but still sustained losses. Perennial struggler Flybe issued a profits warning this week, sending its share price tumbling.The big one is rising fuel costs. The unexpected bonus of plunging oil prices saw airlines’ jet fuel bills drop dramatically from $120-$140 (£92-£107) a barrel for much of the decade to a low of $40 in early 2016. That led almost all airlines to finally make a profit. But now the price is back at nearly $100.Some airlines loosened the purse strings and committed to aircraft purchases or leases that the industry could ill afford overall: analysts talk of overcapacity, which can be good news for passengers in the short term with lower fares to fill seats, but may not prove sustainable.For some, Brexit – or at least the tumbling pound since the referendum. Fuel and aircraft are bought in dollars, but a large proportion of the revenue for IAG, Ryanair and others is in sterling.The uncertainty surrounding Brexit continues to affect confidence: Wizz Air has become the second scheduled airline, after Ryanair, to put a clause in its conditions disclaiming liability for flights grounded due to Brexit after 29 March next year. Whether Brexit-related or not, several airlines have identified falling consumer demand and forecast overall revenues to decline.Share prices are slumping across the sector, at almost three times the rate of the overall FTSE fall in the last month.

Let us put an end to this national humiliation. Around the world, Britain is increasingly viewed with pity or contempt. Brexit, were it to happen, would be the most consequential and gratuitous act of national self-harm in our recent history.It is now crystal clear that there is no available deal with the rest of the European Union that can realise even a fraction of Brexit’s stated objectives. The only good way forward is for parliament to put the question back to the people, and for the people to decide that Britain should stay in the EU. To achieve that, everyone who possibly can needs to turn out in London tomorrow to march for a people’s vote.Two years ago there was still a possibility that Theresa May might have built broad, across-the-aisle support around a soft Brexit, with Britain as a Greater Norway, staying in the single market and some version of a customs union. This would have been a poor second best, leaving the UK as a rule-taker rather than a rule-maker, but it might at that point have represented the least unhappiness of the greatest number.Whether a stronger prime minister could have pulled that off we shall never know. As soon as May decided to appease her hardline Tory Brexiteers, she put herself on the path to perdition. The ever more complicated, customised confusion in which she is now entangled, like a cat wrapping itself in a skein of wool, is a direct consequence of that decision to appease.I have worried in recent months about the apparent rigidity of Brussels’ negotiating stance, but the EU27 truly cannot be blamed for May going back on her own solemn commitment to have a backstop for Ireland unless and until other satisfactory arrangements are in place. Indeed, our European partners have now shown a willingness to go the extra kilometre, countenancing the whole of the UK staying in a backstop customs union and a longer transition period in which to negotiate the final deal.Yet the only Brexit now available before the deadline of 29 March 2019 is a blindfold Brexit. The terms of the actual withdrawal would be agreed, but the entire future relationship would be sketched out only in the vaguest terms, in a so-called political declaration. As a former minister in the Department for Exiting the EU has observed, Britain would be walking off a gangplank into thin air.Those who voted leave in 2016 are now all at sixes and sevens, but so are those who voted remain. Where there are two remainers you find three opinions. There are the “releavers” (now for leaving, in the name of respecting the referendum result), the experts struggling ingeniously to make the best of a bad job, and those still canvassing multiple variants of a softer Brexit. I have friends who take each of these positions, and I listen to them closely, but ultimately I must be true to what we all know in our heads and feel in our hearts: the only good Brexit is no Brexit.Then comes a plethora of objections to a second referendum. It can’t be done. The EU27 won’t give us the extra time. It’s so complicated. What would be the question on the ballot paper? It would just prolong the agony. It would make a toxic atmosphere even more toxic. It wouldn’t solve anything.Some of these objections are stronger than others. It will indeed be complicated to reach a simple choice. But far from prolonging the agony, this is the only way to shorten it. We have seen how difficult simply negotiating the withdrawal has been it would take many more years to thrash out and implement a new trade agreement. This way, the nightmare could be over by next summer. We’re going to be a ided country for some time anyway, so let’s at least be a ided country in the right place. And if the majority of British voters decide we should stay in the EU, that will be a tremendous shot in the arm for the whole of Europe.It is nonsense to say this would be undemocratic. Democracy does not mean “one people, one vote, once”. As the former Brexit minister David Davis memorably put it, a democracy is not a democracy if it can’t change its mind. Since we have had one popular vote, and have a representative democracy, the clearly legitimate path to a second referendum is through parliament.Now a great parliamentary moment is approaching, one that will decide the future of this country for decades ahead. Most MPs are genuinely trying to work out what is the right thing to do – and then to calculate whether they can do the right thing and still get reselected and re-elected. Yet the finely balanced parliamentary arithmetic is such that it will only need a few brave spirits to ensure that whatever blindfold deal (or no-deal) May brings back from Brussels is defeated in the Commons’ “meaningful vote”. Then it will be for parliament to decide whether and how to put the question back to the people.That’s why, after gathering at high noon in Park Lane, tomorrow’s march will end with speeches (from Sadiq Khan, Anna Soubry and Delia Smith, among others) in front of parliament. I participated in the first big people’s vote demonstration earlier this year, and while it was – with its pointed chants of “Where’s Jeremy Corbyn?” – substantial, colourful and jolly, the numbers were less than overwhelming. This time it needs to be much bigger.So here’s the message:If you agree with former prime minister John Major that the Brexit vote was “a colossal misjudgment that will diminish both the UK and the EU”, leaving Britain “weaker and poorer”, then march with us tomorrow. If you feel that the British have a historic and moral responsibility to help the island of Ireland move irrevocably beyond bloody sectarian conflict – march. If you want a liberal, progressive England, not the xenophobic, reactionary England of Tommy Robinson and the English Defence League – march. If you think the economic and cultural concerns of those who voted for Brexit must urgently be addressed, but that Brexit will do nothing to address them – march with us.If you want your children and grandchildren not to have worse life chances than their parents – march. If you are under 30 and realise that it’s your future that is being sacrificed, as explained by the subversively named pro-referendum campaigns Our Future Our Choice (OFOC) and For Our Future’s Sake (FFS) – then, FFS, march. If you care about Europe as a whole, not just about Britain, and grasp what a serious threat Brexit is to the whole post-1945 project of building a better Europe – march.

But the amount of schoolwork my children get is unacceptableBetween the hours of 6.30 and 7.15pm nightly, we sit down in my house to do homework. This has been a surprising addition to the schedule, given that my children aren’t yet four years old. More surprising has been my enormous hostility towards it while my daughters happily apply themselves to reading and writing practice, I pace in the background, indignant that the tiny amount of time we have in the evening has been annexed by the New York City Department of Education.What’s particularly weird about this is that I never had any objection to doing homework myself. I’m a fairly obedient person. If as a child I’d gone to a progressive school, I doubt I would have liked it, and I sometimes thank God no one thought of forest schools in the late 1970s. As an adult, I belong to a personality type that has never grown out of needing sharp deadlines to function, and I believe, somewhere in my core, that missing one means I will actually die.Plus I approve, at least in theory, of stretching a child intellectually. But slogging through worksheets after having spent six hours in the classroom seems to me, at this age, absurd. I have always been suspicious of the idea that some children and not others qualify for the tag of “free spirit”, and before now would have scoffed at the idea that homework puts undue pressure on the child. Well, not any more. (There is another gripe relating to the total lack of accommodation for working parents, who don’t see their kids until after 6pm, when everyone is done in for the day. But that’s a separate issue.)There is data to support my annoyance. In Finland, which routinely tops global education rankings, children only start school at seven – after years of state-funded nursery placements – and there is minimal homework, if any. Homework starts much later in many Manhattan private schools too, most of which work on a theory of play-based learning, only piling on the pressure when the kids hit third or fourth grade.The city’s state schools, however, are horribly shackled to the timetable of standardised testing. The rat race starts so young in New York that both my kids have been tested for selective state primary schools and will sit more tests after Christmas. And already I’m done with it, eyeing the progressive schools, dreaming of moving to a small island where they can knit their own curriculum and learn to press flowers.Instead, here we are, past bedtime on a Tuesday night, my daughters’ attention starting to wander while I beg them to do one more page and avoid a minus sign in the margins to indicate poor effort. After 15 minutes, they start losing interest and marking the wrong answers just to be enraging, and I find myself getting short with them. Welcome to the treadmill that will last roughly for ever.And so I do something that makes even less sense than issuing homework in the first place. After they are in bed, their worksheets half done, I pick up a felt tip and, putting it in my left hand to increase authenticity, do a poor job of colouring in a picture of an ant. This is a one-off, I think a stopgap until we can better manage our schedule. Who am I kidding?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59e01cbe8f96f4c73df53ff00efa385b9ea15ac6/0_3_650_390/master/650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06f12805cec3c80ef1f6bc36f187b41c","title":"giant wheels screaming fans monster jam makes a pit stop in sydney a picture essay","story":"The world’s biggest monster truck rally brought its thunderous engines, crazy stunts and mountains of dirt to a nigh-unrecognisable ANZ stadiumby  Alex McKinnon and  Carly EarlIn a massive underground hangar, deep in the bowels of ANZ stadium, 10 monster trucks are being tended to by their pit crews. They’re being prepared for the Sydney leg of the Monster Jam tour, the world’s biggest monster truck rally, and everything needs to be perfect. Standing more than three metres tall and weighing upwards of four-and-a-half tonnes, the trucks are a blend of raw power and carnival kitsch. Pirate’s Curse sports a hook on the side and a skull-and-crossbones on the hood, a giant plastic sword clenched between its teeth. Zombie features bloodshot eyes, a pair of ominously reaching arms and a mop of dank grey hair made out of what appears to be shag carpet. A team of mechanics adjust the immense shock absorbers on El Toro Loco, a bull-themed truck with fibreglass horns and a nose ring.Escorted by their parents, around a dozen kids are led into the pen and immediately lose their minds. Several make a beeline for Tom Meents and his truck Maximum Destruction, or Max-D, a spike-covered beast that wouldn’t be out of place in a George Miller movie.One of the sport’s leading lights, Meents has been driving monster trucks for more than 25 years. Besides 11 Monster Jam world championships, Meents has pulled off some of the sport’s most memorable milestones. In October 2014, he became the first monster truck driver to pull off a double backflip. In June 2015, he one-upped himself by successfully completing a front flip. In 2005, he dragged his old house into the middle of a field, jumped Max-D over it, then drove straight through it.“When I turned 16 and got my licence, I started putting bigger and bigger tyres on my street truck and began competing with that,” Meents says. “I honestly don’t know what else I’d be doing. Doing crazy, never-before-seen stunts, that’s what lights my fire. I feel like I was put on this earth to drive and work on monster trucks. I’m doing exactly what I wanna do.”Brisbane’s Rhianna Buchanan helps six-year-old Cooper scramble up the inside of her truck’s frame so he can sit in the cab. A professional stuntwoman and performer with freestyle motorcycle troupe Flair Riders, Buchanan made her debut as a driver in October 2017 after graduating from Monster Jam university, an institute set up by Meents in his home town of Paxton, Illinois, to train the next generation. With her truck Wonder Woman, complete with a light-up Lasso of Truth on the back, Buchanan is one of a growing number of female drivers looking to turn little girls’ love of big trucks into greater participation in the sport.“She stands for strength, boldness, fighting for victory. I drive her with those characteristics in mind,” Buchanan says. “Monster trucks turn everyone into that seven-year-old kid again.”Coty Saucier has driven the Monster Energy truck since 2014, but his love for monster trucks goes back much further. A self-described “gearhead”, he’s spent more time working on the trucks as a mechanic than behind the wheel.“I’ve wanted to do this since I was in diapers. The adrenaline rush is incredible. It’s like getting ready to jump off the edge of a cliff,” Saucier says. “You have to be at one with the truck. I spend a lot of time before each show making sure all my stuff is right. I like to walk out on the track before a show, feel the soil, the angles of the ramps. All my gear has to go on in order – head sock, helmet, right glove, left glove. It’s superstition, I guess.”Jeff Sinn is Saucier’s best friend and longtime mechanic. Their bond is more than professional – Saucier is marrying Sinn’s sister, Kelly, in November. It adds an extra layer to a job that is already high stakes, time sensitive and fiendishly complex. “It’s all solving problems very fast. A truck will go out, something will break, and you gotta figure out what it is,” Jeff says. “You might think you’ve seen something before, but the truck throws up something new all the time. And all this with an audience and a very short amount of time to get it done. You maybe have 10, 15 minutes to diagnose what’s wrong, disassemble and repair. We call it ‘thrash mode’.”Sinn rates Saucier’s background in mechanics as an invaluable asset in keeping the truck operational and the driver safe. As the trucks have become safer and more advanced, drivers have begun attempting stunts and manoeuvres considered fantasy not long ago. “It helps more than people know. Some drivers just say ‘I dunno, the truck’s broke’, but nine times out of 10, he can tell me what’s broke and where it’s broke at, so I know where to go,” he says. “Drivers are doing things in warm-up now that they couldn’t do at all 10 years ago. The technology’s come so far in such a short time, it’s changed what’s possible. It’s made the drivers hungry.”Despite flashes of heavy rain, the fans turn out in droves for the Party in the Pit, Monster Jam’s pre-show meet-and-greet. The trucks are on display in the stadium forecourt, propped up theatrically on paddock bashers. As part of Monster Jam’s family friendly image, drivers will typically spend upwards of two hours signing autographs and getting photos before retiring to prepare for the show.From the commentators to the oversized novelty mugs, it’s all aggressively American. Even the soundtrack is pure southern country, full of men pining for girls who feel like Carolina. Inside, the turf of ANZ stadium has been covered with plywood, protective plastic and tonnes of dirt, which teams of bulldozers coax into ramps and piles. It looks like WestConnex.It’s hard to make ANZ Stadium feel full, but even with the first dozen rows of seats cordoned off for safety’s sake the crowd dwarfs all but the biggest domestic sporting events. A low rumble from underneath the stands draws a flock of delirious kids to the entrance tunnel, where they practically stick their heads through the safety bars to glimpse the trucks warming up.When the trucks roar out into the arena, the air fills instantly with the smell of burning fuel. The noise is Biblical. The kids who aren’t shellshocked by the din of the trucks scream at pitches high enough to alert dogs. The truck’s meticulous paint jobs are lost under a thick coating of mud.Besides the headline stunts and big jumps near the end of the show, the main attraction is that great Australian pastime: the doughie. Many drivers falter during the doughnut competition, committing errors of form or commitment that leave the crowd cold. Megalodon, a shark-themed truck, spins wildly on its side before coming to rest nearly upside down, the shark’s face pressed sadly into the dirt. Bulldozers are dispatched to right it.But Meents is sublime, spinning Max-D so fast it seems impossible he’ll stay upright. Awarded a near-perfect score by the crowd-driven judging system, he grins wildly, pumping his fist to the fans.“Spinnin’ and grinnin’! What a blast.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c291046f9dd90eba8709d579a59c2bd1876d74f7/93_76_6360_3816/master/6360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b7082afd44080ebb8d2560baeb18151","title":"this is just the beginning freed activists return to fracking site","story":"Trio of activists freed from prison after appeal get hero’s welcome at site of anti-fracking protest On Thursday morning, the day after being released from prison, three environmental activists who became the first people to be jailed for an anti-fracking protest in the UK returned to the Preston New Road fracking site near Blackpool.Simon Roscoe Blevins, 26, Richard Roberts, 36, and Richard Loizou, 31, arrived to a hero’s welcome from around 40 protesters gathered there. “It’s helped so much while we’ve been in prison to receive all of your letters and to know there is so much support,” Loizou said to the crowd. Blevins said: “We had letters and pictures covering all of our walls, stuck there with toothpaste because that’s all we had.”Last month Blevins, a soil scientist from Sheffield, and Roberts, a piano restorer from London, were sentenced to 16 months in prison, and Loizou, a teacher from Devon, got 15 months, after the three were convicted by a jury at Preston crown court of causing a public nuisance.The men were prosecuted for taking part in a protest in July last year in which they climbed on to the cabs of trucks attempting to carry drilling equipment into the Preston New Road site and camped there for three days.The site has been a focal point for protests since October 2016, when the government overturned a decision by Lancashire county council and gave the energy firm Cuadrilla consent to extract shale gas at two wells on the site.The sentences caused outrage among environmental campaigners, human rights groups and politicians. Friends of the Earth and Liberty assisted Kirsty Brimelow QC, the head of the human rights team at Doughty Street Chambers, in appealing against the sentences, warning that the case could have a chilling effect on future protests.At around 12.45pm on Wednesday the high court ruled that the prison terms were “manifestly excessive”. Just over three hours later the men stepped out into the sunlight from HMP Preston after three weeks inside.He said prison had been different to what he’d expected. “Something that really struck me was that despite there being a really clear hierarchy of power between the people who were locked up and the people who had the keys, between the inmates there was a great deal of equality,” said Blevins.“Regardless of why we were there or our backgrounds or our families, we were all there together.”Asked why he thought they had received such long sentences, Roberts said: “There has been a couple of years of direct action here, with dedicated local campaigners blocking this site and stopping deliveries as much as possible, and they would usually get a fine or a conditional discharge.The men have been released on conditional discharge, so if they reoffend over the next two years they can be resentenced for their initial conviction, but all three are determined to continue to help the campaign in ways other than taking part in direct action.“In a lot of ways this whole process has been an amazing learning curve for all of us,” said Blevins. “We know a lot more about the courts and the legal system. We know what we need to do if we want a fair trial and the kind of information that we need to be gathering from the start.”On Monday Cuadrilla started fracking at the Lancashire site, despite attempts by protesters to blockade the entrance. However, like the others, Loizou was still confident fracking could be stopped in the UK.“I think this is just the beginning of something really big with regards to resistance to fossil fuels and resistance to injustice,” he said. “I think our imprisonment and Cuadrilla’s actions on Preston New Road have galvanised the environmentalist movement into action.”Roberts agreed. “We learned at school in the 1990s in GCSE geography about the impact that burning fossil fuels would have on the rest of the world and on future generations,” he said. “And it’s been so frustrating to get to 2018 and not see concerted action from government on this.“We’ve pursued democratic means, organised petitions and all of that, for decades, and now it’s only appropriate that we escalate and take direct action to stop the fossil fuel industries. We will continue to take action until we see change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e937b6d597e69aac5e1bbba9a08595378ea0c62/0_216_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23ad3ef34447926f55f44a21f23093f9","title":"uk recycling industry under investigation for and corruption","story":"Exclusive: Watchdog examining claims plastic waste is not being recycled but left to leak into rivers and oceansThe plastics recycling industry is facing an investigation into suspected widespread abuse and fraud within the export system amid warnings the world is about to close the door on UK packaging waste, the  has learned.The Environment Agency (EA) has set up a team of investigators, including three retired police officers, in an attempt to deal with complaints that organised criminals and firms are abusing the system.Six UK exporters of plastic waste have had their licences suspended or cancelled in the last three months, according to EA data. One firm has had 57 containers of plastic waste stopped at UK ports in the last three years due to concerns over contamination of waste. Allegations that the agency is understood to be investigating include:UK households and businesses used 11m tonnes of packaging last year, according to government figures. Two-thirds of our plastic packaging waste is exported by an export industry which was worth more than £50m last year.The exporters make millions by charging retailers and manufacturers a fluctuating tonnage rate for plastic waste recovery notes – currently £60 a tonne. Retailers buy these plastic export recovery notes – Perns – to satisfy the government they are contributing something to recycling plastic packaging waste.But the system – which was heavily criticised as open to fraud and abuse by the National Audit Office this summer – relies on companies making self declarations about how much packaging they are exporting. understands information has been passed to the EA – the regulators – which shows huge discrepancies between the amount of packaging exports recorded by HM customs, compared to the amount UK exporters claim to have shipped.The data, analysed by the , reveals British export firms claim to have shipped abroad 35,135 tonnes more plastic than HM Customs has recorded leaving the country.One source with knowledge of the inquiry said: “In the last few months the customs figures on waste plastic are lower than the figures given to the Environment Agency by the exporters – suggesting more people are shipping stuff they claim is waste plastic in order to get the Pern price.“Perns are running at around £60-70 a tonne, so that encourages all sorts of people to pursue the export market, and the question is whether the enforcement is strong enough to detect whether this is actually plastic waste being shipped out.”At least 100 containers of plastic waste a day are shipped out from ports including Felixstowe and Southampton to Europe and the Far East. Insiders said EA staff have never visited any of the countries or sites where British waste plastic is exported for recycling.Jacob Hayler, executive director of the Environmental Services Association (ESA), is one of many iniduals who has raised the issue of the discrepancy in figures with the EA.“We have flagged this and they are aware of it,” he said. ‘The agency and others are looking at how to improve enforcement … there is organised crime, and criminal gangs exploit the system, that does go on.”The ongoing investigation into corruption in the plastics industry comes as the UK seeks new international markets for its plastic waste.In January, China stopped accepting British plastic waste and exports shifted to Malaysia, Vietnam and Poland. But Malaysia and Vietnam have imposed temporary bans on imports and Poland is considering restrictions, a sign that countries are growing more wary amid evidence of high contamination rates.Figures seen by the  show UK exports to Turkey and the Netherlands soaring as a result. Several insiders told the  the export market – which the UK relies on as it struggles to meet a target to reprocess more than half its plastic waste by 2020 – could dry up within weeks.Phil Conran, director 360 Environmental and chair of the government’s advisory committee on packaging, said: “All these markets are effectively closing the door to the poor quality material and they are increasingly limited in what they will accept of the better quality material.“At the moment material is still being collected and still going somewhere ... but all the sense is that we have reached a tipping point and we simply are struggling to find markets for material that is being collected.”The new markets have brought more fears of abuse within the system. According to packaging declarations made by companies, the UK exported 27,034 tonnes of waste plastic to Turkey in the first three months of this year compared to 12,022 tonnes in the first three months of 2017. Netherlands exports have risen by nearly 10,000 tonnes in the first six months of this year, compared to the same period in 2016 38,207 tonnes in 2018 compared to 28,784 in 2016.The EA has been passed allegations that export firms are using the Netherlands to effectively launder plastic waste – exploiting looser controls over shipments to Europe – before illegally moving it out to other countries in the Far East, where they might struggle to get approval under the UK licence system.Addie van der Spapen, of Netherlands recycling firm Kunststof Recycling, said the country certainly did not have the capacity to reprocess increased amounts of plastic waste from the UK. “It won’t all get recycled. Europe is getting overflowed with the material from England, they are flooding Europe with their plastic,” he said.The growing market in Turkey is also raising fears that more UK plastic waste will leak into the oceans.One source said: “The concern about Turkey is more whether material is being stored to be recycled later, or not recycled at all and being burnt.”“The financial incentive for companies to fraudulently claim they have recycled plastic packaging is higher than for any other material,” they said.“There is therefore a risk that some of it is not recycled under equivalent standards to the UK and is instead sent to landfill or contributes to pollution.”Marie Fallon, of the Environment Agency, has confirmed to MPs an intelligence led central investigations team has been set up to tackle corruption and fraud within the export system.Fallon accepted the agency could have done better over the years in tackling abuses. In 2016-17 staff carried out fewer than 40 pc of 346 spot checks on companies it had planned. This year five export firms flagged as red rated for risk are still operating and 33 considered to be of medium risk are also still accredited to export waste."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e243f794d962857f9b5a7308f2573842e5738d9/0_125_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12730b3eb782d8892bab6dfa5a6f52e0","title":"the highway code review is good news for cyclists but should just be the start","story":"Close passing and dooring are serious concerns but there is more to be done to make our streets safer and cleaner, from funding boosts to road planningThe announcement of a Highway Code review for walking and cycling is a forward step for active travel and road safety. It may not be the millions of pounds of investment needed, but it’s a start.The Department for Transport (DfT) review will cover issues such as how to safely overtake cyclists, guidance on preventing car-dooring of cyclists, and giving pedestrians and cyclists the right of way at side roads.The announcement follows a consultation earlier this year, whose responses were published on Thursday. It is part of a series of small but helpful cycle-friendly moves from the DfT including cargo bike subsidies, funding for Manchester’s ambitious cycling and walking plans, and support for police close passing operations and driver training.Although the government does not go far enough in treating cycling and walking as a serious mode of mass transport, updating the rules that guide driver behaviour in this country, many of which are legal requirements, is a start.Close passing is something many people who cycle on the UK’s roads regularly experience, and research shows near misses do put people off cycling. West Midlands Police, pioneers of the close pass initiative, found many drivers they pulled over had passed their driving test decades ago and were never taught how to safely overtake someone on a bike. Sometimes drivers failed to notice a cyclist even after passing within centimetres of the rider’s handlebars. At the moment, the Highway Code, which is, in theory, compulsory reading, says drivers should give cyclists as much room as they would a car, but to some drivers that may be just centimetres. West Midlands Police advocate giving cyclists 1.5m. Updating this part of the code will send a clearer message to drivers.Dooring – opening a car door into the path of a cyclist – seriously injured 278 cyclists and killed five between 2011 and 2015. It’s already a criminal offence, punishable with a £1,000 fine, but updated guidance advocating the “Dutch reach” – using the opposite arm to open a car door – is welcome.The review could also mean drivers would be told to give way to pedestrians and cyclists crossing at side roads, not just those already crossing the road, as at present. This would be especially helpful to those less able to run out of the way of fast turning vehicles.All of the above issues are common sense, and in some cases already required by law, but a lack of awareness and cuts to roads policing mean they’re often ignored.Over recent decades our streets have become dominated by the motor car, with the attitude increasingly being that anyone stepping on to or cycling on them without unwavering vigilance for hurtling traffic, no matter how badly piloted, does so at their own risk. The comments on some of the news stories about the review reinforce this theory in depressing volumes.This attitude precipitates driving behaviour that scares people off cycling, and makes crossing the road far riskier than it needs to be, especially for the elderly or disabled. Modern thinking is starting to shift towards seeing our roads as public spaces for everyone, rather than just the minority rushing around in cars. The Highway Code could reflect this thinking and remind those with the greatest potential for harm of their responsibilities.Even better would be for the government to invest in cycling infrastructure on a long-term, sustained and strategic basis, and for roads to be designed to actively discourage speeding. Planners should make room for protected cycling and walking routes to make them more attractive than driving.Until the Treasury makes money available for active travel, instead of a misguided pursuit of ever greater motor traffic capacity – the very thing that’s killing us and choking our streets – the DfT is doing its best with what it has, and that’s a good start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40ed9875cd003cddddcd79d08b3833d188bbc6ee/188_649_6526_3916/master/6526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c8dc459ec9698a5431f7cdfa8f6bd14","title":"lets abolish school holidays jay rayner","story":"What is the least you can get away with giving your kids for lunch at half-term before it starts looking like neglect?Before we get going let’s accept that we all love our kids and wish only the best for the little darlings. Agreed? Good. With that established, let’s move on. Isn’t having to find something, dammit, anything to feed them across school holidays of the sort that are just beginning a total and utter pain in the arse?People who usually leave the house for work suddenly find themselves marooned at home, without adult company, standing in front of a fridge, the contents of which simply aren’t engineered for an extra daily meal. Those of us who always work from home have different issues. We usually pass lunch standing in front of the fridge, prodding leftovers to see whether they’ve developed a furry crust, eating salami straight from the packet and eyeing cautiously a half-eaten packet of cheese strings. As a result, we are justifiably baffled by how demanding our own children are. I give you breakfast. I sort dinner. And now you want more? Can’t you go out and get a job or chase a fox or something? So what if you’re only seven.From this comes a profound question one which goes to the very heart of middle-class parenting: what is the least you can get away with giving your kids for lunch during the school holidays before it starts looking like neglect, and the little darlings start emailing social services?Clearly at the top of this hierarchy of nutritional mediocrity is the bowl of curly pasta – don’t even think of trying to call it fusilli we’re deep in the nursery now – with grated drifts of plastic cheese. A big steaming bowl of complex carbohydrates has the virtue of making you feel like you cooked, which obviously is a fine and nurturing thing. But really, the effort! Come day three you’ll be properly bored of that.Which brings us to sandwiches. Are they OK? If sandwiches are OK, how about if you just nip out and buy them? Is that so bad? It’s what millions of people do every single day. In fact, wouldn’t you be doing your little ones a favour by introducing them to one of the key experiences of the world of work: the fridge-cold, utterly uninspiring supermarket sandwich, the eating of which represents the death of all your dreams and ambitions? Isn’t it better to ease them in to this stuff early?And what if, while patrolling those supermarket aisles for convenience items so they can get back to the killing fields of Fortnite and you can get back to arguing with the dozy git from accounts while still in your pyjamas, you happened to clock a few shelves of Pot Noodles? Obviously, they don’t feature highly on the healthy eating lists from the Department of Health. Likewise, the way they fizz when you add the water is mildly disturbing. But turning on the kettle is a kind of cooking, isn’t it? And that’s like parenting. Isn’t it? Or maybe you could just throw open the fridge door and get the children to form a huddle about your thighs, while you throw down the festering leftovers.At which point we must recognise that the issue of which I’m making light is, for those on low incomes, no laughing matter. We know free school meals can provide a much-needed form of support their removal during breaks is a cause of anxiety. So I’ve got a suggestion. Let’s abolish school holidays. It will rescue the kids from boredom, stop them discovering how unambitious a cook you are, and save dosh. It’s a modest proposal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f92cc84599ed5bb2f748f3fb1273d2e44d3d690/68_178_3445_2067/master/3445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69df6c362a427a5a3033848a78a3a140","title":"wembley fulham allegations shahid khan craig kline fa employment tribunal","story":"The Fulham and Jacksonville Jaguars owner, Shahid Khan, has said the withdrawal of his £600m offer to buy Wembley stadium had nothing to do with the allegations being made against Fulham by Craig Kline, the club’s former assistant director of football. Kline went public when he left the club last year with allegations, including racism, made in tweets which he deleted, and he timed his renewed intervention this year to coincide with key Football Association votes on whether to sell Wembley to Khan.Kline, a US university friend of Shahid Khan’s son Tony, has now made a series of allegations against Fulham and named iniduals at the club in an employment tribunal claim that he lodged on Wednesday. He claims wrongful dismissal in the circumstances of his departure from the club, victimisation and that a financial settlement he agreed with a duty of confidentiality is not enforceable against him. Kline left Fulham after a troubled few years at the club in which he repeatedly found himself in conflict with colleagues, then made a series of complaints internally and was periodically suspended.Days before the FA council held its meeting on 11 October in which vocal opposition was expressed to the Wembley sale, leading to Khan withdrawing his offer, the FA had said it was reviewing the allegations made by Kline after he had met a senior FA investigator. When Kline went public again on 8 October in a tweet, he made it clear he believed his allegations should raise questions over the sale of Wembley to Khan, saying he had “key evidence of systemic corruption relevant to the Wembley vote”. In subsequent tweets Kline alleged “fraud, child endangerment and exploitation” in football, and he has again claimed to have witnessed instances of alleged racism while at Fulham.Khan himself dismissed the allegations, saying via a spokesperson, Jim Woodcock: “This is nothing more than the same ongoing nonsense and bogus claims made by a former employee who left the club in 2017. Nothing here merits a further response.”Asked whether Kline’s allegations had been a factor in Khan withdrawing the offer for Wembley on Wednesday, Woodcock said they were not and repeated that Khan believes the claims are bogus. Woodcock pointed to Khan’s statement regarding Wembley, in which the Fulham owner said he could consider making a new offer if a clear FA majority approved it, as proof that Kline’s intervention has been irrelevant.Kline was appointed by Khan to work at Fulham in October 2014 after the club had been relegated from the Premier League. He had developed a statistics-based method of assessing players for recruitment but his approach brought him into conflict with other members of the football and recruitment staff. He began to complain internally, alleging racism and other improper practices, and raised formal grievances which led to him being intermittently suspended before agreeing a financial settlement to leave last year. Kline claims his allegations were never properly investigated by Fulham the club’s position is that they were.Within the FA executive and at the Football Foundation, the organisation responsible for investing Premier League, FA and government contributions to grassroots facilities - £64m in total this year - there was great disappointment at the collapse of the proposed sale. The Football Foundation explained that matched funding from local and education authorities could have doubled the £600m Wembley proceeds, for a total £1.2bn which would have made a huge difference.It said grassroots players were having to “put up with a stock of community football facilities that is in a shameful state. This would have been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make considerable inroads into probably the most pressing issue facing football in this country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7b3526a4e7c7004c17ed3d196cc9eef158e4ee9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87d6290a91732e3bd6c7bd577d05629b","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"José Mourinho will want to make a point at Stamford Bridge while Chris Hughton returns to a chaotic St James’s ParkIn Manchester United’s last match, against Newcastle, José Mourinho demonstrated some of the audacity with which he made his name. He made a tactical substitution after 19 minutes, swinging a game his team was already losing 2-0 back in his side’s favour. Two of the three goals United scored came from his substitutes. It was an impressive demonstration of a coach’s ability to affect a match, the only shame being that the transformation was made necessary by the appalling performance of his starting XI. United are still some way from convincing anyone of their outstanding quality, with the best team they have beaten so far ninth-placed Watford. If they are to set a new marker in the Saturday lunchtime kick-off against Chelsea, Mourinho will have to demonstrate his tactical astuteness again – only without the woeful opening this time. SBChris Hughton is probably much too nice a guy to indulge in schadenfreude, but anyone else might enjoy some sly pleasure as their well-run, stable, happy current employers visit the beleaguered, chaotic, despairing club that coldly sacked them eight years ago. There is a useful contemporary lesson here for the Newcastle hierarchy, should they choose to heed it: keeping a good, popular manager as happy as possible is highly advisable. It almost seems inevitable that Rafa Benítez will leave Newcastle soon enough, and while he’s not blameless for their current position in the bottom three, he’s at least something positive for their support to cling to. In many respects Hughton’s Brighton are the antithesis of Newcastle, a club who have done more or less everything right against one who have done more or less everything wrong. NM• Paul Wilson: Things bleak for clubs near Premier League basementThis week Pep Guardiola invited five members of Manchester City’s youth system to train with the first team. Philippe Sandler, the defender signed in the summer from Zwolle for around £2.25m, is 21, Cameron Humphreys 20, Iker Pozo 18 and both Adrià Bernabé and Alpha Dionkou 17. Given the quality of the players ahead of them in the fight for a first-team berth it is hard not to pity them, particularly in a week when Kevin De Bruyne’s anticipated return from injury marks an end to a period in which 18-year-old Phil Foden has had one less obstacle barring his own path to the pitch. Yet it is impossible to criticise Guardiola for not giving youth a chance, particularly in contrast to Saturday’s opponents. The 18-year-old winger Dwight McNeil, who has had one start and a one-minute cameo off the bench, is the youngest player to appear for Burnley in the top flight this season by a margin of nearly six years, with the 25-year-old Charlie Taylor their next youngest player. Including Foden, City have so far fielded nine players younger than Taylor. SBComing on against Spain, Nathaniel Chalobah became the first Watford outfield player to represent England since John Barnes in 1987. While it is clear Gareth Southgate did not pick his England squads purely on form – Chalobah has played only four minutes of league football this season – there is no doubting the talent of the 23-year-old and he finally looks to be rid of injury. His captain Troy Deeney said earlier this season that England’s new recruit is a £50m player in the making, having been signed for only £5m last sumer. Chalobah will be hoping to build on his international debut with a first league start at Wolves on Saturday, although there are easier tasks than trying to nullify Rúben Neves and João Moutinho. MBLife moves pretty fast when you’re Christian Eriksen. Between trying to sort out Denmark’s pay dispute, dispelling the myth (put out by your national manager) that he could have a chronic abdominal injury, and being heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid, it can be hard to focus on everyday matters like a trip to West Ham or signing a new contract. Harry Kane aside, Eriksen is probably Spurs’ only other irreplaceable player and would obviously be missed if he is not fit enough to play on Saturday. Derby matches against West Ham are always tight – just one of the last nine games has had a winning margin of more than one goal for either team – and the Hammers have been excellent at home recently against Chelsea and Manchester United. MBNot for the first time, the international break has resulted in a string of injuries for Liverpool to deal with. Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and Naby Keïta all returned to Merseyside in a worse state than they departed, leaving Jürgen Klopp with much to ponder before picking his team to face Huddersfield. Salah and Mané have generally been short of their best this season, so this may not necessarily be the worst time for them to be unavailable for selection. In their place could come Xherdan Shaqiri and Daniel Sturridge, both of whom have impressed when given the chance to do so. Also, given Saturday’s late game is the first of five matches Liverpool play in the space of 18 days, their manager needs to be managing his resources regardless of injury and illness. SNIt is interesting now to look back on the way Eddie Howe approached his first match against Southampton as Bournemouth’s manager. It came in the League Cup in August 2010, and was the clubs’ first encounter in 23 years and the first of three in a season when both were in League One. “You can’t compare us to Southampton,” he said. “Southampton are a massive club. It’s good to see they’ve got over their financial problems, because I think it’s good for us if Southampton are doing well. They have played us in pre-season and loaned us players, so we’ve always had a good relationship with them and I think that’s important.” Back then the Saints did the treble over them), but now Howe’s side are 10 places and 11 points ahead of them in the Premier League, have won five of their eight games to Southampton’s lonely one, and it looks like Southampton will need luck or charity to emerge from this meeting with anything but defeat. SBThe excitement about the youngsters involved in the most recent England squads was understandable given the talent involved. But among Mason Mount, Jadon Sancho and Phil Foden, a name was not just missing, but barely remarked upon. It’s easy to forget that there was serious talk that Gareth Southgate might have taken Ryan Sessegnon to the World Cup, but his absence from the discussion now demonstrates how quickly these things can change. There could be myriad reasons for this, but might one of them be his positional inconsistency? In six starts Sessegnon has been a left-winger, a left-back and a left wing-back: it’s no wonder the 18-year-old hasn’t been able to perform regularly. As his side prepares to visit Cardiff on Saturday, he is still incredibly young and getting used to the Premier League, but so far this term Sessegnon hasn’t been able to excel as his contemporaries have. NMThe signing of Bernard in the summer might even have looked a little needless for Everton: another No 10winger type to go with the 57 they already had. But he might turn out to be their most important acquisition because he could solve a couple of pressing problems in one go. The biggest issue for Everton – who host Crystal Palace on Sunday – over the last 18 months has been replacing Romelu Lukaku, with various inadequate solutions tried, but the win at Leicester last time out suggested that Richarlison could be the man: quick, direct, smart and physical. But that then leaves a gap on the left, which is where Bernard comes in, and as he has created a boatload of chances to date, he’s potentially solved a creativity problem too. These are early days, but for a club who have been so wasteful in the transfer market, this might be their most efficient signing for years. NMFollowing their 5-1 blitz away at Fulham there has, quite rightly, been much focus on Arsenal’s attacking prowess. At the back, however, the picture is less rosy. Arsenal have kept just three clean sheets in all competitions and have now been hit with the news that Sokratis Papastathopoulos is a doubt for Monday’s visit of Leicester City after he sustained an ankle injury in Greece’s recent defeat by Finland. Losing the 30-year-old would prove a headache for Unai Emery given the paper-thin nature of his centre-back options but it would at least provide Rob Holding with a chance to establish himself in the heart of Arsenal’s back four. The 23-year-old has started his team’s last two league games and generally performed well. Another decent display against Leicester and he may keep his place, even when Sokratis is available again for selection.

The money is intended to help with the production of children’s TV, programming in the UK’s indigenous languages and commercial radio.Many commercial radio stations are also in need of financial help, while indigenous UK languages programming could use a “welcome boost” of £3m, the government said.But a BBC spokesperson warned that the fund risked amounting to a public subsidy for private enterprise.“We’re in favour of a wide variety of children’s programming being made in the UK. However, we worry that this scheme will use licence fee payers’ money ultimately to subsidise big global media companies such as Netflix and Amazon, without addressing issues parents care about like online safety,” the BBC said.“Commercial radio has never been healthier and is set to benefit from further deregulation.

By  Kwame Anthony AppiahMichael Young was an inconvenient child. His father, an Australian, was a musician and music critic, and his mother, who grew up in Ireland, was a painter of a bohemian bent. They were hard-up, distractible and frequently on the outs with each other. Michael, born in 1915 in Manchester, soon found that neither had much time for him. Once when his parents had seemingly forgotten his birthday, he imagined that he was in for a big end-of-day surprise. But no, they really had forgotten his birthday, which was no surprise at all. He overheard his parents talk about putting him up for adoption and, by his own account, never fully shed his fear of abandonment.Everything changed for him when, at the age of 14, he was sent to an experimental boarding school at Dartington Hall in Devon. It was the creation of the great progressive philanthropists Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst, and it sought to change society by changing souls. There it was as if he had been put up for adoption, because the Elmhirsts treated him as a son, encouraging and supporting him for the rest of their lives. Suddenly he was a member of the transnational elite: dining with President Roosevelt, listening in on a conversation between Leonard and Henry Ford.Young, who has been called the greatest practical sociologist of the past century, pioneered the modern scientific exploration of the social lives of the English working class. He did not just aim to study class, though he aimed to ameliorate the damage he believed it could do. The Dartington ideal was about the cultivation of personality and aptitudes whatever form they took, and the British class structure plainly impeded this ideal. What would supplant the old, caste-like system of social hierarchy? For many today, the answer is “meritocracy” – a term that Young himself coined 60 years ago. Meritocracy represents a vision in which power and privilege would be allocated by inidual merit, not by social origins.Inspired by the meritocratic ideal, many people these days are committed to a view of how the hierarchies of money and status in our world should be organised. We think that jobs should go not to people who have connections or pedigree, but to those best qualified for them, regardless of their background. Occasionally, we will allow for exceptions – for positive discrimination, say, to help undo the effects of previous discrimination. But such exceptions are provisional: when the bigotries of sex, race, class and caste are gone, the exceptions will cease to be warranted. We have rejected the old class society. In moving toward the meritocratic ideal, we have imagined that we have retired the old encrustations of inherited hierarchies. As Young knew, that is not the real story.Young hated the term “welfare state” – he said that it smelled of carbolic – but before he turned 30 he had helped create one. As the director of the British Labour party’s research office, he drafted large parts of the manifesto on which the party won the 1945 election. The manifesto, “Let Us Face the Future”, called for “the establishment of the Socialist Commonwealth of Great Britain – free, democratic, efficient, progressive, public-spirited, its material resources organised in the service of the British people”. Soon the party, as it promised, raised the school-leaving age to 16, increased adult education, improved public housing, made public secondary school education free, created a national health service and provided social security for all.Just as happened in the US, college attendance shot up in Britain after the second world war, and one of the main indicators of class was increasingly whether you had been to university. The middle-class status of meagerly compensated librarians reflected a vocational requirement for an education beyond secondary school that the better-paid assembly-line workers were working-class reflected the absence of such a requirement. Working-class consciousness – legible in the very name of the Labour party, founded in 1900 – spoke of class mobilisation, of workers securing their interests. The emerging era of education, by contrast, spoke of class mobility – blue collars giving way to white. Would mobility undermine class consciousness?These questions preyed on Young. Operating out of a community studies institute he set up in Bethnal Green, he helped create and nurture dozens and dozens of programmes and organisations, all attending to social needs he had identified. The Consumers’ Association was his brainchild, along with its magazine, Which?. So was the Open University, which has taught more than 2 million students since Young founded it in 1969, making it the largest academic institution in the UK by enrolment. Yet education mattered to him not just as a means of mobility, but as a way to make people more forceful as citizens, whatever their station – less easily bulldozed by commercial developers or the government planners of Whitehall. Late in life, he even set up the School for Social Entrepreneurs. Over the decades, he wanted to strengthen the social networks – the “social capital”, as social scientists say these days – of communities that get pushed around by those who were increasingly claiming a lion’s share of society’s power and wealth.What drove him was his sense that class hierarchies would resist the reforms he helped implement. He explained how it would happen in a 1958 satire, his second best-seller, entitled The Rise of the Meritocracy. Like so many phenomena, meritocracy was named by an enemy. Young’s book was ostensibly an analysis written in 2033 by a historian looking back at the development over the decades of a new British society. In that distant future, riches and rule were earned, not inherited. The new ruling class was determined, the author wrote, by the formula “IQ + effort  merit”. Democracy would give way to rule by the cleverest – “not an aristocracy of birth, not a plutocracy of wealth, but a true meritocracy of talent.” This is the first published appearance of the word “meritocracy”, and the book aimed to show what a society governed on this principle would look like.Young’s vision was decidedly dystopian. As wealth increasingly reflects the innate distribution of natural talent, and the wealthy increasingly marry one another, society sorts into two main classes, in which everyone accepts that they have more or less what they deserve. He imagined a country in which “the eminent know that success is a just reward for their own capacity, their own efforts”, and in which the lower orders know that they have failed every chance they were given. “They are tested again and again … If they have been labelled ‘dunce’ repeatedly they cannot any longer pretend their image of themselves is more nearly a true, unflattering reflection.”But one immediate difficulty was that, as Young’s narrator concedes, “nearly all parents are going to try to gain unfair advantages for their offspring”. And when you have inequalities of income, one thing people can do with extra money is to pursue that goal. If the financial status of your parents helped determine your economic rewards, you would no longer be living by the formula that “IQ + effort  merit”.Young, who died in 2002 at the age of 86, saw what was happening. “Education has put its seal of approval on a minority,” he wrote, “and its seal of disapproval on the many who fail to shine from the time they are relegated to the bottom streams at the age of seven or before.” What should have been mechanisms of mobility had become fortresses of privilege. He saw an emerging cohort of mercantile meritocrats who can be insufferably smug, much more so than the people who knew they had achieved advancement not on their own merit but because they were, as somebody’s son or daughter, the beneficiaries of nepotism. The newcomers can actually believe they have morality on their side. So assured have the elite become that there is almost no block on the rewards they arrogate to themselves.The carapace of “merit”, Young argued, had only inoculated the winners from shame and reproach.Americans, unlike the British, don’t talk much about working-class consciousness it is sometimes said that all Americans are, by self-conception, middle class. But this, it turns out, is not currently what Americans themselves think. In a 2014 National Opinion Research Center survey, more Americans identified as working-class than as middle-class. One (but only one) strand of the populism that tipped Donald Trump into power expressed resentment toward a class defined by its education and its values: the cosmopolitan, degree-laden people who dominate the media, the public culture and the professions in the US. Clinton swept the 50 most educated counties, as Nate Silver noted shortly after the 2016 election Trump swept the 50 least. Populists think that liberal elites look down on ordinary Americans, ignore their concerns and use their power to their own advantage. They may not call them an upper class, but the indices that populists use to define them – money, education, connections, power – would have picked out the old upper and upper-middle classes of the last century.And many white working-class voters feel a sense of subordination, derived from a lack of formal education, and that can play a part in their politics. Back in the early 1970s, the sociologists Richard Sennett and Jonathan Cobb recorded these attitudes in a study memorably titled The Hidden Injuries of Class. This sense of vulnerability is perfectly consistent with feeling superior in other ways. Working-class men often think that middle-class and upper-class men are unmanly or undeserving. Still, a significant portion of what we call the American white working class has been persuaded that, in some sense, they do not deserve the opportunities that have been denied to them.They may complain that minorities have unfair advantages in the competition for work and the distribution of government benefits. Nevertheless, they do not think it is wrong either that they do not get jobs for which they believe they are not qualified, or that the jobs for which they are qualified are typically less well paid. They think minorities are getting “handouts” – and men may feel that women are getting unfair advantages, too – but they don’t think the solution is to demand handouts for themselves. They are likely to regard the treatment of racial minorities as an exception to the right general rule: they think the US mostly is and certainly should be a society in which opportunities belong to those who have earned them.If a new dynastic system is nonetheless taking shape, you might conclude that meritocracy has faltered because, as many complain, it isn’t meritocratic enough. If talent is capitalised efficiently only in high tax brackets, you could conclude that we have simply failed to achieve the meritocratic ideal. Maybe it is not possible to give everyone equally good parenting, but you could push more rigorously for merit, making sure every child has the educational advantages and is taught the social tricks that successful families now hoard for their children. Why isn’t that the right response?Because, Young believed, the problem was not just with how the prizes of social life were distributed it was with the prizes themselves. A system of class filtered by meritocracy would, in his view, still be a system of class: it would involve a hierarchy of social respect, granting dignity to those at the top, but denying respect and self-respect to those who did not inherit the talents and the capacity for effort that, combined with proper education, would give them access to the most highly remunerated occupations. This is why the authors of his fictional Chelsea Manifesto – which, in The Rise of the Meritocracy, is supposed to serve as the last sign of resistance to the new order – ask for a society that “both possessed and acted upon plural values”, including kindliness, courage and sensitivity, so all had a chance to “develop his own special capacities for leading a rich life”. Even if you were somehow upholding “IQ + effort  merit”, then your equation was sponsoring a larger inequality.This alternative vision, in which each of us takes our allotment of talents and pursues a distinctive set of achievements and the self-respect they bring, was one that Young had learned from his schooling at Dartington Hall. And his profound commitment to social equality can seem, in the mode of schoolhouse utopias, quixotic. Yet it draws on a deeper philosophical picture. The central task of ethics is to ask what it is for a human life to go well. A plausible answer is that living well means meeting the challenge set by three things: your capacities, the circumstances into which you were born, and the projects that you yourself decide are important. Because each of us comes equipped with different talents and is born into different circumstances, and because people choose their own projects, each of us faces his or her own challenge. There is no comparative measure that would enable an assessment of whether your life or my life is better Young was right to protest the idea that “people could be put into rank order of worth”. What matters in the end is not how we rank against others. We do not need to find something that we do better than anyone else what matters, to the Dartingtonians, is simply that we do our best.The ideal of meritocracy, Young understood, confuses two different concerns. One is a matter of efficiency the other is a question of human worth. If we want people to do difficult jobs that require talent, education, effort, training and practice, we need to be able to identify candidates with the right combination of aptitude and willingness and provide them incentives to train and practice.Because there will be a limited supply of educational and occupational opportunities, we will have to have ways of allocating them – some principles of selection to match people to positions, along with appropriate incentives to ensure the necessary work gets done. If these principles of selection have been reasonably designed, we can say, if we like, that the people who meet the criteria for entering the schools or getting the jobs “merit” those positions. This is, to enlist some useful philosophers’ jargon, a matter of “institutional desert”. People deserve these positions in the sense in which people who buy winning lottery tickets deserve their winnings: they got them by a proper application of the rules.Institutional desert, however, has nothing to do with the intrinsic worthiness of the people who get into college or who get the jobs, any more than lottery winners are people of special merit and losers are somehow less worthy. Even on the highest levels of achievement, there is enormous contingency at play. If Einstein had been born a century earlier, he might have made no momentous contributions to his field a Mozart who came of age in the early 20th century and trained on 12-tone rows might not have done so either. Neither might have made much use of their aptitudes had they grown up among the Amazonian Nukak.And, of course, the capacity for hard work is itself the result of natural endowments and upbringing. So neither talent nor effort, the two things that would determine rewards in the world of the meritocracy, is itself something earned. People who have, as The Rise of the Meritocracy bluntly put it, been repeatedly “labelled ‘dunce’” still have capacities and the challenge of making a meaningful life. The lives of the less successful are not less worthy than those of others, but not because they are as worthy or more worthy. There is simply no sensible way of comparing the worth of human lives.Put aside the vexed notion of “merit”, and a simpler picture emerges. Money and status are rewards that can encourage people to do the things that need doing. A well-designed society will elicit and deploy developed talent efficiently. The social rewards of wealth and honour are inevitably going to be unequally shared, because that is the only way they can serve their function as incentives for human behaviour. But we go wrong when we deny not only the merit but the dignity of those whose luck in the genetic lottery and in the historical contingencies of their situation has left them less rewarded.Yes, people will inevitably want to share both money and status with those they love, seeking to get their children financial and social rewards. But we should not secure our children’s advantages in a way that denies a decent life to the children of others. Each child should have access to a decent education, suitable to her talents and her choices each should be able to regard him- or herself with self-respect. Further democratising the opportunities for advancement is something we know how to do, even if the state of current politics in Britain and the US has made it increasingly unlikely that it will be done anytime soon. But such measures were envisaged in Young’s meritocratic dystopia, where inheritance was to hold little sway. His deeper point was that we also need to apply ourselves to something we do not yet quite know how to do: to eradicate contempt for those who are disfavoured by the ethic of effortful competition.“It is good sense to appoint inidual people to jobs on their merit,” Young wrote. “It is the opposite when those who are judged to have merit of a particular kind harden into a new social class without room in it for others.” The goal is not to eradicate hierarchy and to turn every mountain into a salt flat we live in a plenitude of incommensurable hierarchies, and the circulation of social esteem will always benefit the better novelist, the more important mathematician, the savvier businessman, the faster runner, the more effective social entrepreneur. We cannot fully control the distribution of economic, social and human capital, or eradicate the intricate patterns that emerge from these overlaid grids. But class identities do not have to internalise those injuries of class. It remains an urgent collective endeavour to revise the ways we think about human worth in the service of moral equality.This can sound utopian, and, in its fullest conception, it undoubtedly is. Yet nobody was more practical-minded than Young, institution-builder par excellence. It is true that the stirrings of Young’s conscience responded to the personal as well as the systemic dying of cancer in a hospital ward, he worried whether the contractor-supplied African immigrants who wheeled around the food trolleys were getting minimum wage. But his compassion was welded to a sturdy sense of the possible. He did not merely dream of reducing inherited privilege he devised concrete measures to see that it happened, in the hope that all citizens could have the chance to develop their “own special capacities for leading a rich life”. He had certainly done exactly that himself. In the imaginary future of The Rise of the Meritocracy, there was still a House of Lords, but it was occupied solely by people who had earned their places there through distinguished public service. If anyone had merited a place in that imaginary legislature, it would have been him.That was far from true of the House of Lords he grew up with, which was probably one reason why his patron Leonard Elmhirst declined a peerage when offered one in the 1940s in the circles he moved in, he made clear, “acceptance would neither be easy for me to explain nor easy for my friends to comprehend”. So it is more than a little ironic that when Young, the great egalitarian, was offered a peerage in 1978, he took it. Naturally, he chose for himself the title Baron Young of Dartington, honouring the institution he had served as a trustee since the age of 27. As you would expect, he used the opportunity to speak about the issues that moved him in the upper house of the British parliament. But there is a further, final irony. A major reason he had accepted the title (“guardedly”, as he told his friends) was that he was having difficulties meeting the expense of travelling up to London from his home in the country. Members of the Lords not only got a daily allowance if they attended the house they got a pass to travel free on the railways. Michael Young entered the aristocracy because he needed the money.This article originally appeared in the New York Review of Books.

Mercer, who left the army in 2012, replied: “I wouldn’t go and vote. Just being honest, I wouldn’t vote. Of course I wouldn’t, no.”Asked whether he would join the Conservatives, Mercer said: “If the situation was like it is now, I can safely say there would be absolutely no chance that I would try and be a member of parliament.”Mercer, one of the more publicly prominent – and self-confident – members of the newer intake of Tory MPs, also indicated he had turned down a role in government and could never serve under May.He said he was “asked to do a certain role and made it clear that I couldn’t for one reason or another”, adding: “I mean, would I want to be part of this administration? No.”Mercer was blunter still about the current government, despite calling himself “inherently a team player”. “But when you go home from here on a Thursday and go for a run across Dartmoor or whatever, and you’re stripped to your core being, I mean, yeah, you realise it’s a shitshow,” he said.The Brexit process had left the government and Tory party “in a position now where people are beginning to ridicule us”, said Mercer, who campaigned for remain in the EU referendum. He argued that the chaos could prompt voters to elect a Jeremy Corbyn government.He told the magazine: “They’ll think, ‘Why should I vote for your government? Yeah all right, you might sort out Brexit eventually but actually, my operation was cancelled again last week. So, to be frank, I’m going to start looking elsewhere.’”Mercer was scathing about the wider leadership of the Conservatives, and by implication May, saying too many senior party people were based in safe seats. Mercer took his constituency from Labour in 2015, initially with a majority of 1,000.“The party will never really change until you have somebody who is leading the party who has won a seat and knows what it’s like to go out every weekend and advocate for what you just voted for that week,” he said.He added: “We’ve lost focus on that for some very good, very capable but ultimately technocrats and managers. That’s not what Britain’s about.”Mercer condemned May’s Chequers proposal for Brexit as “your classic professional politician’s answer”, which sought endless compromise and ended up pleasing no one.Despite his many prescriptions for how the party and politics in general could work for the better, Mercer insisted he did not necessarily want to become prime minister.He said: “My ambition here has always been to be defence secretary. I’d love to be a defence secretary who had 10 years to rip apart that department, make it work, get the offer right to our young people. We are such an amazing, proud military nation. It’s really tough to see what’s going on now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c45a1575ffcb03dbd75b2a67cf2bc445e014d24c/0_90_5897_3538/master/5897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31e78f8278aba44195bbddeedde35e2b","title":"tell us are you taking part in the peoples vote march","story":"Share your views if you plan to be in London on 20 October and tell us a little about whyThousands of people are expected to march in London on Saturday calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.Organisers of the People’s Vote March for the Future demonstration on 20 October say they hope at least 100,000 people will attend after similar numbers were seen in June.Theresa May has repeatedly rejected the idea of a second referendum on Brexit, but on Wednesday said she was open to extending the transition period in an effort to solve the Irish border issue.We would like to find out more about your views on the concept of a people’s vote and the march in London.

Once the spacecraft has been delivered into orbit around Mercury by the ESA-built Mercury Transfer Module, it will split to lose a protective sunshield and release the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter, built by the Japanese, and the Mercury Planetary Orbiter, built by the Europeans.Despite being just 58m km from the sun, Mercury has rarely been in the spotlight.Only two previous missions have examined the planet’s properties – Nasa’s Mariner 10 probe, launched in 1973, and the more recent Messenger mission, which launched in 2004. The latest endeavour takes its named from the late Giuseppe “Bepi” Colombo, a professor at the University of Padua who was a key figure in devising Mariner 10’s Mercury fly-bys.Mercury was also found to have an exosphere – a very thin layer above the surface composed of atoms and molecules that have come from the crust and solar wind.But before BepiColombo can probe such phenomena, it must negotiate two major hurdles.The Japanese orbiter will spin 15 times a minute to avoid being toasted, like a kebab on a barbecue, while the European orbiter will be wrapped in a special multi-layer blanket and have a radiator for protection.Getting to Mercury is also a head-scratcher.“Mercury is a small body close to the sun, so you could fly straight towards Mercury and get there in a few months, but you can’t stop because the sun’s gravity sucks you in,” said Imber.The answer is to arrive slowly via an elegant series of laps, with the spacecraft swinging by Earth, Venus and Mercury before entering an orbit around the closest planet to the sun in late 2025, then splitting and beginning operations in early 2026.“We are passing once by the Earth, twice Venus and six times Mercury,” said Zender. “We are going so close to the inidual planets that we can use their gravitational forces to change our direction for the next step.”The team also plan to examine features of Venus including its internal structure, its chemical composition and its interaction with solar radiation.Once in orbit around Mercury, the instruments will set to work. An x-ray telescope, MIXS will help to shed light on the makeup of the planet.“We are going to know in really incredible detail what the surface of Mercury is made of,” said Imber, adding that the team can probe deeper down, too. “When you form an impact crater what you find is that layers of material from under the surface are lifted by the impact and land on the surface,” she said. Prof Nicolas Thomas, co-project manager of the Bela instrument aboard the Mercury Planetary Orbiter, said he wants to investigate the planet’s curious surface features.“A planet will shrink as it cools and Mercury has cooled a lot – we think the planet has cooled in such a way that its radius has been reduced by 8km over its history,” he said. “There are huge great cliffs that we suspect have been created by this process where this shrinking has gone on but some bits have shrunk and other bits haven’t shrunk quite so much.”It is a phenomenon Bela will help probe.“What we do is that we take a seriously large, very scary powerful laser and we fire it up to about 1,000km away from the planet and then we wait for 6-10 milliseconds and we look at the reflected pulse,” said Thomas. By looking at the time it has taken for the light to return, the team can calculate the contours of the surface below, essentially mapping Mercury.While the BepiColombo mission is expected to last for two years once the orbiters are in position around Mercury, the team say it might continue for longer. Once over, the orbiters will be crashed into the planet’s surface.For now, though, the team are focused on the launch. “You’ve put 15 years of your life into one of these experiments,” said Thomas. “And it’s sitting there on top of a controlled explosion. So yeah, that’s nerve-wracking.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a37c4e386921979c7321ac8f8723f9088acd7d19/703_844_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bb74d91e525b72a12898d25bdf87ad2","title":"clare connor nathan leamon frame ecb new director of cricket","story":"• Head of women’s game and lead analyst have impressed• Andrew Strauss to assist in search for his successorThe search for the new director of England cricket officially starts on Friday with Clare Connor, head of the women’s game, and Nathan Leamon, the national team’s lead analyst, two of the more eye-catching names said to be in contention.Andrew Strauss called time on a three-year spell in charge of the England men’s teams this month as his wife, Ruth, continues her treatment for cancer. But the former captain will continue to work on ad hoc consultancy projects, including the search for his successor alongside Tom Harrison, the ECB chief executive, and the head-hunting firm SRI.The role will be advertised on Friday and while a number of title-winning county directors will doubtless be in the frame – including Surrey’s Alec Stewart, Yorkshire’s Martyn Moxon, Ashley Giles at Warwickshire and Angus Fraser of Middlesex – past experience of playing in men’s professional cricket will be listed as desirable rather than mandatory.This will therefore see the field open up. Connor, a former England captain, has been in charge of the women’s game since 2007 and, having overseen last summer’s World Cup win and been central to plans for the ECB’s new 100‑ball competition that starts in 2020, is considered a strong candidate by the hierarchy.Connor considered applying for the position when it was vacant in 2013 after encouragement from senior ECB figures. With her domestic partner, Andy Flower, yet to decide whether to apply, despite stepping in for Strauss on a temporary basis this year, Connor could now to be set to take this previous interest further.Leamon is another potential candidate who did not play professionally in the men’s game but has the requisite of working at the elite level. The Cambridge mathematics graduate has been lead analyst for the national team since 2009 and like Connor is also highly thought of by the England setup.As was the case previously, the position oversees all performance aspects pertaining to the England men’s team and in the first year will include the recruitment of a new head coach. Trevor Bayliss, hired by Strauss in 2015, has already stated he will not renewing his contract after next year’s World Cup and Ashes home summer.As well as continuing the work of Strauss as regards the overseeing the culture of the national side, the position is understood to place a greater emphasis on long-term strategy, scheduling and liaising with the county game, and helping to implement the new domestic structure from 2020 to 2024, which includes The Hundred.England are looking to have the successful candidate in place before the senior side’s tour to the Caribbean in January. Flower, the former head coach, will remain in charge until then, a spell that includes the disciplinary hearing facing Ben Stokes and Alex Hales in December following last year’s incident in Bristol."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84fcd2997ce6034a55c25324de0eff3a35ced7bc/0_27_3903_2343/master/3903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa45afafc458715599da7a00d0f4517f","title":"rugby union nfl christian wade wasps premiership","story":"Christian Wade appears set for a remarkable career change to American football after it emerged he is leaving Wasps to pursue a future in the NFL on Thursday nightlast night.The 27-year-old winger has 82 Premiership tries to his name, placing him third on the all time list, but is reportedly the latest rugby union player to attempt to make the transition to NFL. Alex Gray, who captained Wade at under-20 level at the Junior World Cup in 2011, has made the switch to Atlanta Falcons while Christian Scotland-Williamson has done likewise from Worcester Warriors to the Pittsburgh Steelers.Wade’s move however, is a bolt from the blue and he is now the highest profile player to attempt to make the transition.

But despite their obvious superiority over the home side the team may be tweaked regardless.Tomorrow’s fourth one-day international is at the same venue (a day game that should hopefully produce more cricket before any afternoon storms) and England are pondering whether to use Denly’s leg-spin or the left-arm medium of Sam Curran given the surface they encountered in midweek.The new-ball pairing of Chris Woakes and Olly Stone – central to the victory in Dambulla – proved easier to score off in Sri Lanka’s 150 for nine, both going at eight or more an over, while the spinners and those with more variations at their disposal offered Morgan greater control and wicket-taking threat.Tom Curran, granted his first appearance since March after Liam Dawson’s tour-ending side injury, picked up three for 17 by varying his speeds masterfully and Adil Rashid overcame a greasy ball for figures of four for 36 Ben Stokes, though wicketless, also mixed it up for an economy rate of five an over.While the younger Curran appeared to have the edge two days out, Rashid’s success means Denly should not be discounted for what would be a 10th ODI cap but a first for nine years.Though a batsman primarily, the 32-year-old’s bowling has improved considerably and he arrives fresh from his all-round performances for Kent in the summer, for which he landed four awards at the Professional Cricketers’ Association’s end-of-season bash. Indeed Denly insists the aim now is to become known as a genuine all-rounder. After arriving at the team hotel in Kandy on Wedneaday, one of the first team-mates he bumped into was Moeen Ali, who has risen from part-timer to mainstay of the bowling attack.“We used to play England Under‑19s together and we used to take the mick out of each other’s bowling,” said Denly. “We were both batters back then. We used to roll our arms over in the nets – I thought I was better than Mo, he thought he was better than me.“It is funny how things have changed. He has gone on and played over 50 Tests and God knows how many one-dayers and T20s, taken lots of wickets and is a genuine all-rounder – probably one of the best in the world. He is certainly an inspiration not just for me but for a lot of people, I am sure. He is a fantastic cricketer.”Denly’s arrival comes 10 days earlier than expected, having originally been named in the Test squad only, despite the white-ball formats being his most profitable of late. Were he to crack this England one-day team – no mean feat given the resources – it would likely see him down the order, a far cry from his role at Kent where in both the Royal London Cup and the T20 Blast the right-hander has been an aggressive opener.Second oldest in the squad after Liam Plunkett, who has also joined the trip but may be held back a little longer, Denly also looks a sound bet to impress his teammates in their all-important football warm-ups given he was once on Charlton Athletic’s books.It was during his first spell with England in 2009 that a tackle delivered by Owais Shah on Denly led to a knee injury and saw the pre-training ritual outlawed for a spell. “I’ve heard a lot about that,” he said. “A few of the lads said I ruined their football – the best part of the day. Thankfully it is back in now and hopefully no more injuries. I have got a good scoring record with Kent so hopefully I can continue that with England.”Asked if his call-up was proof players should never give up, Denly added: “I suppose so. I am only 32 and feel that my best years are still ahead of me. I have never given up on the dream of playing for England again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4b9982450498bffc28acea3b7420dc3bd7521c4/0_78_2249_1349/master/2249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ceb8ed93bdc3eb8ee7812b9d9586b2fc","title":"the lifespan of a fact review daniel radcliffes broadway","story":"An intriguing premise and a confident assemblage of ideas fall apart onstage despite a trio of strong performancesFact: Life of a Fact is one of the three best new plays open on Broadway. Fact: it is early in the season only three new plays are open. Facts, as the show seems to insist, are tricky things. Do we insist on scrupulous accuracy if that accuracy effaces larger truths? Can we call a thing true if we’ve massaged data to get there? Is truth an absolute anyway? Well, at least it’s nice to see Daniel Radcliffe on Broadway again. Fact.This slim, untrusty play, stranded in Studio 54 and credited to Jeremy Kareken, David Murrell and Gordon Farrell, has its roots in some nicely oddball source material. In 2003, the writer John D’Agata submitted an essay to Harper’s about a teen’s suicide in Las Vegas that Harper’s ultimately rejected because of factual inaccuracies. The Believer requested it and assigned an intern, Jim Fingal, to check it. He took to the job with all the fierce resolve of a pit bull clamping down on a chicken leg. It’s unclear how many years – years! – the fact-checking took, but the essay, What Happens There, wasn’t published until 2010. In 2012, the men published the book Life of a Fact, which includes the essay and their arguments.The play tries not to favor either man. Jim (Radcliffe), an intern at an unnamed magazine, is a newbie and a nerd. His dedication is admirable, but he has no ability to distinguish between which facts that might be important and which might not. John (Bobby Cannavale), a reasonably famous essayist, is a blowhard and a bully. Still, craft matters to him, and the play suggests that he is driven by wounds a tech-geek like Jim has never felt. Jim is a calculator. John is a poet. Their referee is Cherry Jones’s semi-fearsome editor Emily. The actors are all elating – Cannavale especially – so if you need a reason to see it, here you go.But the show, directed fleetly by Leigh Silverman, is all John. Ninety minutes long, it plays very fast and very loose with the actual circumstances. Like John it will tell you that its fabrications are in the name of art. Or Broadway. The writers have had to gin up risk and suspense, so in this version, the fact-checking is a rush job, meant to replace a piece on congressional spouses. Jim has to finish it by Monday morning, otherwise it’s back to the spouses! And while Jim toils, people are being paid overtime! Overtime! The humanity!The tension feels fake. So does the play’s vision of journalism. Emily, an invented character, tells Jim: “I think it’s wonderful that you have standards. Just as long as you understand the compromises we have to often make between material that pushes the envelope –”“And the stuff that sells magazines,” Jim concludes. “Absolutely. And ads.“These are the kinds of dumbed down generalizations you might use in a barn like Studio 54 when you don’t trust your audience, not in some private office at Harper’s and certainly not at the Believer.It’s terrific that a play wants to attack such intricate, thorny issues of art and authenticity, but less terrific that it wants to confront them in such phony ways. And to give too much space to D’Agata’s arguments, that facts don’t really matter, that objectivity is flimsy, that as he writes in the book if something “is believed by somebody”, he writes, “I consider it a legitimate potential history” just feels icky and enabling.We’re living through an era in which alternate facts – read, lies – have caused actual and deliberate harm. Theater is of course itself an alternative fact. We know it’s fake. We accept it. That’s a lot of the fun. And yet we can still demand more truth than this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02d6f407e82051fae48fab0f262c9b0895b9cad7/0_313_4433_2659/master/4433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b7b0d887cd7781520952e9645402a7b","title":"wise children review emma rice angela carter old vic london","story":"Old Vic, LondonRazzle-dazzle showbiz twins bewitch and delight in an inventive, smart and saucy productionWise Children is Angela Carter’s rambunctious last novel about illegitimacy, incest and Shakespearean illusion. It is also the name of Emma Rice’s new theatre company, which launches with this adaptation. Carter would surely have approved of such doubleness and reinvention her work is filled with twins and revisionist retellings of old stories.Dora and Nora – the central twins of Carter’s book – are Brixton-born septuagenarians, looking back on their lives as showgirls in the tawdry music halls of 1930s London. Here, they are represented by puppets, as their youngest incarnations, and by three couples: cartwheeling girls in pigtails (Omari Douglas and Mirabelle Gremaud), Amazonian showgirls with Louise Brooks bobs (Melissa James and Bettrys Jones), and the 75-year-old dual storytellers (Etta Murfitt and Gareth Snook), narrating their life stories with the cockney bonhomie of old-school entertainers.Both Murfitt and Snook are almost always on stage, often alongside their younger counterparts. Their simultaneous presence reflects how past selves cast shadows on the present. More importantly, this multiplicity draws our eye to theatrical artifice, a recurring theme in Carter’s book. Rice’s Wise Children, which sits inventively somewhere between musical and play, is as much about performance as it is about the lives of the twins.Their story emerges through flashbacks, cabaret acts and skits. The music-hall scenes keep faithful to the period, but there are a few cheeky slips into the popular culture of the 80s (the story is set in 1989) with a high-energy rendition of Eddy Grant’s Electric Avenue and a folksy version of Cyndi Lauper’s Girls Just Want to Have Fun. Vicki Mortimer’s set exposes the mechanics of the staging in the most bewitching of ways and the cast retain a self-conscious sense of performance, too. The twins’ grandmother, played by Katy Owen, steals the show with saucy double entendres and fantastic physical comedy. They play their parts as if they are cabaret or pantomime performers, at pains never to become too real or human. The most emotionally wrenching moments (when the teenage twins are rejected by their father or when the grandmother dies) are never lingered on for long, and even in these moments there is a hint of comic burlesque.The production expertly draws out the Shakespearean part of the story. Carter wrote of Shakespeare as the “great popular entertainer of all time” and felt his legacy had been misappropriated as a bastion of high culture. She creates a fabulous parody of the “thesp” in the mincing figure of the twins’ father, Peregrine, and Shakespearean lines are dropped in like irreverent music-hall punchlines.The bawdy humour is there, too, along with the gender-swapping. A male lover is played by a woman with a drawn-on moustache and lowered voice the old, cross-dressed Dora quips: “It’s every woman’s tragedy that, after a certain age, she looks like a female impersonator.” Rice captures perfectly Carter’s notion of gender as a playful, fluid performance.It is a spectacular show, distilling the carnivalesque spirit of the book yet managing to control its many unruly parts and surfeit of imagination. Rice’s relaunch is a splashy one, celebrating the sheer razzle-dazzle of a life in theatre.• Wise Children is at the Old Vic, London, until 10 November.

Amazon is making room for 180 new roles in Cambridge.Amazon’s rapid global growth has spurred it to hire thousands of workers in Britain in recent years, most of whom are based at its warehouses.The company this month responded to criticism of poor pay and conditions for its warehouse workers with the announcement of a pay rise to £10.50 an hour in London and £9.50 across the rest of the country.However, it later emerged that the company had slashed share bonuses for those workers, offsetting at least half of the pay rise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb8423ef0eda6f5e4133c219917a46285254d6e1/1_0_4394_2638/master/4394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2732af3f95d5301d8ea3abe5f31e0a5e","title":"google pixel 3 review android performance camera design","story":"New phone reaches Apple-level of polish, with top-notch performance, fantastic camera and attractive designThe Pixel 3 is Google’s third stab at making its own top-end phone, attempting to outshine the likes of Apple and Samsung with a terrific camera and a highly polished experience.The Pixel 3 is the smaller of the two new Google phones, with a 5.5in FHD+ OLED screen that is bright, crisp and vibrant. It is a beautiful display that is a significant step up from last year’s Pixel 2, with wide viewing angles with minimal colour shift.The Pixel 3 mirrors the design of last year’s Pixel 2 XL with a relatively large chin and forehead containing stereo speakers and various cameras. It’s fairly small by modern standards, making it easy to handle and pocket, similar to the Pixel 2, Apple’s iPhone XS and the Samsung Galaxy S9. It’s also light at 148g compared to the 177g iPhone XS and 168g Galaxy S9, both of which have slightly larger 5.8in screens.Gone is last year’s coated aluminium back, replaced with two-tone glass. The frosted bit is etched glass, which is super smooth, but is surrounded by polished glass and coated metal sides that aid your grip. The combination feels wonderfully smooth and luxurious in the hand. This is a phone you will want to fondle.In the centre of the back below the glossy panel is a fingerprint scanner as good last year’s. There are no other biometric security options, such as face unlock, despite the Pixel 3 having two front-facing cameras.The bottom of the phone has a USB-C port and a sim tray, while the right side volume button is joined by a mint green power button. There’s no headphone socket to be seen, but the camera only sticks out the back less than 1mm.The Pixel 3 has Qualcomm’s current top-of-the-line processor, the Snapdragon 845, as used in the OnePlus 6 and most other current flagship smartphones, with the exception of the UK versions of Samsung’s S9 and Note 9 and Huawei’s phones, both of which use their own-brand chips.The Pixel 3 only has 4GB of RAM, compared with 6GB or even 8GB in some top-end Android competitors. While it might lose in a game of Top Trumps, it’s not noticeable in daily use because the Pixel 3 is so buttery smooth in operation, with top-notch gaming performance too.The whole system, from switching apps to pulling up the camera, has a level of polish only matched by Apple’s iOS on the iPhone XS. It’s not quite as brutally rapid as the OnePlus 6 in operation, simply because the animations play out for longer, but it’s easily faster and slicker than any other Android device.Battery life for the Pixel 3 is a moving target. Normally smartphones stabilise to a fairly consistent level after a couple of days of first starting them up.That was with consistent use as my primary device sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music with Spotify on Bluetooth headphones, watching 30 minutes of Netflix and shooting about 10 photos a day.Part of that is undoubtedly down to the Adaptive Battery technology in Android 9 Pie that learns your usage pattern and limits power to apps you don’t really use. It’s possible that over the next couple of weeks battery life may continue to improve, although it is unlikely to be by vast amounts.A full charge via the included 18w fast charger took 101 minutes. The Pixel 3 can also charge wirelessly at up to 10w, which is a little slower than via cable but still faster than some phones charge from their bundled chargers.The Pixel 3 runs the latest version of Android 9 Pie, which makes it one of only handful of phones to do so.The main advantages of Pie over previous versions are better notification handling, particularly around do not disturb (DND) modes, wellbeing tool integration for tracking usage and modes to deter usage, such as Wind Down, and great integration of AI systems.Exclusive to the Pixel 3 is Google’s smart compose for Gmail, which takes the advanced autocomplete you might have used in Gmail in the browser on desktop to the Gmail app on the phone. It’s scarily good at writing emails.Google has also removed the traditional home and overview navigation buttons, replacing them by a pill-shaped gesture button in the middle and a small back arrow to the left.The back button still does what you’d expect, but the gesture button does a number of things. Tap it to go home, tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant, flick it upwards once to get to the app switcher or twice to get to the app drawer (you can also go straight to the app drawer by dragging it further up the screen).Dragging the gesture button to the right turns it into a slider flicking between recently used apps as you move your finger across the bar. Flicking the button to the right switches straight to the last used app in the same way a double-tap on the overview button used to.It works fine, but there is a bit of getting used to and I don’t think it’s actually faster than the previous navigation buttons. It also isn’t as smooth and intuitive as Apple’s gesture bar system introduced with the iPhone X, or some other gesture systems used by the likes of OnePlus or Huawei.It is safe to say the Pixel 3 has one of the best, if not the best cameras available today.The rear 12-megapixel camera is capable of capturing stunning images, rich in detail, vibrancy and dynamic range. It is better than any other at bringing out detail and colour from high-contrast scenes where there are a mix of bright lights and dark corners thanks to Google’s HDR+ algorithms.Low light performance is also fantastic, and that’s before the promised Night Sight mode that will come in a software update soon, which Google says will be able to produce dramatically better night-time shots.What sets the Pixel 3 apart from the competition is that it can do all this with practically no user skill whatsoever – this is the point-and-shoot that will make you look like you know what you’re doing even if you don’t.Google’s Top Shot works as advertised, using on-device AI to discern if one of the many frames it captures before and after you hit the shutter button is better than your attempt, for when someone blinks or cuts across your field of view.Likewise, Super Res Zoom is far better than standard digital zoom, but can’t quite match the clarity of Apple’s hybrid zoom using the iPhone XS’s 2x telephoto lens at extended zooms.Two selfie cameras adorn the front: a standard 8-megapixel camera joined but a wide-angle fixed focus camera allowing you to zoom out one step. At normal zoom levels the camera captures a stunning amount of detail even in crummy lighting conditions – if you have flaws in your skin this camera will capture them in all their glory.The wide-angle selfie helps you fit more people in, but the images it captured aren’t quite as good.Portrait mode for both front and rear cameras has been improved, particularly around hair, and now with the ability adjust blur both in the background and foreground after the fact. The motion autofocus is also magic, making macro shots a lot easier – tap on an object and the focus follows it around.The Google Pixel 3 is available for £739 with 64GB of storage or £839 with 128GB of storage, in a choice of black, white or pink.The Pixel 3 can be summed up in one word: refinement.Every element of Android 9 Pie is slick and responsive. It’s simple to use but powerful in its execution. From the simply brilliant camera to the auto-complete in Gmail, on-device AI proves truly useful. Plus you get at least three years of software updates, which is still a rarity outside of Apple’s iPhone.The outside of the phone feels luxurious, but in a different way to the iPhone XS. The way the etched glass blends into the polished glass and body looks and feels beautiful.Inside and out the Pixel 3 is more polished than any other Android smartphone, fully justifying Google’s entry into the big leagues.It’s not perfect, of course the battery life could certainly do with being longer, and a glass back will be less durable than metal. There’s also no face unlocking and the relatively large chin and forehead will look dated in a year or so.But there’s absolutely no doubt that if you don’t want a £999 iPhone XS, the Pixel 3 is the best small smartphone going.Pros: super smooth and fluid performance, great screen, squeezable sides, Android 9 Pie and 3 years of updates, water resistant, fantastic camera, wireless chargingCons: relatively large chin and forehead, no expandable storage or removable battery, no headphone jack, battery life could be better, no face recognition"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d236ef4a83c825f8a4a6aa02857f2242c5bb5792/0_284_4642_2786/master/4642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dcb46490d348d4ffb689b8a038b2fe6","title":"global inequalities make the internet overwhelmingly male","story":"Lack of education and unpaid care work among reasons women trail men onlineTo understand why is to see inequalities collide. Globally, women have less access to education and less chance of entering the jobs market, where they will typically earn a quarter less than their male colleagues. It is no surprise that when asked about barriers to being online, not knowing how and not being able to afford it, come up time and again.To attract customers, telecoms firms in Africa offer deals that bundle in sports TV shows, which are more likely to appeal to men than women.It is not only cost and knowhow that drives the digital gender gap. Women do more unpaid care work than men, and so have less free time. In one survey conducted by the Web Foundation, a common remark from women in 10 developing countries was that going online was simply not worthwhile.Another force at work has its roots in patriarchal societies where technology, and the wider online world, are seen as male preserves. A survey of men in New Delhi, India, and Manila, the Philippines, found that half believed men should be able to restrict what women do online, while two thirds agreed that women should not use the internet in public spaces, such as cybercafes. Such places are dominated by men, but an intimidating atmosphere is not the only deterrent.“When people build cybercafes, there’s a fundamental flaw in design,” says Nanjira Sambuli, a senior policy manager at the Web Foundation. “They assume they are safe places for women to walk to, but often they are not. Then, if they open from nine to five, that doesn’t factor in that women are probably caring for children or trying to do another job. They end up being left behind.”There is also harassment. Misogyny is rife on the internet. A 2014 survey by the Pew Research Center in Washington DC found that a quarter of young women had been the target of online sexual harassment, and more had been stalked online. In Nairobi, Kenya, and Kampala, Uganda, women report extremely high rates of online harassment. The two cities have some of the lowest rates of women online in the world.Some countries do buck the trend. Where men and women are equally likely to go to university, or where women make up the majority of the university population, the digital gender gap is erased or reversed.In Jamaica, more women are online than men – a reflection, perhaps, of the long-standing dominance of women at the University of the West Indies in Kingston."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f204534e2292bddc3c5e3f9a03d21330738f9740/0_161_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7a9aa96afbacac1b95a51199d549e25","title":"california life sentences three strikes","story":"Under controversial three-strikes law, people who commit three felonies can be jailed for 25 years even if third offence is minorCalifornia will reconsider life sentences for up to 4,000 non-violent third-strike criminals by allowing them to seek parole under a ballot measure approved by voters two years ago, according to court documents obtained by the Associated Press.The state will craft new regulations by January to include the repeat offenders in early release provisions.The state parole board estimates between 3,000 and 4,000 non-violent third-strikers could be affected, said a corrections department spokeswoman, Vicky Waters, “but they would have to go through rigorous public safety screenings and a parole board hearing before any decision is made”.Under California’s controversial three strikes law, people who commit three felonies can be jailed for 25 years even if the third offence is considered minor.Last month, a three-judge appellate panel in the second appellate district in a Los Angeles county case ruled that third-strikers must be included under Proposition 57’s constitutional amendment. It requires parole consideration for “any person convicted of a nonviolent felony offense” regardless of enhancements under California’s three strikes law.Governor Jerry Brown, who leaves office in January, will not appeal.Administration lawyers said in a filing in a separate related case that the state “is not seeking review” of the appeals court decision and “is in the process of drafting new emergency regulations in compliance” with the decision by 5 January.Michael Romano, director of the Stanford Three Strikes Project, called the administration’s decision to comply “a big deal, a huge deal”.Clients potentially affected by the new decision include inmates serving life terms for stealing a bicycle, possessing less than half a gram of methamphetamine, stealing two bottles of liquor or shoplifting shampoo, he said.“It’s a monumental decision. It’s one of the biggest decisions on sentencing policy in the Brown administration,” said Romano, whose project represented third-strike inmates in several appeals.The ruling does not guarantee any of the offenders will get out of jail. But it allows them to go before the parole board. Romano estimates 4,000 people will be eligible for parole.Non-violent third-strikers are disproportionately black, disproportionately mentally ill and statistically among the least likely to commit additional crimes, said Romano, who has studied the issue.Another judge ruled in February that the state must consider earlier parole for potentially thousands of sex offenders. The administration is fighting that ruling, which undercuts repeated promises that Brown made to voters to exclude sex offenders from earlier release. staff contributed to this article"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ea84334ceb6147760ca462eeda5dcf87fa2b160/0_978_2448_1469/master/2448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=984bcdab72ebaa674c23fc274a49ccc2","title":"sotol alcohol drink mexico juarez","story":"Sotol has re-emerged in Mexico and across the border thanks to growing interest in authentic and ethically sourced spiritsWhen the US banned alcohol production and importation in 1920, spirits from Mexico began illegally crossing the border. Alongside mass quantities of tequila was the lesser-known sotol: a north Mexican moonshine with a similar flavor profile.“We exported 300,000 liters during prohibition,” said Ricardo Pico, of the Chihuahua-based distillery Sotol Clande, who has spent years studying the drink. After prohibition, Pico said, the Mexican government – protecting the interests of large alcohol companies – embarked on a campaign to paint sotol as an unrefined peasant drink. Mexico criminalized the production of sotol, destroyed distilleries and imprisoned maestro sotol makers.While the tequila industry surged, clandestine sotol operations continued in Mexico, with ranchers and farmers harvesting the sotol plant, fire-roasting it, then fermenting, distilling and ageing the final product for local consumption. For decades, sotol remained a local specialty with little exposure to the outside world.That may be changing. Nearly a century after prohibition began, sotol has re-emerged within the US market, growing steadily over the past decade. A few years ago, just one brand was available in the US today there are 10. Like Mezcal before it, sotol has capitalized on the growing interest in authentic, hyperlocal and ethically sourced spirits. “Products with a story,” said Pico, whose company is a cooperative supporting five small producers in rural Mexico.“They are artists more than distillers. They are making irreplaceable batches based of centuries of knowledge. That is what consumers want,” said Pico, noting that Mexico finally legalized the drink in the 1980s.It’s “something that can only be made here”, said Ariana De León of Sotol Cinco Tragos, the only female-run sotol business located near Juarez. “This is Juarez in a bottle. A taste of our history.”That history stretches back millennia. In pre-Columbian times, Native Americans in northern Mexico and the south-western US began making alcohol out of the sotol plant by harvesting and fermenting one of the 16 varietals of sotol (also known as desert spoon), which resembles a cross between agave and yucca.When the Spanish introduced stills, this new technology was incorporated and the modern spirit was born, cementing itself in the culture of northern Mexico.“Infusions have been part of the story of sotol for a while,” said Pico. The drink’s flavor and character is rooted in the the lands of northern Mexico.“Sotol is a deeply complex and very transparent plant,” said Pico, explaining how the range of flavors in the sotol spirit directly reflects the land in which the plant is grown. “Desert sotol is very herbal, earthy and minerally. Forest sotol is greener, with flavors of moss, bark, truffle and pine.”While sotol has seen a rise in popularity, with dozens of makers emerging in the past 10 years, it was long absent from the mainstream drinking culture in the US and Mexico. “Younger generations of Mexicans were only interested in scotch and tequila,” said Pico, who previously worked for Hacienda de Chihuahua, the largest sotol company in Mexico.Today that is changing. On the busy Avenida Benito Juarez, just over the bridge from El Paso, a line of bars stretch south toward Juarez’s city plaza. Just a few years ago sotol was elusive here. Now it’s everywhere, with numerous bars and liquor stores catering to foreigners and locals.“It’s buzzing,” said Ricardo Hatfield, the owner of La Esquina De Chihuas in Juarez. “Six months ago we had no sotols. Now we sell a variety. It’s got that hipster feel.”“People are looking for something better than shit tequila,” said Mike Morales, the executive editor of TequilaAficionado and one of the most prominent tequila journalists in the US. “I have said that when tequila drops the ball, sotol will be next.”For De León, the potential of sotol as force for good is clear. A few years back, her company broke ground on a huge tourism complex centered around sotol. The building, which is nearly completed, will include multiple event spaces, a distillery, tasting room, restaurant, offices and even a sotol museum.“We’re not just making sotol,” said De León, standing in the U-shaped warehouse that dominates the otherwise sparse landscape outside Juarez. “We’re making a cultural project for Juarez to help our city and state.”“It’s a lot about economic and community development,” said Pico. “Ideally what we want to achieve is to make Chihuahua a tourist destination for sotol.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a894376271ab3c6a733757726cb03dcbf59b193/0_342_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4aee26ae74ff1991c55f4a8b60e89c5c","title":"adults in the room greens surge across europe as centre left flounders","story":"Movement increasingly appeals to voters frustrated with traditional mainstream partiesThe elections in three countries last weekend suggest that as Europe’s historic mainstream parties plummet in the polls and struggle to see off the far right’s challenge, for liberal-minded voters the Greens look like an answer.Offering a pro-EU stance, a humane approach to migration and clear positions on issues such as climate change, bioersity and sustainability, Green parties in several countries are now polling higher nationally than the traditional centre-left.“They represent a clear place where people can go who are frustrated with the traditional mainstream parties but who don’t like the far right,” said Alexander Clarkson, a lecturer in European studies at King’s College London.“They offer a very clear counter-model to the positions and arguments of parties like Germany’s AfD. Also they’ve been around for a while now, more than 40 years, and they’ve governed responsibly both locally and regionally. They kind of look like the adults in the room.”Green parties score particularly highly among professional, often young, relatively affluent and generally urban voters, analysts say. “If you look at the demographics, many are what you’d once have called typical lefty voters,” said Jon Worth, a candidate for the German Green party in next year’s European elections.“They have a young, energetic leadership and a different style of doing politics – straight-talking, acknowledging the limits of what can and can’t be done … A mix of ideology and pragmatism that puts inidual, everyday choices at the heart of politics again. There’s no real comms strategy, no spin.”Growing environmental awareness among many voters is also plainly a factor. After a summer of record-breaking temperatures across Europe during which wildfires blazed in the Arctic, it is hardly surprising that a movement that since the 1980s has warned of the dangers of climate change is winning greater support.But if the Green wave has come mainly at the expense of traditional centre-left social democratic parties, whose support has plunged across Europe to the point of near wipeout in countries such as France and the Netherlands, the movement also increasingly appeals to substantial numbers of disillusioned centre-right voters.The rise of the far right has shifted national debates, dragging the rhetoric of many mainstream conservative parties – particularly on immigration – further and further to the right and alienating their more liberal-minded voters.In Bavaria’s state election, the centre-left SPD lost 210,000 voters to the Greens. But the ecologists gained very nearly as many – 180,000 – from the centre-right CSU, which had tacked sharply to the right in an attempt to win back votes from the far-right AfD.Perhaps crucially, although the German Greens were in government as junior partners in Gerhardt Schröder’s Social Democrat-led coalition from 1998 to 2005, few European Green parties have governed nationally since the 2008 financial crash.“They have not had to take the big national decisions around austerity, have not been sullied in the same way as the main centre-right and centre-left parties that are so implicated in the aftermath of that crisis,” said Fabien Escalona, a French political scientist at Sciences Po Grenoble.Escalona also noted that Green parties appeared to be doing particularly well in relatively prosperous countries, where the effects of austerity had not been felt so severely but where migration had become a major political issue. Elsewhere, a more radical left was more popular, he said.Europe’s Greens have experienced similar polling surges, most recently after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. But analysts suggest there is a long-term trend away from the traditional right-versus-left, socio-economic view of politics.The German Greens’ slogan in Bavaria was “Rather than spread fear, give courage,” a message that the movement sees as key to its growth and vital to counter what the party’s co-leader Robert Habeck calls the “brutalisation” of political discourse.“We believe the only way of answering that is to not let ourselves be governed by fear of making mistakes or fear of the far right,” he said.Monica Frassoni, co-chair of the European Green party, said the results showed success could be won “by putting hope over fear, and compassion over hate”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e1fd8df763aa3501c840ee9d0f6301531ba2ad3/335_468_3665_2199/master/3665.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=addc4c3a7df8600bc14a64cf8d54b7f9","title":"friday briefing khashoggi search moves to forest","story":"Boycott of Saudi summit grows … Theresa May’s transition blues … and BepiColombo spacecraft heads for Mercury Greetings, I’m Warren Murray with a selection of news in a presentation box.The search for Jamal Khashoggi’s remains has extended to forest and farmland outside the Turkish capital, Ankara. Investigators in Turkey are said to have used CCTV footage from around the city to determine that vehicles owned by the Saudi Arabian consulate travelled to the Belgrad area in Yalova province late on 2 October, the day the US-based Saudi Arabian dissident journalist vanished. In Istanbul, gardens have been dug up and floodlights and a drone deployed in the search of the Saudi consul general’s residence.The US president, Donald Trump, said there would have to be “very severe” consequences if suspicions proved correct that Khashoggi was murdered at the hands of the Saudis. Trump has been heavily criticised for making the US trade and security relationship with Saudi Arabia his priority, rather than justice over Khashoggi’s disappearance. Asked if he thought the Saudi exile was dead, the president told reporters: “It certainly looks that way to me. It’s very sad. It certainly looks that way.”Liam Fox, the UK trade secretary, and the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have joined key European partners in pulling out of a major economic forum in Saudi Arabia nicknamed Davos in the desert, in response to the alleged murder.But back to Trump – Some redemption there for the president in the eyes of the world, perhaps, but shortlived it proved to be after he last night whipped up a crowd into laughing and cheering about an attack on another journalist,  US political reporter Ben Jacobs. “Any guy that can do a body slam … he’s my guy,” said Trump, referring to Greg Gianforte, the Montana politician who physically attacked Jacobs for asking questions he didn’t like.The president has now openly and directly praised a violent act against a journalist on American soil, at a time when his administration is crucial to ensuring justice is done in the Khashoggi case. Gianforte pleaded guilty to a charge of misdemeanour assault and was sentenced to four days in jail, converted to community service, a fine and anger management training.Lost in transition – EU leaders might be making hopeful noises about forming a “coalition of the reasonable” to help Theresa May conclude a Brexit deal. But the PM has come under fire from both hardline leavers and remainers in her party after she foreshadowed extending the post-Brexit transition period. Donald Tusk, the European council president, and other EU leaders probably didn’t help May’s as she heads back from Brussels. They indicated they would wave through any request by the UK for a transition longer than the planned 21 months. The outspoken Conservative backbencher Johnny Mercer has called the current government a “shitshow” and said right now he would not vote for the party if he was not one of its MPs.‘Drug dealers’ blamed for killing – A man who died after a fight in Battersea, south London, may have been trying to see off drug dealers, his father has said. Scotland Yard launched a murder investigation after Ian Tomlin, 46, was found fatally beaten on Wednesday night near the flats where he lived. “There were always drug dealers hanging outside his home smoking – he told them to move on because his kids live there,” Tomlin’s 84-year-old father, Cecil, told the Evening Standard. Neighbours said buyers would ring all residents’ buzzers at night to get into a dealer’s flat. “He was not a violent person but he always wanted to protect his kids,” one resident said in the .New scare for Taser victim – A police force that shot its own race relations adviser with a stun gun in 2017 after mistaking him for a wanted man has either once again confused him for the very same person – or, as he put it, some of its officers decided to callously “wind him up”. Judah Adunbi, a Rastafarian known as Ras Judah, said a police car pulled up alongside him in Bristol and two officers repeatedly taunted him with the name Royston McCalla. Six weeks ago the Avon and Somerset chief constable expressed regret about police shooting Adunbi in the face with a stun gun in 2017 after thinking he was McCalla. Adunbi said that in this latest encounter the police clearly knew who he was and were giggling about it. “I felt terrible. I walked home and locked my door and didn’t want to go back out.” The force said its officers drove off once they were “able to establish the man wasn’t the wanted suspect … We fully accept the man the officers spoke to wasn’t the man we’re trying to trace.”Once it goes into orbit, the European Space Agency-built Mercury Transfer Module will release Japan’s Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter and Europe’s Mercury Planetary Orbiter.

Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Yves HermanReutersIf there’s one man who enjoys a European summit, it’s Nigel Farage MEP, erstwhile leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (Ukip), and The Man Who Made Brexit. Farage is in his element over here, conducting an unending series of interviews in the cavernous five-storey atrium of the Justus Lipsius building, temporary home to the several hundred visiting journalists.He flits from camera to camera, microphone to microphone, dispensing his signature brand of wit, bluster, triumphalism and warnings to “get on with it, Mrs May!” to a dizzying array of interviewers, foreign and domestic. During lulls in media engagements, he stands at the entrance to the hall, inviting further attention – which arrives, inevitably, before much time has elapsed. On Thursday he was also being followed about by a dedicated television crew who seemed to be filming a day in the life of Nigel, or something. (Watch out for it.) Nigel’s TV crew spend the morning filming him being filmed by his interviewers. His only break from constant media duty is an intermittent dash to the smoking cabin for gaspers and muttered confidences to his Irish confidante, sidekick and media booker, Hermann Kelly, who is also, as it happens, the mainstay of the Irexit movement. The best you can say of that is that it is an idea whose time has not yet come.You feel that he’s going to miss all this, is Nigel. There was a poignant moment on Wednesday, when he arrived at the summit venue only to be refused access by security, due to a mix-up, wilful or otherwise. Security is ever-present at the summit, with the 4,000-5,000 attendees – staff, diplomats, journalists, officials, hangers-on, Nigel, Hermann, all the greats – subjected to security vetting, airport scanners and long stares from gentlemen with earpieces and short haircuts. They gave Nigel an especially long stare and told him his papers were not in order.“Fifteen years I’ve been coming and it’s never happened before,” an outraged Nigel told reporters. “I’m hardly a security risk.” You’d have to have a heart of stone not to laugh.But there’s another chap in Brussels who loves summits as much as Nigel. Far away from the being hounded in the Dáil by Micheál Martin, or pestered by Shane Ross in the Cabinet room, Leo Varadkar exudes a glow of industry and satisfaction at these meetings of European leaders. This wasn’t just one summit, Varadkar explained at his press conference on Thursday. There were actually several inidual summits: the article 50 summit, the regular meeting of the European Council, the Euro area summit and the Asia-Europe summit. Actually, he left out the tripartite social summit (which preceded everything on Wednesday), and then there’s the Korea-Europe summit. No wonder Varadkar, in his best blue shirt and green tie (green for Ireland, blue for the blueshirts) looked so happy. After the summit dinner, the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the French president Emmanuel Macron, along with the leaders of Belgium and Luxembourg, slipped out for a few beers. (Not the only ones with this idea, it is true.)Asked by a passing drinker how Brexit was going, Merkel replied: “Please, it’s a wonderful evening – let’s not spoil it with that!” They should have invited Nigel. He’d have livened things up. Assuming he could get past the bouncers, that is."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3668460.1539895179!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peter casey denies mixing up michael d higgins and ff mayor","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential candidate Peter Casey visits Cabra Bridge in Co Tipperary on Thursday. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Presidential candidate Peter Casey has denied he made a mistake when he accused President Michael D Higgins of having objected to a Traveller halting site in Galway in 1968.Galway City Council has been unable to shed light on the claim, made during the Virgin Media One presidential debate hosted by Pat Kenny on Wednesday night, despite Mr Casey claiming that the objection was “on the public record”.Mr Ó hUiginn noted that Mr Higgins was not on the council at the time, and he has no recollection of him being involved in what transpired at Rahoon. Both men were at university together, and both served terms as mayor of Galway.Mr Ó hUiginn said the 1968 case was the one and only time he had objected to a halting site, and he had done so as there were concerns about its location next to a cemetery and in what was then a rural area on the outskirts of the city.Mr Higgins was not living in the area at the time, having settled originally on the east side of the city before moving to Circular Road near Rahoon.Galway Corporation’s plans in 1968 for a serviced halting site near Rahoon cemetery resulted in large protests, some of them violent. An  editorial at the time condemned discrimination against Travellers and coined the word “Rahoonery”.A Galway City Council spokesman said that Mr Casey’s reference this week was “too vague”, and also pointed out that Mr Higgins was not an elected member of the local authority at the time.The Galway Traveller Movement has said that Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina have been long-time supporters of Traveller issues, and challenged Mr Casey to provide evidence for his claim.A spokeswoman for Mr Casey said the candidate stood by his claim, insisting that he had not confused names, and that it was “on the public record for journalists to check”.Mr Casey would reveal more details on the day after the presidential election, or if Mr Higgins disclosed full details of his expenses, the spokeswoman said.During Wednesday night’s debate, Mr Kenny had asked candidates if they would like members of the Travelling community to live next door to them.Mr Higgins replied: “Yes, I have a halting site a couple of hundred yards from my house and they are wonderful people.”Mr Casey suggested that Mr Higgins objected to a halting site near his home in 1968. Mr Higgins said that was inaccurate.“I have never objected to a halting site,” Mr Higgins said. “I was an elected representative on Galway city and county council and I often took a stand, unpopularly, on the rights of Travelling people to be offered housing.”In a separate development, the Galway City Community Network and Galway City Partnership have jointly condemned comments made by Independent city councillor Noel Larkin on radio on Thursday morning, in which he defended Mr Casey’s remarks this week on the Travelling community.Galway City Partnership chief executive officer Declan Brassil said the incident was “particularly ironic and disappointing” given that Mr Larkin had signed a statement on human rights and equality which was endorsed by Labour Mayor of Galway Niall McNelis on Wednesday.Mr Casey had claimed Travellers should not be recognised as an ethnic minority because they are “basically people camping in someone else’s land”.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3668431.1539890883!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may says brexit negotiations always likely to get tougher at end","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May  did not deny reports she agreed with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, above,  that the backstop should be temporary but not time-limited. Photograph: Julien WarnandEPABritish prime minister Theresa May has described the European Union’s proposal for a Northern Ireland-only backstop as unacceptable but did not deny reports she agreed with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that the backstop should be temporary but not time-limited. Speaking at the end of an European Council meeting in Brussels, Ms May said Brexit negotiations were always likely to get tougher towards the end and that the two sides were still working through difficult issues.“Crucial among those is this issue of the Northern Ireland backstop and ensuring that we can provide for a solution which is not the solution that was proposed by the European Union initially, which would have effectively carved Northern Ireland away from the rest of the United Kingdom,” she said.“That’s unacceptable to the UK government. I think it would be unacceptable to any UK government. So on that issue further solutions have been put forward. But what we want to do is to work to get through that so we can actually get to the deal that I think will be good for the British people.”After a months-long standoff over the backstop, British sources say EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier’s negotiating taskforce have shown a willingness to engage with Britain’s proposal for a customs backstop that would apply to the whole of the UK. Ms May has angered Conservative Brexiteers by saying she was considering a proposal to extend the post-Brexit transition by a year.Ms May said she was not proposing such an extension but wanted to explore solutions to the issue of the backstop which was blocking progress towards an overall Brexit deal.“What we are doing is working to ensure we have a solution to the backstop issue in Northern Ireland which is currently a blockage to completing the deal that enables us to get on with completing a deal that delivers on the vote of the British people and is good for the future of the UK,” she said.The other 27 leaders decided that insufficient progress had been made in Brexit negotiations to justify convening a special summit next month. But Ms May said they shared her sense of urgency about resolving the outstanding issues, particularly surrounding the backstop.“We are intensifying the work on these issues that remain and we’re very clear. And what I’ve had from leaders around the table over the last hours since I arrived in Brussels yesterday is a very real sense that people want that deal to be done,” she said on Thursday.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But German chancellor Angela Merkel said all possible solutions had already been sounded out and French president Emmanuel Macron said it was up to Britain to find a political solution.Under pressure from within her own party at Westminster, Mrs May played down the proposal to extend the transition period, which is due to end in December 2020. However, she said she was committed to working with the EU to quickly resolve the backstop issue, which was blocking progress towards a Brexit deal.“What we are doing is working to ensure we have a solution to the backstop issue in Northern Ireland, which is currently a blockage to completing the deal, that enables us to get on with completing a deal that delivers on the vote of the British people and is good for the future of the UK,” she said.The other EU leaders decided not to convene a special summit next month to discuss Brexit but they kept open the option of doing so if negotiations make progress, and they decided against calling a “no-deal” summit.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the other leaders understood the domestic political pressures faced by the British prime minister.“There is absolutely an acknowledgement across the European Union – we’re all politicians, we do understand that prime minister May has to get a deal that she can get through Westminster,” he said.Mr Varadkar said his decision to show the leaders at Wednesday’s dinner a copy of that day’s , which carried a story on the bombing of a customs post in 1972, was to illustrate “what used to happen when we had customs posts in Ireland”.Dr Merkel said: “We all need to find an answer on Ireland and Northern Ireland. But if you don’t have an agreement then you don’t have an answer either for Ireland or Northern Ireland.“I think that all of the different avenues have been sounded out quite thoroughly, all of the possibilities.”European Council president Donald Tusk said he felt a solution was closer than before but Mr Macron said the EU could not make further compromises and it was now up to Britain to propose a solution on the backstop.“The EU has already demonstrated our flexibility, but there are limits. We cannot jeopardise the single market, the four fundamental liberties, or Ireland,” he said.“It is no longer a technical issue but one of the political capacity of the UK to find a solution.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Hours earlier, the Dutch and French finance ministers also pulled out. The summit, known formally as the Future Investment Initiative, was the brainchild of Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince now at the centre of an international storm after allegations he ordered Mr Khashoggi’s murder. Leading business figures and media groups are also boycotting the summit along with Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The UK and US pulled out of the summit as Donald Trump acknowledged it certainly looks as though Mr Khashoggi is dead, and he threatened very severe consequences if the Saudis were found to have murdered him.Asked if the journalist was dead, he said: It certainly looks that way. ... Very sad. He did not say on what he based his latest statement about the writer\u0027s likely demise.New images showed Maher Mutreb, a Saudi intelligence officer, outside the consulate several hours before Mr Khashoggi arrivedAsked what consequence Saudi leaders would face if they are found to be responsible, he replied: It will have to be very severe. It\u0027s bad, bad stuff. But we\u0027ll see what happens.Turkish police were searching a forest on the outskirts of Istanbul and a city near the Sea of Marmara for the remains of Khashoggi, two senior Turkish officials told Reuters.Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said Saudi Arabia should be given “a few more days” to provide an explanation for what happened to Mr Khashoggi, who disappeared October 2. Mr Pompeo raised doubt about the strength of any US response by saying the Trump administration has not yet decided “how or if” to act and stressing America’s deep ties with Saudi Arabia.“They are an important strategic alliance to the United States,” he said. He refused to say if he knew whether Mr Khashoggi was alive or dead. Turkish officials say a team of 15 Saudi operatives murdered Mr Khashoggi and dismembered his body inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. They claim to have graphic audio tape, which captures one Saudi operative urging others to listen to music as they carved up Mr Khashoggi’s body with a bone saw. One Turkish report said the Saudis cut off Mr Khashoggi’s fingers before beheading him.Turkey has not shared the audio tape with the US but American officials have requested it, Donald Trump said. Saudi Arabia has vehemently denied responsibility although some reports indicate the Saudi royal family is preparing to blame intelligence officials for the killing in an effort to protect Crown Prince Mohammed.Any effort to claim the crown prince was unaware of the Saudi operation grew more complicated Thursday after Turkish media published CCTV footage showing that a member of his entourage was at the consulate the morning Mr Khashoggi vanished. Mike Pompeo spent two days in Saudi Arabia and TurkeyThe footage showed Maher Mutreb, a Saudi intelligence officer who once worked at the Saudi embassy in London, arriving at the consulate several hours before Mr Khashoggi. Mr Mutreb has been photographed with the crown prince on several recent international visits. A spokesman for Dr Fox said the cabinet minister had decided “the time is not right for him to attend” the Riyadh summit.“The UK remains very concerned about Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance.“We encourage Turkish-Saudi collaboration and look forward to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia conducting a thorough, credible, transparent, and prompt investigation, as announced. Those bearing responsibility for his disappearance must be held to account,” the spokesman said. Mr Mnuchin said he decided not to attend after meeting with Mr Trump and Mr Pompeo at the White House. “I will not be participating in the Future Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia,” he said on Twitter. Bob Corker, a Republican senator who chairs of the foreign relations committee, said the White House had “clamped down” and was not sharing intelligence about the fate of Mr Khashoggi. “I can only surmise that probably the intel is not painting a pretty picture as it relates to Saudi Arabia,” Mr Corker said.The Washington Post also published Mr Khashoggi’s final column, where he wrote that “Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate, in a piece that apparently foreshadowed his own fate.In a note published with the column, Karen Attiah, global opinions editor at The Washington Post, said the piece captured Mr Khashoggi’s commitment to freedom in the Arab world: A freedom he apparently gave his life for.She said she received it from his assistant a day after he disappeared. “The Post held off publishing it because we hoped Jamal would come back to us so that he and I could edit it together,” she wrote. “Now I have to accept: That is not going to happen. This is the last piece of his I will edit for The Post.”Please review our commenting policyAnjem Choudary release: First picture of Islamist hate preacher out of prisonHunger Games star Sam Claflin joins cast of Peaky BlindersDuke of Sussex climbs Sydney Harbour Bridge after he and wife go barefoot on Bondi BeachComment: No deal Brexit is a great opportunity - the Tories should start by slashing taxesDavid Mundell tells Prime Minister he could not accept longer Brexit transitionMan pleads guilty to kidnapping and raping British backpacker in AustraliaComment: If Theresa May can\u0026#39t deliver Brexit on time, she should let someone else do the jobComment: Forget Brexit.

As they age the frigates need more time in maintenance as systems require updating or refitting.The fleet is due to be replaced by eight Type 26 ships, the first of which is currently under construction in Scotland.  Increasing naval deployments from six to nine months due to the lack of sailors has meant that ships are alongside for greater periods before the tour, to allow service personnel time with their families. In turn this means a longer maintenance period is required at the end. The ships are also in port for about two weeks in the middle of a deployment for crew leave.  HMS Portland is seen on the Atlantic Ocean, near Ascension Island. MoD data have shown that the Frigate is one of four in Royal Navy service that have spent no days at sea in 2018.Post-deployment each frigate will revert to a very low readiness state.Each costing about £130 million, the Type 23 frigates are all named after British Dukes and are known as ‘Duke Class’. Based in Portsmouth and Devonport the primary role of the ships is anti-submarine warfare, through the use of a towed array sonar which trails behind the ship, electronically listening for emissions from submarines.The data show that since 2010 the entire Type 23 fleet has spent a total of 32.5 years at sea. Assuming a crew of 185 sailors this equates to roughly 2.2 million man-days. On average that means each frigate has spent around 28.5 per cent of its time at sea annually. This figure will vary widely depending on the role of the vessel at the time and serviceability state.However, \u0027days at sea\u0027 can be an unhelpful metric when assessing the value to the taxpayer. Many tasks require a serviceable ship to be in port. For example, the Fleet Ready Escort role requires a ship to be available for immediate tasking, such as for escorting Russian warships through the Channel.Ships on deployment will also spend many days in port for maintenance, replenishment or to host visitors and foreign VIPs. Many UK defence sales come from such engagements.The Daily  understands that a number of training exercises in UK waters now happen from Monday to Friday, allowing servicemen and women to go home at weekends and shortening the overall time ships spend at sea.A government review of defence in 2010 saw 5,000 naval servicemen and women made redundant, and the UK’s overall defence budget reduced by 7.7 per cent over four years.New data show that the UK’s thirteen frigates have spent a total of 817 days at sea in the period to Oct 1. Between 2010 and 2014, the ships were at sea for at least 1500 days each year.HMS Argyll and HMS Sutherland have spent the longest at sea this year, with 117 and 154 days respectively.Admiral Lord West of Spithead, a former Labour security minister, told The Daily  that funding cuts were making recruitment and retention of staff more difficult for the Navy.“There’s no doubt that the hollowing out of the military is causing a lot of problems,” he said.“People aren’t doing the things they thought would happen when they joined up, and they’re saying ‘to hell with this’ and they’re going to go.”“We need all these ships operating. There are jobs for them to do around the world, and when they’re doing those jobs it helps stabilise things and helps keep peace”.A Royal Navy spokesman said: “Type 23 frigates are true workhorses  across the globe, as shown by current operations with HMS Monmouth in the USA and HMS Argyll in the Far East.”Ministry of DefencePlease review our commenting policyAnjem Choudary release: First picture of Islamist hate preacher out of prisonHunger Games star Sam Claflin joins cast of Peaky BlindersDuke of Sussex climbs Sydney Harbour Bridge after he and wife go barefoot on Bondi BeachComment: No deal Brexit is a great opportunity - the Tories should start by slashing taxesDavid Mundell tells Prime Minister he could not accept longer Brexit transitionMan pleads guilty to kidnapping and raping British backpacker in AustraliaComment: If Theresa May can\u0026#39t deliver Brexit on time, she should let someone else do the jobComment: Forget Brexit.

Apple rarely holds events outside of its home in California, especially since it built a devoted theatre on its new campus, though it revealed new iPads\u0026nbspat an education event held in a school in March.That education\u0026nbspevent,\u0026nbspduring which Apple revealed a different iPad update, was held in Chicago and was\u0026nbspunusually not livestreamed. It did not say whether the October event will be shown online, though it is likely that it will be.The company sent out personalised invitations to different media organisations to announce the event. All included an artistic variation on the Apple logo and a strapline reading There\u0027s more in the making, suggesting – along with the venue – that the launch could be focused on creativity.Apple\u0027s event will be held on the same day as rival OnePlus unveils its latest phone, the OnePlus 6T, in the same city and\u0026nbspjust a few hours before. That company – whose handset is often hailed as a challenger to the\u0026nbspiPhone – has spoken about how it is aiming to go mainstream with its latest handset and take on rivals like Apple.It will also bring an end to a busy period of launches, all scheduled before the holiday season, that has also included new Amazon Echos, phones from rivals including Samsung and Huawei, as well as Apple\u0027s own launch of three updated phones and the brand new Apple Watch Series 4.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What caught the City on the hop was by how much.\u0026nbspOfficial figures revealed sales volumes fell by 0.8 per cent when the consensus forecast was for the figure to come in at 0.4 per cent lower.

There was a decline in non-store retailing activity and no growth from non-food stores.Over the three months to September sales volumes were still up 1.2 per cent, although this was down from the 1.9 per cent rate in the three months to July.Retail sales account for around 30 per cent of total consumer spending and are seen as a bellwether of the direction of the overall economy.“Some easing back in retail sales was always to be expected in September given the overall strength in August and July,” said\u0026nbspHoward Archer of the EY Item Club.He added that third-quarter growth “buoys belief that consumer spending\u0026nbspmade an appreciable contribution as GDP growth likely improved to at least 0.6 per cent\u0026nbspquarter-on-quarter in the third quarter.”The ONS estimates that GDP growth was 0.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2018.But other analysts were less optimistic.“It looks like consumer spending – along with the weather – peaked in early summer and has been declining ever since,” said Ben Brettell of Hargreaves Lansdown.“Where we go from here is highly uncertain. Brexit is hitting consumer confidence hard, but on the plus side wage growth has hit a decade high while inflation is falling. So consumers look likely to have more spending power – the issue is whether they choose to use it, or keep their powder dry until more clarity over Brexit emerges.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It raises a number of issues for them to explore.\u0026nbsp“What is our definition of religion, and how fluid is that definition? What do we mean by value, and how might it be measured? Are the effects of religion in the past as important as its consequences in the present?\u0026nbsp“A candidate might also want to ask what we mean when we say ‘there is a God?’ Is affirming this statement enough, or should religious or theological enquiry be more specific – is talk of God in the abstract as helpful as discussion of particular religious ideas or texts?”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Theresa May leaves after a news conference at the European Union leaders summit in BrusselsPolice officers with a bomb disposal robot on Victoria Embankment opposite Scotland Yard police headquarters in central London after emergency services were alerted to reports of a suspicious packageScottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate the entirety of its power from wind after selling its remaining gas and hydro stations to Drax in a £702 million dealPrime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

Rather than Chrome and Google search, as users have seen ever since Android was introduced, there could be something else entirely.The change is good news for other browsers and search engines, which could now come pre-installed on Android phones instead of Chrome.Given recent data scandals from tech firms like Facebook and Google, device manufacturers may decide to make a statement by introducing apps that focus on online privacy.Private search engine DuckDuckGo could be among those to benefit, which currently represents only 0.18 per cent of the global search market.The privacy-focussed search engine processes around 30 million searches per day – the same number as Google handles in about 15 minutes.What does this mean for Google\u0027s mobile dominance?More than 80 per cent of the world\u0027s smartphones run the Android operating system, and this is unlikely to change significantly as a result of Google\u0027s new licensing system.What could change is the pervasiveness of its search engine, apps and other features. Perhaps the\u0026nbspmost significant of the features subject to the fees is the Play Store, which serves as a gateway through which popular apps can be downloaded.Not all apps are available through Google Play – earlier this year, Epic Games decided to roll out the Android version of its hugely popular game Fortnite\u0026nbspthrough its own website in order to avoid paying\u0026nbspGoogle for the privilege of hosting the app on Google Play.\u0026nbspBut this is an exception, not the rule.If the licensing fees prove too burdensome for phone and tablet manufacturers, this way of distributing apps may become a trend that threatens Google\u0027s monopoly of everything from email to maps.Google admits giving hundreds of firms access to your Gmail inboxEven without Google Play, Fortnite was able to amass more than 15 million downloads on Android within a month of launching, proving Google\u0027s app store is not a prerequisite for success.As Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney explained at the time: The great thing about the internet and the digital revolution is that this is possible, now that physical storefronts and middlemen distributors are no longer required.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But arguments as to where it begins rage quietly in the background all the time. Anywhere upwards of the Watford Gap, goes the hoary old joke, if you’re from London.Research last year conducted by Liverpool University suggested that the north now begins somewhere in Leicestershire, having moved south slightly from Derbyshire. To a northerner from Lancashire or Yorkshire, both those places seem to be more the Midlands… but aren’t Midlanders really just northerners anyway?The north-south ide in schools is real – and it’s more complex thanWe in the north wear northernness like a badge of pride. In 2005, The Wedding Present released a single called\u0026nbsp“I’m From Further North Than You”. The band is from Leeds, which is squarely in the north. Yet it’s considerably further south than Carlisle, the most northerly city in England.It would take you the best part of three hours to drive from Carlisle to Sheffield. Sheffield is indisputably in the north, yet skirts those Peak District lands, the Nottinghams and Chesterfields which form the gateway to the Midlands.iStock)Last summer, website The Tab drew up a map showing the north-south ide according to the number of shops of baked goods purveyor Greggs in any particular area, and according to this metric, Sheffield was put in the south.Ridiculous, of course, as anyone who watched the opening episode of\u0026nbspDoctor Who earlier this month will know. The new – and first female – Doctor is played by Jodie Whittaker, who hails from Huddersfield. The entire episode was set in Sheffield, and was as northern as you like – too northern, according to some commentators on Twitter. And heaven knows what the large contingent of American Whovians made of such joyous sight gags as a drunk throwing the salad out of his kebab at a menacing alien.If the boundaries are blurred, then northernness as a concept is perhaps even harder to pin down… at least from the outside. If you’re northern, you know it. If you’re not sure, then you probably aren’t.I have lived in the north all my life, first in Lancashire (and the bits re-designated Greater Manchester after local government reform in 1974), and then in Yorkshire. There is a rumour that northerners are warm and friendly, and we are. Or some of us, at least. We’re not exactly all dancing around like Munchkins there is still a fairly large contingent of people who will rip you off or rough you up or be generally as horrid as criminals are in London.But, by and large, the general populace does have what feels like a greater empathy for others than we, as northerners, often see on our sojourns down south. Up here in the north we genuinely smile at strangers on the street often even talk to them. I remember one of my first trips to the capital, to see Wigan play in the Rugby League Challenge Cup final at Wembley. A contingent of Wiganers were standing in Euston station, asking passersby how best to get to Wembley. They were roundly ignored, much to their puzzlement. A little while later I saw a different group handing out song sheets to stony-faced passengers on the Tube, offering to teach them some Wigan chants.We have space to breathe, in the north. The air’s a lot clearer than it used to be, thanks to various environmental acts and, oh, the fact that most of the heavy industry the country used to rely on us for has long since been closed down. We can get a decent-sized place to live. One of a northerner’s favourite TV shows is the famed comedy programme Location, Location, Location, which features Londoners with more money than sense cooing over properties the size of our toilets (which are all indoors these days, by\u0026nbspthe way) and which cost four or five times more than our actual houses.I am being facetious, of course. But it does feel that there is a thing we can call northernness, which might comprise warmth, and friendliness, and humour and grit, but which is much more than the sum of those cliched parts, and much harder to properly define.Oli Bentley is the creative director of a design studio based in Leeds, called Split. He has taken it upon himself to gather, like wool, various notions of northernness from writers and creatives for a project that was initially part of Leeds’ bid to become the European Capital of Culture in 2023.A bid which, of course, was thoroughly torpedoed by Brexit, and the news earlier this year that British cities will not be welcome to apply for the accolade after we leave the EU next year.Undaunted, those driving the Leeds bid decided to build on the legacy of the hard work carried out in the city by holding a year-long celebration of culture in 2023. One of the first projects out of the trap is the book Bentley has curated, called These Northern Types.Bentley is entrenched in the north. He studied design at Cumbria Institute of the Arts, up there in Carlisle, and while studying at Leeds College of Music after that he set up his Split business from his bedsit. So what is northernness?“Northernness is a myth,” asserts Bentley. “As a designer, I spend much of my time working with identities – specifically, visual identities for companies, institutions, iniduals, bands and arts organisations: brands. I think it is this daily involvement with the perceptions of identities that made me fascinated by this multifaceted, community-owned, slippery thing we call ‘northern identity’. That, and the realisation that, as a lifelong proud northerner, I was beginning to feel unsure about what that actually meant.”So Bentley went on a journey to rediscover, or perhaps discover for the first time, what northernness really is, if it actually exists, and he went to writers and artists and musicians for their take on it.That great northern actor\u0026nbspWarren Clarke\u0026nbsponce played the role of a corrupt copper in Red Riding, the TV adaptation of writer David Peace’s The Red Riding Quartet. The books are an astonishing slice of Yorkshire noir, interconnected narratives which weave in and out of the Yorkshire Ripper murders and the subsequent hunt for their perpetrator, Peter Sutcliffe.Clarke played chief superintendent Bill Molloy, a gruff, no-nonsense copper who you wouldn’t exactly say exuded warmth and friendliness, but instead another aspect of northernness: determination, and the recognition that London is a long way away. Presiding over a group of colleagues in a clandestine meeting, Molloy proposes a toast: “To the north, where we do what we want.”Molloy and his compatriots meant it for nefarious purposes, but it’s a mantra that endures for less sinister reasons. Here in the north we can’t rely on anyone else when we do, they rip the rug from under us. We commit with all our hearts and souls and lives to digging coal or tempering steel, and then someone in London closes the pits and the foundries and there’s nothing else for us to do. It is an irony that the north voted, on the whole, for Brexit a lot of European money was pumped, over the years, into communities ravaged by the death of industrialisation. But the majority Leave vote was born from that suspicion of outside forces exerting too much influence on a region that has been bitten and burned many times.The Capital of Culture being torpedoed and rising as a legacy project is an example of that determination, as is Bentley’s curating of the book These Northern Types. It is, as you’d expect from someone who trained in design, an artefact as much as a text it comprises 17 inidually-bound books, collected together, and created by some of the most interesting thinkers in the north today.In his introduction to the book, Bentley writes: “The focus of this project is, at times, less about location, and more about class – an issue that touches nearly every chapter. Or they are about what it is to be ‘other’ to ‘the position of civility... always taken by the seat of power’.“About living in the other half of the country from the centres of power, finance, media, intellectualism and culture – a situation shared not only with communities from Wales to Dorset to Scotland, but with communities all over the globe.”These Northern Types offers a taste of the north that is unparalleled since someone in Wigan decided to put a meat and potato pie between a barm cake. It is beautiful to look at yet uncompromising and direct. In the essay “Does It Still Matter Where We Come From?”, Dr Katy Wright addresses whether there is, in fact, any need to align yourself to northernness or anything else.She writes: “For many – though by no means all – northernness has involved a sense of marginalisation, abandonment and peripherality, which has often been accompanied by experiences of misrecognition, and stereotypes projected from outside. These have involved portraying northerners as, variously, uneducated, opinionated, mean with money, unsophisticated or conservative. Struggling northern towns and cities like Hull, Scunthorpe, Barnsley and Morecambe provide the punchlines to unfunny jokes about ‘crap towns’ and shitholes.”It is, after all, grim up north. At first it was grim because of the industry that roosted here like dark ravens, the sooty chimneys of Dickens’ Coketown (a thinly disguised Preston), the blackened faces of the miners, the clang-and-heat of the Hephaestan steel forges, the hypnotic rattle of the cotton looms. And then it was grim because the industry was torn down. Grim because of the grit and we have grit because of the grimness.Boff Whalley was the guitarist in agit-popsters Chumbawamba now he is a playwright and the founder of the Commoners Choir. His piece is about northern grit, and how the elements haven’t just formed our dramatic landscape, but do the same to us.“So much of northern culture – historical, social and political – has sprung from our weather,” he writes. “The Smiths were The Smiths and not the Beach Boys because they were born into a land of dripping raincoats and stone doorways that you huddle into. Ted Hughes thrived on the bleak grey swirl of Yorkshire uplands. Our favourite fiction, from the Brontes to Alan Sillitoe to Ken Loach, is peppered with the drama of rain. Many of Turner’s paintings are suffused with storms, mists and fogs (he climbed the hill above what’s now my home town at the foot of the Yorkshire Dales to make endless studies for his great painterly skies) English films – from Billy Elliot to The Full Monty – are drenched in the melancholy of rain. And what comes of all this dour, dull weather? Resilience. Resolve. Gritting your teeth. Grit.”Grim… grit… here’s another one for you. Graft. That means hard work. It’s also the name of the typeface Oli Bentley put together for the book and for anyone else who wants to use it. A typeface for the north. Bentley himself questioned the point of the exercise, other than being a nice little artistic project. Then he had another idea: “Let’s use the typeface to work with local community groups across the north. We bring the letters, they bring the words. Then we put these words up in the places they’re from. This led to the idea of printing giant outdoor posters – the sort you can easily and cheaply flypost. To work with local writers to amplify voices – not just listen, but help them be heard.”Because being heard is something the north struggles with. When we complain that we’re being left behind, we get thrown bones such as the Northern Powerhouse project, an admittedly ambitious plan to boost the economy of the north, put into place by the Conservative-Liberal coalition, much lauded and trumpeted, and then quietly… well, if not abandoned, then at least put on the shelf with the other exciting new initiatives that were going to transform the north, until such time as anyone south of wherever the north’s border is these days cares enough to put money into it. And meanwhile transport – one of the major tenets of the Northern Powerhouse – continues to struggle, with train services especially a bone of particular contention. They don’t call Northern Rail “Northern Fail” for nothing these days.Boff Whalley mentioned The Smiths and, indeed, music is part of the fabric of the north. Benjamin Myers is an author who this year won the Walter Scott Prize for his novel The Gallows Pole. It brought him £25,000, but his win was largely ignored by the London-centric publishing press. For the book, Myers writes about music, as well, and in doing so explodes a myth about living in the north that is prevalent. His piece is a paean to watching bands, and then forming one, a familiar rite of passage: “You gig round the north, the four of you, with your bad hair and bumfluff ’taches. You play es and established venues you play political benefits and school halls and nightclubs and student unions.Emmerdale\u0026nbsprolling hills, you know (Getty)“Being in a band forces you to be an adult at 15 as you deal with clueless promoters and jealous death metal bands, American rock stars and patronising regional DJs. You ward off stage-invading Nazi skinheads and cynical producers. You duck flying bottles and you get thrown out of your own shows for being underage.“You come from that part of the north that rarely gets written about – neither the gritty towns and cities of economic decline nor the dales and vales and uplands, but somewhere in between: the lower-middle-class suburbs. Here is a seemingly endless maze of culs-de-sac and alleyways, tarmac and green spaces, where aspiration exists, and creative seeds are sown, yet which broader culture barely seems to acknowledge, as if the north is either terraced houses or Dales farmlands, Corrie or Emmerdale. It’s not that black and white though most live in a grey-area Britain.”Are we seeing the resurgence of Nazism? This graphic novel thinks soSpoiler alert: Have fractured viewing habits ruined the suspense?Dacre Stoker on resurrecting his great-grand-uncle’s vampireThrough the works in These Northern Types, only a fraction of which are referenced here, several things seem to emerge. There is something called northernness, but it’s difficult to pin down. We’re just like everybody else, but completely different. We don’t even know where the north begins, nor can we agree on what it really means to be northern.It’s almost as if the ideas of northernness are laid down by other people, and none of them are what we really feel. But we can’t voice how we truly are inside, because to examine it too closely would make it seem less distinct, less real.The north is a place made up of iniduals, bound by an ethereal quality that is at once a myth and, conversely, as real as grit and graft. Northernness is perhaps something everyone here has, and is, but in subtly and uniquely different ways. The north makes us, and northernness is what we make it. So raise your glasses please, to the north: where we do – and can be – what we want.‘These Northern Types’ is out now, priced £32, from splitNorth of EnglandCapital of CultureShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Normally these kinds of structures are known at lower redshifts, which means when the Universe has had much more time to evolve and construct such huge things. It was a surprise to see something this evolved when the Universe was relatively young!The structure, which is known by scientists as Hyperion, was spotted by a team of scientists who used the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope to peer into the early universe and look for galaxies forming. It was then they spotted Hyperion, a colossal mass that is more than a million billion times that of the Sun.Vast cosmic explosions could be flinging gold across the universeIt is not only huge but very complex. Hyperion is made up of at least seven high-density regions, which are strung together by threads of galaxies. That structure is different to the kind of superclusters we usually see closer to us, even though the size is similar.Superclusters closer to Earth tend to a much more concentrated distribution of mass with clear structural features, explains Brian Lemaux, an astronomer from University of California, Davis and LAM, and a member of the team behind this result. But in Hyperion, the mass is distributed much more uniformly in a series of connected blobs, populated by loose associations of galaxies.The difference is probably a consequence of the fact that the closer by superclusters have had billions of years of being pushed into denser regions by galaxies. Hyperion, which is much younger, has been subject to that process much less.Eventually, Hyperion will probably evolve into something similar to those structures: the kind that make up the Sloan Great Wall, or the Virgo Supercluster in which our own galaxy sits. Understanding how that process happens could allow us to peer into the past of our own galaxy and understand how it might have formed.Understanding Hyperion and how it compares to similar recent structures can give insights into how the Universe developed in the past and will evolve into the future, and allows us the opportunity to challenge some models of supercluster formation, said\u0026nbspCucciati. Unearthing this cosmic titan helps uncover the history of these large-scale structures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People start off in different places.”The scientists came to their conclusions by studying 3,000 pairs of British twins – identical and non-identical.“Identical twins are 100 per cent genetically identical, they are clones of one another, so they share all their DNA and they share a home environment – so any differences between identical twins can’t be due to their home environment, can’t be due to their genes,” said Dr Smith-Woolley.Comparing identical and non-identical pairs of twins enabled\u0026nbspresearchers to measure the overall impact of genetics on how much people differ when it comes to measures such as exam scores.More than 1,000 genes that influence academic success identifiedIf identical twins’ exam scores are more alike than non-identical twins’, it is an indication genetic factors are driving that success.Using\u0026nbspComplete University Guide\u0026nbsprankings to determine institution quality, the scientists also found the quality of university that students opted for was influenced by genes, even after accounting for A-level achievement.Besides their twin study – which is not able to identify specific genes linked to achievement – researchers\u0026nbspalso calculated “polygenic scores”, adding up the effects of thousands of DNA variants previous studies have linked to success in education.The resulting\u0026nbspscores accounted for a small fraction of the differences between people, compared to the results of the twin study – an effect the scientists think results from the small number of genes so far linked with educational achievement.“That’s fairly small at the moment … but I think it shows that science is getting to the point where it can start predicting outcomes from DNA alone.”Dr David Hill, a statistical geneticist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study, said the research was sound, but perhaps not surprising.Scientists think most behaviours are probably the results of a complex interaction between genes and people’s environments.Considering previous research that has demonstrated the way in which educational success appears to be inherited within families, he said it was already clear there is a genetic component.“I don’t really think anyone would expect there to not be a genetic influence acting on university success,” he said, “given that all traits are expected to be somewhat heritable, and we already know that educational success, intelligence, personality, and whether or not one chooses to take university entrance exams and how well they do at them, have all been shown to be heritable.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Smaller craft have previously employed ion thrusters to reach asteroids and the moon.The ion drive will be used not to accelerate the spacecraft but to act as a brake as it falls into the grip of the sun\u0027s powerful gravity.A complex series of fly-bys past the Earth, Venus and Mercury will further reduce its velocity.Even so, BepiColumbo will reach a top speed of 60 kilometres (37 miles) per second.The European Space Agency\u0027s Mercury Planet Orbiter (MPO), which will survey the planet\u0027s surface and probe its chemistry, was built by satellite company Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage.Airbus also constructed the power unit carrying the orbiters, the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM), in the UK. The ion thrusters were supplied by British defence technology company QinetiQ.One of the European orbiter\u0027s 11 instruments, the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (Mixs) was designed and built at the University of Leicester.The Japanese space agency Jaxa\u0027s Mercury Magnetosphere Orbiter (MMO) will study the planet\u0027s internal structure and enveloping magnetic field.A major challenge for mission planners was ensuring the spacecraft could withstand searing temperatures of more than 350C so close to the sun.Protective measures include a heat shield, novel ceramic and titanium insulation, ammonia-filled heat pipes, and in the case of the Japanese orbiter, spinning.Dr Graham Turnock, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said: UK scientists, engineers and technicians have played a vital role in developing BepiColombo and the incredibly sophisticated set of scientific instruments on board.The international collaboration involved in this mission shows how our leading role in the European Space Agency is ensuring the UK thrives in the new space age, bringing real benefits to UK companies and scientists.Only two spacecraft have previously visited Mercury. Nasa\u0027s Mariner 10 flew past the planet three times in 1974-75 and the American space agency\u0027s Messenger probe orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015, taking photos of the surface.Dr Jerry Bolter, project manager at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, said: The scientists describe Messenger as the hors d\u0027oeuvre and Bepi asThe spacecraft was named after the late Guiseppe Bepi Colombo, an Italian scientist and engineer who played a leading role in the 1974 Mariner 10 mission to Mercury.Paolo Ferri, head of missions at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, said: Mercury is a planet of extremes, and getting there requires some equally extreme techniques, navigation solutions and operations expertise.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What we are not doing – we are not standing here proposing an extension to the implementation period.“What we are doing is working to ensure we have a solution the backstop in Northern Ireland, which is currently a blockage to completing the deal, that enables us to get on with completing the deal that delivers on the vote of the British people and is good for the future of the UK.”Ms May’s cryptic answer could be a response to disquiet in her party about the plans.\u0026nbspThe period – during which the UK would stay completely tied to EU rules without any say on them – is hugely unpopular with Brexiteers, who believe it would make Britain a “vassal state” of the bloc.On Wednesday evening Antonio\u0026nbspTajani, the European Parliament president, told reporters the prime minister had “mentioned the idea of an extension of a transition period as one possibility that is on the table and would be looked into” in a meeting with him and the 27 EU leaders.Other Brussels sources confirmed to The Independent that the PM had also raised the policy in bilateral meetings with top EU officials, and that British negotiators had been sounding out the possibility of extending it in negotiations for “months”.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

During it practically nothing would change for the UK – Britain would continue to implement all EU law, stay in the single market and customs union and under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.\u0026nbspThe UK would however not be represented in EU institutions like the parliament, council, and commission and would therefore have no say in drawing up the rules.“A further idea that has emerged – and it is an idea at this stage – is to create an option to extend the implementation period for a matter of months – and it would only be for a matter of months,” the prime minister told reporters on the summit’s doorstep as she arrived on Thursday morning.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Parliament is going to insist on using its proper authority.”And Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, said: “Labour doesn’t accept that the choice facing parliament will be between whatever deal Theresa May cobbles together or no deal.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“That is not a meaningful vote and Ministers can’t be allowed to silence parliament. MPs must be given the opportunity to scrutinise, consider and, where appropriate, amend any resolution the government puts forward.”The controversy comes as hundreds of thousands of people prepare to march in central London this Saturday to demand a People’s Vote referendum.The Independent has been running its own Final Say campaign to demand the referendum, with more than 860,000 people having signed its petition so far.In April, asked whether the motion on the Brexit deal “would be amendable”, Mr Baker replied: “I believe the position is that parliament can always seek to amend motions.”And he suggested MPs would be able to impose a referendum, or seek to change the nature of the deal, which might send the prime minister back to the negotiating table.EU leaders decide to shelve plans for Brexit summit in November May rejected EU offer to break Brexit deadlock because of costFrench government warns on visas after no-deal BrexitNHS cannot be \u0027confident\u0027 about medicine supplies after no deal Brexit\u0026nbsp“Clearly, the range of amendments that is possible is within the bounds of the imagination of all members of parliament,” Mr Baker told the committee.But, in his letter, Mr Raab “Once the deal is presented to parliament, the procedure through which it is voted upon must allow for an unequivocal decision, and one which is clear to the British public.”A six-page memorandum suggested amendments would only be accepted if the main motion passed first. If the motion fell, the amendments might only be considered “points of view”.The letter also warned: “Amendments – even those which may not intend to affect approval – may actually result in the government being unable to ratify the withdrawal agreement.“It is important, however, to recognise the need ultimately for the House to consider the question that is in reality before the UK – whether or not to accept the deal that the government has negotiated with the EU.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I’m not as comfortable that that’s the case any more.”Mr Mercer, who backed Remain, went on to criticise the Chequers plan.\u0026nbspHe said: “If you look at Chequers, for example, that is your classic professional politician’s answer because it’s right down the middle. It doesn’t make anybody happy. It’s the ultimate in not making a decision.“And I’m afraid, people who pay our wages and vote for us expect us to make decisions and get on with government, not be fixated on us retaining our position.”It is not the first time Mr Mercer has criticised his own party.Tories hit by election candidate shortage with activists ‘demoralised’Tories adopting ‘far-right ideology’ says former leader of its MEPsLast year, he claimed the party “still seems punch-drunk” and was “in danger of losing credibility”.He told The House that it was his ambition to be defence secretary and have a decade “to rip apart that department, make it work”.Vowing to fight for the type of country he wants to see, he said: “Going forward, at the end of the day, above everything about being an MP, above being Johnny Mercer, any of this stuff, a Conservative or whatever, I’m a patriot.“I’m not going to sit at the back of the bus and watch it head towards the edge of the cliff.

But she cannot let it distract her from securing a deal on BrexitClick to followIndy PoliticsThe row over universal credit could not have come at a worse time for\u0026nbspTheresa May. With most of Whitehall’s resources and almost all of Downing Street’s political capital focused on Brexit, No 10 is now also having to stave off growing backbench unrest about the government’s flagship welfare policy.The introduction of the new system has been dogged by delays and warnings about the impact on struggling families. Ministers have already made a series of changes and no one doubts that more will be needed. Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, told the Commons yesterday that the government “will make sure we get this benefit right”. People may ask why, six years after the change was approved by parliament, it has not done so already.Tory backbenchers are increasingly concerned about the policy and the impact it will have on their constituents. This is not a minor reform – the switch to universal credit will affect eight million working-age people. MPs are already being bombarded with tales of people forced into debt, destitution and, according to one Labour MP, prostitution\u0026nbspas they are transferred to the new system.Labour fails to force government to release universal credit papersPolitically, too, the fiasco is damaging for the Conservatives. If the next election is not until 2022, it is issues of public services and welfare that could prove pivotal, especially universal credit, which directly affects more than one in eight voters. The public bought into the idea of belt-tightening when it was needed to reduce the deficit. With the economy growing and Ms May having heralded the end of austerity, that argument no longer holds.The tales of hardship that accompany every debate on universal credit will trouble Tories who fear once again being seen as the nasty party, and fuel perceptions that Conservative modernisers worked so hard to dispel.The disastrous implementation of the policy also spectacularly undermines what will inevitably be one of the Tories’ main electoral arguments: that they are the party of competence and efficient management. The problem is not the concept of universal credit, which has cross-party support, but the implementation of it.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Theresa May leaves after a news conference at the European Union leaders summit in BrusselsPolice officers with a bomb disposal robot on Victoria Embankment opposite Scotland Yard police headquarters in central London after emergency services were alerted to reports of a suspicious packageScottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate the entirety of its power from wind after selling its remaining gas and hydro stations to Drax in a £702 million dealPrime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

Field, who has represented Birkenhead from almost 40 years, revealed in a letter to party chief whip Nick Brown that he could no longer serve the party as the leadership was overseeing the erosion of our core valuesThe policy was seized on by George Osborne at a time when he was looking for a vehicle for swingeing welfare cuts to help reduce the\u0026nbspdeficit. The result is a policy pushed through on the cheap, without the proper funding and thought needed to adequately implement such a drastic change to the welfare system. Philip Hammond is likely to use this month’s Budget to plough further money into the policy, but it is unlikely to be enough to solve its\u0026nbspmultiple problems.The frustration for Ms May is that the fiasco causing her such a headache is not of her own making. Universal credit was introduced long before she became prime minister. It is hard to believe that, if she could, Ms May would not quietly scrap it and be done. But that would be a huge admission of failure on the part of her government and a major victory for Labour. \u0026nbspUniversal credit is the greatest blunder by a British government yetInstead we can expect further delays as ministers scramble to amend the flawed policy while also staving off the prospect of a parliamentary defeat. With Tory backbenchers warning that almost 30 of them are prepared to vote against the government on the issue, any significant votes on universal credit\u0026nbspare likely to be pushed back until next summer at the earliest. No 10 cannot afford to let this domestic debacle distract from the task of securing a Brexit deal that can command parliament’s support.The government has managed to unite Jeremy Corbyn and Jacob Rees-Mogg, Gordon Brown and John Major, in calling for the full roll-out to be halted.Mr Major this week compared the row to the poll tax crisis that helped bring down Margaret Thatcher. If he is referring to a government ploughing ahead with a deeply unpopular policy that can only cause it further trouble, the comparison is, for Ms May, worryingly close to the mark.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There was a decline in non-store retailing activity and no growth from non-food stores.Over the three months to September sales volumes were still up 1.2 per cent, although this was down from the 1.9 per cent rate in the three months to July.Retail sales account for around 30 per cent of total consumer spending and are seen as a bellwether of the direction of the overall economy.“Some easing back in retail sales was always to be expected in September given the overall strength in August and July,” said\u0026nbspHoward Archer of the EY Item Club.He added that third-quarter growth “buoys belief that consumer spending\u0026nbspmade an appreciable contribution as GDP growth likely improved to at least 0.6 per cent\u0026nbspquarter-on-quarter in the third quarter.”The ONS estimates that GDP growth was 0.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2018.But other analysts were less optimistic.“It looks like consumer spending – along with the weather – peaked in early summer and has been declining ever since,” said Ben Brettell of Hargreaves Lansdown.“Where we go from here is highly uncertain. Brexit is hitting consumer confidence hard, but on the plus side wage growth has hit a decade high while inflation is falling. So consumers look likely to have more spending power – the issue is whether they choose to use it, or keep their powder dry until more clarity over Brexit emerges.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence,” he wrote.\u0026nbsp“As a result, Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate.”\u0026nbspPompeo arrives in Saudi Arabia to discuss Jamal Khashoggi disappearanceIn the column, Mr Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen who went into self-imposed exile in the US following\u0026nbspthe rise of the crown prince, also discussed the practice of Middle Eastern governments blocking internet access to keep tight control of the information their citizens can see.\u0026nbsp“The Arab world is facing its own version of an Iron Curtain, imposed not by external actors but through domestic forces vying for power,” he wrote.\u0026nbspSuspects in Khashoggi case ‘tied to Saudi Crown Prince or his circle’Turkey seeks to reshape ties with US and Saudi over missing journalistIMF chief pulls out of Saudi conference amid missing journalist stormInside the kingdom, Saudis rattled by handling of Jamal Khashoggi caseHe praised the Post for translating many of his columns into Arabic and said it was important for Middle Easterners to be able to read about democracy in the West.He also said it was critical\u0026nbspArab voices had\u0026nbspa platform from which to be heard.\u0026nbsp“We suffer from poverty, mismanagement and poor education,” Mr Khashoggi wrote. “Through the creation of an independent international forum, isolated from the influence of nationalist governments spreading hate through propaganda, ordinary people in the Arab world would be able to address the structural problems their societies face.”Mr Khashoggi\u0026nbspstarted writing for the\u0026nbspPost’s\u0026nbspopinion section in September 2017 and his columns often criticised the prince and direction the Saudi kingdom was taking.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Honduran migrants heading in a caravan to the United States, leave Guatemala City.

European car industry makes dramatic plea in bid to avert hard Brexit                Austria has PLAN B for hard Brexit says KurzUnless Mr Hammond himself gives the commitment, they will seek to amend the forthcoming Finance Bill to declare: Her Majesty\u0027s Government, having declared its intention to leave, and having passed legislation to leave, will pay no contribution to the European Union and its institutions after March 29th, 2019.Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns commented: We voted to take back control, and it\u0027s always been the case that Parliament oversees the budget, not the other way around.It\u0027s absurd that there is to be a Budget before the final Brexit deal.That is effectively writing a blank cheque to the EU, and that leaves the danger that Article 50 may be extended with full funding.I have personally heard from ministers and whips that this is a possibility.Brexit news: Brexiteers are plotting to stop Mrs May extending the transition period (Image: )What I would like to propose in the Finance Bill is an amendment to say we will not pay any further monies to the EU after the 29th March 2019 without further Parliamentary approval.We need that guarantee because this is what the country voted for.Bow Group chairman Councillor Benjamin Harris-Quinney said: With or without a deal, we leave the EU on March 29th 2019.Parliament should therefore not approve any budget that allows the Exchequer to make any payment to the EU after that date, without its subsequent consent.The Chancellor should know that any attempt to sneak a Budget through that allows money to continue to flow to the EU will be opposed by Brexiteer MPs tooth and nail, and should prepare his statement accordingly.Elsewhere, Cabinet Minister Andrea Leadsom yesterday promised in the House of Commons that the UK will leave the EU on March 29, 2019, as planned.Brexit news: Theresa May is becoming increasingly isolated in Brussels and Westminster (Image: )Taking MPs\u0027 questions about how much power they will have to approve or amend any Brexit deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels, the pro-Leave Commons Leader declared: The UK will be leaving the EU Union on 29 March 2019.Once a deal with the EU has been agreed ... Parliament will have the choice to accept or reject that deal.If Parliament accepts the deal, we will introduce an EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill to implement the agreement in domestic legislation. If Parliament chooses to reject the deal, the Government will be unable to ratify the agreement.In June Parliament voted to repeal the 1972 Act under which Britain joined the bloc - a move MPs say should make Brexit unstoppable.Mrs Leadsom also promised that Parliament\u0027s February half-term holiday would go ahead - subject to the progress of business - amid speculation Downing Street is considering cancelling it to give the Commons time to pass Brexit legislation.Brexit news: Theresa May has sparked fury by considering to delay Brexit (Image: REUTERS)Downing Street meanwhile confirmed it did not plan to cancel Christmas for MPs, after claims their festive break could be postponed to deal with EU matters if a deal with Brussels cannot be struck until mid-December.Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood last night backed the backbench threat to vote against the Budget.He said: Many Conservative MPs are making clear to the Government that we won\u0027t support legislation seeking to prolong transition and large payments for no good reason.Extending our period under EU control would take us into another seven-year spending period and it would want even more money from us.

It could be very expensive to do.It is unknown as to whether this had approval from the Cabinet when it met earlier this week.But it also doesn\u0027t solve the problem of the backstop, because the backstop would remain, as far as one can tell, at the end of this additional transition.It seems to me to be a rather poor attempt at kicking the can down the road.

We risk being sold down the river.Barring a last-minute revolt by Tory Brexiteers, Brussels has won and we have lost. The world’s sixth-largest economy will not just be worse off outside the EU, but reduced to a powerless political pawn on its margins — and paying for it.Sniggering can be heard across the capitals of Europe, with France guffawing loudest. The British Lion is a toothless kitten and we are the laughing stock of Europe.Unless stopped by her Cabinet, her MPs or by Parliament itself, this Prime Minister seems to be leading us to the greatest defeat since the Norman Conquest in , the last time we capitulated to a foreign power.The ransom demanded for our degrading humiliation — £BILLION of taxpayers’ money — is merely a down payment. The botched Chequers deal will bind this country in subordination to Europe.Forget about becoming a sovereign, free-trading nation. We will accept EU rules indefinitely while having no say at all in their terms or conditions. In effect, our economy will be run by Brussels, not by our democratically elected government.For an example of missed opportunities and failed leadership, this beats even last year’s election disaster, which wasted the first Tory majority for  years and put Marxist Labour within grasp of power.Worse, it now seems the PM’s apparent last-ditch capitulation was stitched up months ago behind closed doors after a dodgy threat by car giants to leave the UK.Now the Tory party is in uproar, with cries for a leadership contest. Downing Street is stupidly threatening a snap election. Nobody buys that except Jeremy Corbyn, who is licking his lips at the scent of power. Ministers, like frogs in a pot, are sizing up whether to jump or stew. Careers will be made or broken.At least three — and maybe six — are threatening to quit at tomorrow’s Cabinet unless Theresa blinks. Tory MPs are close to triggering a leadership fight, with sketchy plans for a quick and ruthless contest. “We have the numbers,” says one Tory MP.“If anything the mood is hardening, not softening.”Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, the first rebel to quit Cabinet, will certainly run, infuriating Boris Johnson, who thinks it should be him. Once the gun is fired, half the Cabinet and plenty of hopefuls will join in.Everyone deserves blame, including Brexiteers who assumed the game was over after their victorious out vote and abandoned the field. Remainers are at fault for refusing to accept the will of the people — and the shortcomings of their beloved EU.But it is Downing Street, and Theresa May personally, who must take responsibility. Mrs May has dreamed of being Prime Minister since she was a child.It’s a tough job. It means leading from the front, making swt decisions and rallying the country with confidence and authority in dficult times.Instead, Mrs May’s team talk like defeatists about parliamentary “arithmetic”. How can she push through a dficult Brexit against ferocious opposition without a commanding Commons majority  But who was responsible for that parliamentary arithmetic It was Theresa May alone who decided to call an unforced election and it was she who single-handedly blew it. Her only task was to deliver the referendum mandate handed to her by .million voters. She blew that, too.People knew the risks. They did not vote for us to stay half-in, half-out or to see our sovereignty handed over to foreign powers. To govern is to decide. Mrs May made a career out of being the strong and silent type.Many of her MPs worry she is actually weak, vacillating and inarticulate.We are becoming accustomed to ruthless “wet jobs” by authoritarian tyrannies such as Russia, North Korea and the People’s Republic of China, many of them “friends” of Jeremy Corbyn.But Saudi Arabia has always revelled in public and private bloodshed. When it comes to terrorism, all roads lead back to Riyadh.A respectable MP, who does not joke about such matters, tells me the Saudi Embassy in London once had a torture chamber in the basement.I wonderit still does Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After all, as we remember from school, this ancient British queen rose up against the Roman Empire, winning battles, slaughtering enemies and forcing the Romans to contemplate leaving Britain all together.“But, hang on,” I replied. “Wasn’t Boudicca eventually defeated ”Whatever the details, my friend was right. It is time for Theresa May to call on her deepest reserves of defiance and stand up to the European Union.Brussels has rejected her Brexit proposals, insulted us at the recent Salzburg summit and wants to dismember the United Kingdom by effectively annexing Northern Ireland for itself.Theresa May’s respect towards the EU has been met consistently with contempt for Britain. She has wished Brussels every success, while they wish us nothing but failure and decline. She has suggested solutions while they point out problems. And she has taken her Government to the brink by proposing a future relationship that is hated by many of her own MPs and supporters.It is time, now, to stop.Her Chequers plan already goes too far. It would tie us to European laws, over which we would have no say, and force us to accept the rulings of the European Court of Justice.It would prevent us from taking our own decisions and making our economy more competitive. And it almost certainly stops us from striking our own trade deals.Worse still,the Government persists with Chequers, we will end up with something even worse: Chequers Minus, which could mean making annual payments to Brussels, complying with more EU laws and accepting liberal immigration rules that amount to continued free movement.The longer we pretend Chequers can survive, the worse the outcome will be. As we negotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, Britain should be seeking watertight assurances about our future relationship. Without them, we will sign away a £billion orce payment without any confidence we will get a fair deal for the future.But the crisis the Prime Minister described to Parliament yesterday, and which the Cabinet will discuss today, is not about Chequers, but the so-called “backstop” — what should happen to Northern Irelandthere is no eventual agreement on the future relationship.The EU’s proposition is an outrage. If there is no deal on the future relationship, they expect Northern Ireland to remain inside the Customs Union and, in effect, the single market.That would mean, in trying to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, we would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That’s right, a border within our own country to avoid having one with another.The backstop would mean politicians in the Republic have a say over laws in Northern Ireland, while politicians in Belfast and London would have none. And it effectively breaches the Good Friday Agreement, which demands that Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom is respected unless a majority of Northern Irish people vote for the reunication of Ireland.The one concession the EU seems willing to make is that the whole of the United Kingdom can remain inside the Customs Union, not just Northern Ireland.But it insists there can be no time limit, and no right for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from the backstop.In other words, we would be trapped inside the Customs Union — following laws over which we have no say, letting Brussels grant trading access to our market for other countries and leaving us unable to agree trade deals of our own — for ever.This, of course, has always been the EU’s game. They have cynically used the Northern Irish peace process to try to tie the whole of the United Kingdom to the EU’s rules and regulations. And in their naivety, our negotiators have walked straight into the trap.The PM needs to tell the EU to get stuffed. And she must go back to the drawing board. She must replace Chequers with an ambitious, Canada Plus, free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. She must insist that the Northern Irish solution lies with technology and policy that avoid checks at the border. And she must tear up the backstop.One alternative, still a compromise for Brexiteers like me, is to agree that the UK will remain inside the Customs Union for a period of up to five years while the appropriate systems are put into place.Critics will say the EU will never agree. Butthey cannot accept a trade deal consistent with their principles and which respects the integrity of their single market, we know they seek only a damaging deal for Britain, or no deal at all.Others will say the Government could not get this kind of plan through the Commons. But it stands a better chance than Chequers Minus.This was, in fact, the plan Theresa May first set out at Lancaster House in January .There, she warned against a Chequers-style deal, saying: “We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave” and “we will not have truly leftwe are not in control of our own laws”.And she warned against what the backstop demands. She insisted on creating “no new barriers to living and doing business within our own Union”, and warned against “an unlimited transitional status”, which she called a “kind of permanent political purgatory”.Instead, she sought “a comprehensive free trade agreement” and the freedom for “Britain to negotiate its own trade agreements” with other countries.In other words, she described the Canada Plus agreement that is prepared and drafted but gathering dust inside the Brexit Department.Many years ago, The Sun advised us to say “up yours, Delors” to a meddling European Commissioner.

They got neither.Both couples claimed other commitments but, given that they all took centre stage at Harry and Meghan’s nuptials and the Beckhams also made the cut for William and Kate’s big day, perhaps they felt this wasn’t A-list enough Instead, we had to make do with, among others, models Naomi Campbell, Cara ­Delevingne and Kate Moss, X Factor judges Robbie Williams and Ayda Field, and actresses Demi Moore and Liv Tyler.Some of whom uploaded gushing videos from the event and Instagram photos of their outfits with hashtag plugs for ­ious clothing brands.At a “royal” wedding  The notoriously traditional Queen Mother must be turning in her grave.There will be the modernisers within the palace walls who regard this as “progress” for a monarchy that, as they see it, must appeal to a younger generationit is to survive.But to my mind, it’s the complete opposite.The pomp, ceremony, tradition, duty and, most importantly, ­mystique of the royals is what sustains them.This wedding — between a “Princess” who performs no royal duties and her Jack of tequila trade — has shone a ­spotlight on the blindingly obvious threat that, once the dutul Queen and Prince Philip are no longer with us, the ­“modern” monarchy will continue to make ever decreasing circles until the taxpayer finally decides, “Hang on — they’re just like us” and the game will be up.With this #royalwedding where even the bride’s mother, left, Instagrammed a designer plug “for my amazing dress” that threat has just come one step closer.RITA ORA is promoting her new album Phoenix. “It’s my first global release of an album.I’m really excited to express my music to the world,” she says.But why the seemingly ­regular need to, er, express her breasts at the same time After all, Ed Sheeran has never posed in just his kecks and he’s sold  squillion records.ANGRY passengers on a flight from London Heathrow to Istanbul intervened to stop Home Office officials from deporting Somalian Yaqub Ahmed.“I know he’s scared,” protested one, before leading a chant of: “Take him off the plane, take him off the plane.”Though probably not as scared as the -year-old girl who was gang-raped in London by Ahmed and two of his equally unsavoury friends – the crime for which he was being deported before these witless do-gooders stepped in.Pitully, the officials capitulated and Ahmed is still in this country awaiting our next move.Meanwhile, as some of the passengers virtue-signalled their liberal credentials by posting footage of the showdown, perhaps they could now be identied and charged with obstructing the course of justice Or, at the very least, be asked to welcome the delightful Mr Ahmed into their own homes until such time as his removal can be rearranged Let’s seetheir liberalism extends to putting their own teenage daughters at risk.PIZZAS and pies must shrink to tackle obesity, claim new official guidelines from Public Health England.Sigh. Amazing, isn’t it, how millions of people manage to stay slim by eating healthily and doing moderate exercise while advocating the same mindset to their children Radical, I know, buta pizza is large, how about sharing it Or perhaps not buying it at all Or is a slice of personal responsibility too hard to swallow CHANNING Tatum and Jessie J are dating.We know this because they’ve been spotted ­laughing together at a mini-golf course.Ah yes, those heady, early months of dating when you’re presenting the best side of yourself and pretending you just love doing kooky stuff like ­hitting a ball into the clown’s mouth or paddling in pointless circles around the local ­boating lake.Then the eager-to-please phase passes and, before you know it, you’re watching ­separate TV shows in dferent parts of the house.

boxing","story":"It’s not the first time a Sun reporter has had to dodge a punch but this time it’s a heavyweight trying to land one, with his personal trainer egging him on.Luckily for me, this heavyweight is st Darren “Dibsy” McClintock, whose obesity battle hit the headlines after his trainer Mike Hind banned takeaways from serving him.And even luckier, we have both just endured a -minute bootcamp workout at Mike’s gym — and as Dibsy tips the scales at nearly four times my body weight, it means I’ve got a bit more energy left than he has, enough to dodge his last few lunges in the boxing ring.But, exhausted and covered in sweat, Dibsy still gets awarded the winner’s belt in a light-hearted ceremony.It’s another encouragement dreamed up by Mike to give Dibsy the belief that he can win his personal battle of the bulge.His story — including his admission of weighing st rather than the st widely reported last week — has brought the UK’s obesity crisis into sharp focus.We are the third fattest nation in Europe, according to the World Health Organisation, and the North East, where Dibsy lives, is one of the most obese regions in the country.He has struggled with his weight all his le, and the death of his father from cancer when Dibsy was  didn’t help his increasing reliance on comfort-eating.Numerous efforts over the years to lose weight failed and his huge bulk now has a devastating effect on his le — he is single, he can’t get a job, he has to order specially-made clothes and when he goes on holiday he has to book two plane seats.Dibsy, , finally decided to act earlier this year when a heart scare landed him in hospital for a week and a doctor delivered the stark message: “Diet or die.”Married dad-of-three Mike heard about Dibsy’s plight and offered to take him under his wing for a year.He now puts him through his paces twice a day at his Mas Body Gym, in their home town of Middlesbrough, and provides all his meals from his newly opened healthy eating diner.Dibsy was consuming an alarming , calories a day — an average man needs around , — but was burning hardly any because he was so inactive.He is now down to , a day after ditching takeaways, booze and unhealthy snacks and, thanks to his new exercise regime, is burning , a day.The results are remarkable.On day one he couldn’t walk more than a few yards without getting out of breath.I joined him for a workout on day ten as he proudly announced: “I’ve lost ½st already.”The first exercise — just a warm-up, said Mike — involved flipping a huge, kg lorry tyre.Despite his weight, Dibsy isn’t lacking in upper body strength and he made it look easy — which it isn’t.We then moved on to pushing a metal sledge theof the gym and dragging it back the other way, with Mike holding on to make it harder.Then it was on to the kg slam ball session — hurling a medicine ball into the ground with as much force as you can.Next came smashing a sledgehammer on to the lorry tyre as hard as possible, as Mike yelled at us to do it harder.The innovative bootcamp exercises are designed in part to replicate the physical exercise people might do in their daily jobs, and are perfect for Dibsy.Mike, , explained: “He is too big for conventional gym equipment, so we need to get him doing something dferent.“You work with what you’ve got and using this equipment we have devised a set of exercises that put him through it without creating too much strain on parts of his body that can’t handle it yet.“We also have a heart monitor on him all the time which gives a real-time readout of his heart rate and calorie burn rate.“The strain on his heart is something we need to keep an eye on, soit gets too much we ease off and let him rest.“We also need to make sure he doesn’t overheat, sohe is getting a bit hot we use a leaf blower to cool him down.”By then we were both shattered, but there was little time for rest as Mike moved us into the boxing ring.“Don’t hit him too hard, Dibsy,” instructed Mike. “Or not at all ”, I suggested.Thankfully, Dibsy was just about done in — the heart monitor revealed he had burnt , calories that session — and I could keep him at arm’s .Afterwards he told me how he had got so heavy.He said: “I have never been skinny but the weight started really going on in my early teens.“I have never been sporty andmy mates went to the park for a kickabout I’d just sit it out because you are embarrassedyou can’t run around with them.“My family say that my dad dying of cancer at , when I was , had a big effect, but I’m not so sure.I wouldn’t blame my weight on that, it’s down to me and no one  that I am this size.“I have been seeing doctors and dieticians for years and my weight would go up and down.I lost st at one stage but it went back on.“People do say things in the street or stare and kids call me ‘Fatty’.That obviously hurts, so I go home and comfort-eat to make me feel better, which puts more weight on, which attracts more comments. It’s a vicious cycle.“I have had girlfriends and long-term relationships and I wouldn’t say I have lost them because of the weight.“But I am single now and being this size does affect that side of your le.“I knew I had to do something after I had my recent scare. It started when I began getting out of breath.It got worse and I could hardly breathe. It was terrying and I was taken to hospital.They said my heartbeat was all over the place. Normally they said they would give me some drugs and shock my heart so the beat gets back to normal.“But they had no idea how much drugs to give me — they were scared I wouldn’t wake up.So instead they gave me beta blockers and blood thinners and basically hoped I didn’t have a heart attack.“I was in hospital for a week and a doctor came round and told me I couldn’t keep doing this.“He saidsomething didn’t change, I was heading for an early grave. To see the look on my mother’s face when he said that was heartbreaking.I have never had a doctor be so straight with me before and I decided that this time I had to do it for real.“I didn’t know Mike but I had heard of his new diner which serves healthy food so I went down with my mum and got chatting to the staff.“He got to hear about my plight and messaged me to say he could help. The next day I went to see him and he asked me about my le and what I hoped to achieve.“It was pretty emotional when we talked about what the doctor had said. My mum said she didn’t want to bury her child and we all ended up in tears.“Mike agreed to help, both with an exercise plan and a meal plan. It was intimidating going into the gym for the first time. I have been to gyms before but it has never worked for me.“But at Mike’s gym everyone is so encouraging and wants me to succeed. And the support Mike gives me away from the gym is incredible. He texts me about  times a day to check I am OK.“One evening, a couple of days into my new exercise regime, I was at home and I messaged him to say I was struggling. It was a night that I’d usually have a takeaway and I was missing it.“Without a moment’s hesitation he said, ‘I’ll see you at the gym in ten minutes’. I said, ‘But the gym is closed’. He replied, ‘I own the gym — see you there’.“We did a -minute workout and I got home exhausted and went to bed, really pleased with myself.“It’s support like that which is getting me through. I want to learn to drive and get back into work.I used to work in a chemical plant but got laid off.Since then it has been impossible to get another job because of my size.BREAKFAST: Two sausage sandwicheswith a pint of FantaMID-MORNING SNACK: Packet of crispsLUNCH: Chicken sandwich with full-fat mayonnaise, packet of crisps, a pasty and bottle of CokeDINNER: Huge plateful of chicken curry, rice, naan bread and spring rolls – plus a ham sandwich while that meal is cooking.

Saudi slammed shut Qatar’s only land border and barred state-owned Qatar Airways from its airspace.For a nation that imported much of its food and goods, it might have been calamitous. Yet little Qatar — it is smaller than Yorkshire and expecting to host .million football fans in  — has fought back.In the lunar-like landscape  miles north of capital Doha is a farming complex where black and white Holstein cows munch fodder in air-conditioned sheds. All , of them were brought in from Germany, Hungary and the US since the blockade began.It’s led to bosses at Baladna Farm being hailed as the milk sheikhs.Its marketing manager Mark Somogyi tells me: “Before the blockade at least  per cent of dairy products were from abroad. Today Qatar is practically self- sufficient in fresh milk, as little as three per cent is imported. Nobody foresaw the blockade but the country is coping very well.”So what of the vast World Cup building preparations under the blockade, which sees most goods now arriving at Hamad Port In an exclusive tour, Qatari organising committee officials were keen to show stadium preparations were on schedule.Seven futuristic arenas are rising out of the desert with one revamped, aircon blasted ground — the Khala International — already finished.For this is the World Cup where money is no object. For brimming with petro dollars, Qatar is the richest nation on Earth. At the Al Wakrah Stadium, nine miles from Doha, the seats are already going in.Modelled on traditional dhow fishing boats, the ,-capacity stadium may host games up to the quarter final stage. The pristine pitch is like a green oasis amid the construction dust where , migrant workers toil.Inside what will be a players’ dressing room, Mohammed Emaran, , is sealing plasterboard where Gareth Southgate could be giving his team-talk in four years.The labourer — who earns around £ a month for a six-day week with free lodging and food — says: “I’m happy with the work and send money home to my family in India.”Yet two migrant workers have perished during construction work at the £million arena.Anil Kumar Pasman, , from Nepal, died at Al Wakrah after being hit by a lorry in . And a -year Nepalese scaffolder fell to his death on August . He is believed to be the first reported fatality at a tournament venue since January , when British construction worker Zac Cox, , died helping refurbish the Khala International Stadium.Yet one union has claimed , people have been killed working on projects for the  tournament, a claim vehemently denied by Qatari officials. Qatar’s World Cup organising body, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, says the Nepali scaffolder’s death is still being investigated.Project manager Thani Khala Al-Zarraa, , says of the latest tragedy: “Half an hour after I heard the news I gathered , workers at the stadium. I told them, ‘You came here to support your family, so whatever health and safety instructions we tell you is for your own good, so that you go back to your families’.“But in construction you cannot eliminate all risk. Mistakes happen.”Qatar’s £billion spend on World Cup infrastructure has eased the financial pain of the blockade for many of the .million population.Doha is currently a vast building site as new tower blocks rise and a three-line metro system is constructed. More than  greenhouses have been built in the desert amid hopes to become self-sufficient in vegetable production by .Some England fans had planned to stay in Dubai and fly in and out for the games. But direct flights have been canned under the blockade.The Middle East’s first World Cup will also have a shortfall of hotel rooms. But there are “glamping” sites in the desert while cruise ships moored in the Gulf will also provide accommodation.Yesterday Qatar was sweltering in the muggy, low Cs. But during the tournament — from November  to December  — it should be a balmy  to C. Still, a thirst-quenching beer might be out of the question.It is unclear what the rules on alcohol sales will be in a Muslim land under Sharia Law, where drinking in public is banned. Five-star hotels serve alcohol, but £ for a bottle of beer is commonplace.Budweiser told The Sun it will be an official sponsor at the Qatar World Cup — but can’t yet confirm whether it will be allowed to sell its beer at stadiums and fan festivals.Travelling supporters could also take in a camel race at the Al Shahaniya race track an hour outside Doha.After Qatar banned child jockeys in , the camels have been ridden by robots in racing silks.Another unusual sight is the desert scrapyard at Al Wukair, where around , vehicles, including cars, boats, lorries, buses, bulldozers and cranes, languish in the dust. organising committee boss Hassan al Thawadi insists: “The blockade hasn’t hindered our preparations. We had to find alternative suppliers . . .  and since then projects are still on track.”In Qatar’s beating heart, Doha’s Souk Waq market, locals have turned beating the blockade into a matter of national pride.World Cup replica hawker Ahmed Khala, , sells at least one £ le-size replica copy of the gold Fa trophy a day alongside tea mugs fashioned in the shape of niqab-clad women.Ahmed says: “Why didn’t they do a blockade before Qatar won the right to stage the World Cup  They’re jealous Qatar has the tournament.”If the blockade is still in place come , Three Lions fans will at least be guaranteed a decent cuppa.All thanks to the milk sheikhs of Arabia.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And he attacked Theresa May and her Chequers plan.But he says he’d still like to be Defence Secretary. Mr Mercer is an Afghanistan veteran who served with  Commando, part of the Royal Artillery, before becoming an MP. Since being elected he has joined the Defence Select Committee and campaigned for veterans, including those with mental health problems and others facing prosecution for alleged crimes during the Troubles. He took his Devon seat from Labour in  and increased his majority to more than , last year. He gained notoriety when it emerged he had appeared in a shower gel advertisement, in which he was shown soaping himself while half naked.  And just this week he was on a charity edition of Channel  game show Celebrity Hunted, for which he skipped a session of the Health Select Committee. Here’s a run-down of the most…honest answers he gave in the interview.  Asked how the Johnny Mercer who left the military in  would vote now, he said: “I wouldn’t go and vote. Just being honest, I wouldn’t vote. Of course I wouldn’t, no.” . He says hes not even surethe Conservative Party reflects his views any more  “There’s no doubt about it that my set of values and ethos, I was comfortable that it was aligned with the Conservative party. I’m not as comfortable that that’s the case anymore.” . He says the current situation is a s**t show  It’s very dficult because in my DNA I’m inherently a team player. “But when you go home from here on a Thursday and go for a run across Dartmoor or whatever, and you’re stripped to your core being, I mean, yeah, you realise it’s a s**t show. . And he definitely wouldnt be a Tory MPhe were joining the party now  “If the situation was like it is now, I can safely say there would be absolutely no chance that I would try and be a Member of Parliament.” . Heres what he said when he was askedhe wanted to be part of the current government team  Well no, of course not. “I’ve been, how do I say this… when I was asked to do a certain role and made it clear that I couldn’t for one reason or another, it was made very clear to me that… I can’t, I can’t. I mean, would I want to be part of this administration  No. . And he was very specic about whats stopping him  Look, I think it’s very clear that this current administration under this Chief Whip, under this Prime Minister, there is no role for people like me. That’s fine because nothing lasts forever.  My ambition here has always been to be Defence Secretary. I’d love to be a Defence Secretary who had ten years to rip apart that department, make it work, get the offer right to our young people. We are such an amazing, proud military nation. It’s really tough to see what’s going on now. . Andhe says hes ready for a s**t fight  Going forward, at the end of the day, above everything about being an MP, above being Johnny Mercer, any of this stuff, a Conservative or whatever, I’m a patriot. “I’m not going to sit at the back of the bus and watch it head towards the edge of the clf.

I speak for many more of my generation than you might think. I was born in , when my country was fighting for its le against Nazi Germany and it was not clear that we would win. My father Harry was in the RAF in the Middle East. My Uncle Bob was a tail gunner in Lancasters over occupied Europe.My Uncle Jack, a Guardsman, had been invalided off the beaches at Dunkirk. Even my youthful Auntie Barbara was in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. This was total war – the Americans fighting and dying with us, for our freedom. At home it was all wartime austerity. Food and clothes were rationed. Travel was suspended. I ask you to remember because so many have either forgotten or never known the cataclysmic reality of Europe at war with itself. Remember the Blitz on London and Hull. Remember Sheffield, Coventry, Plymouth, Liverpool, Bath and York. Remember, Auschwitz, Treblinka, and the other death camps where millions of Jews were exterminated. Remember El Alamein, Tobruk, Normandy and all the battlegrounds where people gave their lives to free us from Hitler.Remember all these things and consider thoughtfully what must be done to ensure that these horrors never happen again.  The EU brought peace, trade, co-operation and freedom to travel where there had been enmity, rivalry and refugees. It is not perfect, made up of all the flaws of the people of an old, culturally and racially erse continent that historically has more often been at war than at peace. But it is nothing short of a miracle that they found the wisdom to get together in their common interest. I do not care what Theresa May brings back from Brussels, just so long as it keeps us good friends and partners with the rest of Europe. I want the peace that my father’s generation fought for to be preserved in perpetuity, for my children, and generations to come. So, when Mrs May s with her Brexit package, I look to the politicians – including those Labour MPs who have the country’s real interests at heart – to support her in the hour of the nation’s need. At this critical time it is more important to vote for a new relationship with Europe than to blindly follow the elusive dream of Jeremy Corbyn in No. The crunch is coming and it will reveal the true patriots. Because of the war I did not see my father until I was three years old. But I was lucky. At least Sgt Routledge came home. So many others didn’t.

The APLE Collective – Addressing Poverty through Lived Experience – is not a think tank. It’s made up of real poverty experts – Universal Credit claimants from places like Stockton-on-Tees and Salford. People who want to know why, in five years since the controversial benefit was first rolled out, no one has bothered listening to them. “The Government needs to start listening to people actually on Universal Credit,” Diane Pottage, , of Stockton, one of the letter authors told me. “We keep hearing it’s working. Well, I’m sorry, it isn’t. Butyou listen to us, we can tell you how to fix it.” Tory Brexiteers blast Theresa Mays plot to keep Britain tied to the EU for longer than plannedHer solutions are: “Stop the rollout to any more places, and take time to listen to the people who are on it. Go back to fortnightly payments. Stop the five-week wait for help.” This week – after two ex-Prime Ministers attacked the benefit, and Esther McVey finally admitted “some people will be worse off” – leaked documents suggested the Government is desperately seeking solutions to stop UC becoming the new Poll Tax. Yet, the voices of claimants are still being routinely ignored. Meanwhile, the Government fought Labour tooth and nail in Parliament this week to avoid releasing its own impact assessments of how people have been affected. Ministers tampered around the edges – delaying the rollout of UC for those on existing benefits. But, of course, people in low-paid work are always becoming ‘new claimants’ as one precarious job ends and they need help while they find another one. Meanwhile, at least , people with existing claims will still be ‘migrated’ to UC during . That may seem a small numberyou don’t have children to feed. “My social safety net is gone because of Universal Credit,” another of the letter’s authors, Letitia Rose,  from West Yorkshire, said. “It’s not just the way the benefit works, it’s all the pathetic administrative errors.” The next day the Government admitted wrongly underpaying , disabled people to the tune of poundbn. Patricia, , told me she was actually working at the Jobcentre when the new benefit came in – before needing to claim UC herself when the contract ended. “It’s not better for people, it makes things worse,” she says. “I don’t think politicians would survive a week on Universal Credit, let alone a full year.” Campaigners have been inspired by events in Scotland, where claimants are being brought into the design of benefits. In April, the Scottish Social Security bill enshrined in law ideas that “social security is a human right” and that “respect for the dignity of iniduals” must be at the heart of Scottish social security. Most workers earn less than they did seven years ago when Tories came into power“This is not just about people saying how bad things are – it’s recognising they have the expertise needed to address poverty,” says Ruth Patrick, a lecturer in social policy and social work at the University of York, who works with benefit claimant group Dole Animators. People with experience of poverty are not just case studies to be wheeled out. They should have a seat at the policy-making table.” This week, the poverty experts held a string of events nationwide to mark the International Day for the Eradication of World Poverty. Diane helped run a stall at Stockton Market, urging people to share their experiences. Letitia was involved with similar events in Salford. Patricia spoke movingly at the House of Lords. And UC claimants took over @wiganpier, our Wigan Pier Project twitter account. Five years after UC started, Diane’s own story is bitterly familiar – a six-week wait for help, then a wrong payment. “I’ve been to a food bank twice before and I’m not very far from needing one again,” she says. “The system is broken. My mum and dad were both working class but they weren’t going to a food bank.” The APLE Collective has yet to hear back from McVey, but the DWP say it has received the APLE Collective’s letter and will respond “in due course”. It says that with Universal Credit people are getting into work faster and staying in work longer. A spokeswoman added that “through our ‘test and learn’ approach we continue to listen to feedback from stakeholders and claimants and make improvements to the system”. Yesterday, I dug out the DWP’s press release from the first rollout in April . “Universal Credit is nothing less than the start of a fundamental cultural sht of the welfare system,” it proclaimed. “This will revolutionise the way people experience the welfare state.” A revolution that has cost hopes, dreams, potential, and even lives.

The Prime Minister said she could extend the -month exit transition period for a matter of months in a desperate bid to smash the deadlock over the Irish backstop. EU chiefs welcomed the move but it triggered uproar among Leave campaigners who claimed it would delay the UKs real departure. The PM also issued a thinly-veiled warning to MPs set to vote against any deal she brings back from Brussels in the coming weeks. They should think about the importance of protecting jobs and livelihoods when they are faced with deciding on any exit deal, she said. Ministers want to deny the Commons the chance to amend the crunch motion, meaning MPs would be confronted with a take-it-or-leave-it choice between accepting any pact or crashing out without a deal. Speaking after a two-day summit in Brussels, Mrs May feared stalled talks would get even harder as teams near a deadline for sealing an agreement. She said: These were always going to be tough negotiations and they were always going to get tougher as we got to the closing stages. “There are some dficult issues we are still working through.”  This weeks crunch showdown had been earmarked for thrashing out a deal, two-and-a-half years after Britain voted to Leave. But those hopes were dashed at last months disastrous summit in Salzburg. However, Mrs May was boosted by support from fellow EU leaders in Brussels yesterday. Britain is due to leave the bloc on March . But the transition period to smooth the departure was due to run until December . Her controversial decision to take on her own backbenchers – who hold her premiership in their hands – by delaying the end date as key to winning backing from EU counterparts. But it would mean Britain pumping cash to Brussels and staying tied to bloc rules, including accepting an unlimited number of EU migrants.  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the “prolongation of transition period probably will happen – thats a good idea”. EU Council President Donald Tusk added: “If the UK decided an extension of the transition period would be helpful to reach a deal, I am sure the leaders would be ready to consider this positively.” But Tory MPs blasted the move.Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg branded an extension a poorly thought-through idea.He told Sky News: It could be very expensive to do. It is unknown as to whether this had approval from the Cabinet when it met earlier this week. But it also doesnt solve the problem of the backstop, because the backstop would remain, as far as one can tell, at the end of this additional transition. It seems to me to be a rather poor attempt at kicking the can down the road.  MP Nick Boles, a former Remainer and close ally of Environment Secretary Michael Gove, warned: Im afraid she is losing the confidence now of colleagues of all shades of opinion, people who have been supportive of her throughout this process.They are close to despair at the state of this negotiation because there is a fear that both the Government and the European Union are trying to run out the clock, that they are trying to leave this so late that they can credibly say there is no alternative but a no-deal Brexit and most people agree that would be chaos.That is not an acceptable way for a leader of a government to behave. Mr Gove told the Commons it was vital Britain leaves the EU at the earliest possible point. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said: The Prime Minister was very clear ... that she recognises the need to do things swtly, not least because that is what the public expects. That is what she deeply feels in terms of honouring the referendum result.” But EU chiefs hailed the offer, with Mr Tusk saying: “We are in a much better mood than after Salzburg. “What I feel today is that we are closer to final solutions and the deal. Its maybe more an emotional impression than a rational one but emotions matter in politics. Mr Junker predicted an extension probably will happen.

But she promised: “Because you made sacrices, better days are ahead.”  However, Stephen Clarke, of independant think tank the Resolution Foundation, told the Mirror the pay outlook is weak and that benefit cuts have only just begun to take effect. Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: “The figures graphically demonstrate that people have been working harder and getting poorer thanks to the Tories. “We are suffering from the most severe wage squeeze since the Napoleonic war.

He said: “I would strongly advise to be looking for houses which are green, which have low to zero energy bills. “It’s great financial resilience in your le and on a community-wide level it’s resilience to climate change.”  Kevin also revealed his interest in environmentally-friendly design which he hopes to promote He said: “When I invest I invest in renewable and ethical portfolios. “They may at the moment be yielding on par with conventional non-ethical investment but my belief is that in the future as the effects of global warning and climate change become more obvious to us all, these investments will start to make real sense and the same goes for a house. “Why would you spend more on a house that costs you pound, a year to heat  It’s just a waste of money.” "},{"url":null,"title":"halloween up high streets expect","story":"NewsHalloween is on the up as high streets expect a £million splurge on tricks and treatsHomes across Britain are expected to spend an average of £ on Halloween this year - more than ever beforeShareCommentsByRuki SayidConsumer Editor:,  OCT NewsOne in seven Brits buy a spooky outfit for Halloween \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHalloween is set to give the flagging high street a boost as we splurge poundmillion – up % on last year.

The detached home was built in  and very little inside has changed since, even most of the furniture are original pieces from the era.The keys to this distinct home in Cross Hands near Llanelli , called Heol Bryngwili, was handed to the first owners in the autumn of .And its remained in the same family until now. The current owners are reluctantly passing the keys on as they need to downsize, reports Wales Online. Even just walking up to the property you get a sense of the unique and historic home that awaits you. The classic art deco features are obvious the led crittall windows and symmetrical feel to the design, yet broken up by a curved wall and window and the inclusion of a first floor balcony. Once the outside is painted white, the home will look more Miami Beach than Cross Hands... Originally the house may have had a flat roof in the art deco style, but the pitched roof is definitely a bonus, avoiding any possible flat roof problems in the future. In through the glass led front door and the hall still has all the original woodwork, including a brilliant built-in telephone seating and storage area.The stair rail, wood block flooring and door pelmet all promote the classic dark wood interior design look of the era. Deep coving and skirting boards, and solid wood led interior doors throughout the home add to the s visual display. Into the front reception room and one of the stand-out features are the two crittall windows. Multi-led and including a leaded classic arrow design in one , these windows are an absolute must-have in an authentic art deco home. Over the windows are decorative window pelmets incorporating the classic stepped art deco design. This attention to detail illustrates how important the design of the home was to the builder and the family who then owned it. The feature tiled fireplace with accent black horizontal tiling is straight out of a s design book and has surely been the main gathering point for the family and visitors through the decades. The arched alcove above the fireplace again shows that art deco design was, and still is, an important aspect of this home.  As was common decades ago, this front room would have probably been considered as the parlour, the posh room reserved for visitors and important family gatherings. The most used room by all family members would most likely have been the rear sitting room. In this family room the atmosphere is more relaxed. The room still has the crittall windows, pelmets and decorative coving but the fireplace is arguably less flamboyant than the front room and the built-in cupboards suggest a multi-ing family room with the need for storage and bookshelves. This warm and cosy room still emanates the atmosphere of yesteryear and the le of a busy family using the space. Decades ago this room would have been the heart-of-the-home, not the kitchen diner as it is today.Updated during the s the kitchen in this house is small by todays standards. Although perfectly usable, there is scope for a new owner to create a spacious kitchen diner at the rear of the property by getting the sledgehammer out.There are a number of small rooms behind the kitchen that could be incorporated into the space and luckily few art deco features remain here to destroy. Theres a boiler room, side entrance hallway and pantry that could all become part of a modern kitchen diner. Hopefully the new owner will chose the kitchen design carefully to complement and pay homage to the art deco calibre of the home, rather than overwhelming it with contemporary design. Upstairs there are three good sized bedrooms, with the master at the front of the house having direct access on to the curved balcony.  But the star of the show on the first floor is undoubtedly the bathroom. The original green tiling including horizontal dark accent tiles is a s site to behold. It is rare to find a bathroom with tiling untouched by time. The bath may have been replaced at some point, its likely the original was a roll-top bath, but many other features remain. The arched canopy over the bath is a delight, as is the window pelmet, ceiling coving and s style basin and taps. The toilet is in a separate room next to the main bathroom, resulting in the main room feeling spacious. Outside there is a rear garden which could be considered large for a suburban property, plus a lawned area at the side. There is a garage and workshop at the back of the land. This frozen in time property has always been owned by the same family and ideally the vendors are looking for a buyer that will love the original art deco features and s style as much as they have. Theres even the possibility of some of the original furniture being included in the sale by negotiation. This truly unique property offers a new owner a choice to preserve all the originality that makes it a one-off home of distinction. It remains to be seen how much of it is loved and restored and what ends up in a skip outside. The house is on the market for pound, with estate agent Clee Tompkinson Francis Carmarthen branch.

According to a royal expert, even second-in-line to the thrown Prince William and we Kate Middleton dont legally have full custody of their three children - Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. This is because the family has an agreement with the Queen , which means she is granted full legal custody over all minor royals. Royal expert Marlene Koenig explained the rule to the Sun Online .She said: The sovereign has legal custody of the minor grandchildren.  Legislation passed during the reign of George I. It was known as The Grand Opinion for the Prerogative Concerning the Royal Family and it was about the King’s control over the education, the raising and the marriage of his grandchildren. He did it because he had a very poor relationship with his son, the future King George II, so they had this law passed that meant the King wasof his grandchildren. The law dates back more than  years to , a time when the monarchs right of supervision extended to his grandchildren and this right of right belongs to His Majesty, King of the Realm, even during their father’s letime. The Queen also had full custody of William and Harry when they were younger.This fact first came to light when Prince Charles and Princess Diana got orced in . In the couples orce agreement there was no mention of custody arrangements for the children, despite arrangements being made. This was because neither parent had full custody, instead this belonged to the Queen. This meant Charles and Diana had to get the Queens permission before doing simple things with their children, such as going on holiday. Marlene confirmed that the rule still exists today and technically the parents need the Queens permission to take their children out of the country. She added that despite this, the Queen is respectful of the wishes of the parents and wouldnt push her views upon them.

Harry said: “Men can help as well by getting involved, we have to.  “We need to get men’s voices involved as soon as possible.” His we, who has been a long-term advocate for women’s rights, told students that their projects, including making boxes of supplies for women in need, made her proud.

Anxious Beth Dance says she is now in crisis and needs a bigger home.The -year-old told Plymouth Live that her one bedroom property was adequate for her and husband Martin until April this year.But after her -year-old son Zac moved back in from living with her ex-husband in Exeter, it has been increasingly cramped. And in May she found she was pregnant. Last month -year-old daughter Chloe – who had also been living with her father in Exeter – unexpectedly appeared on Beth’s front door following disagreements with his current partner.  Beth said she had gone to the authorities for help, bidding on homes through Devon Home Choice as each additional child appeared, hoping to get first a two-bedroom flat, then a three-bedroom and perhaps even a four-bedroom. However, complications arose quickly, thanks to her own past, her husband’s past and the process itself. Beth explained how she would be allowed to bid on up to three properties, but had to wait for a suitable place to appear on the website. When a bid was put in, she would be “gridlocked” from bidding with new places, waiting for up to five weeks to learnthe bid was accepted or whether she was considered suitable for the property.  She explained how properties which are marked “sensitive lets” mean certain people cannot have them, but Beth claims some of the properties are not marked as such and she has repeatedly bid for these properties only to later be turned down on the basis that she is an unsuitable tenant. Beth said she accepts that Martins criminal record has become a factor, with him coming out of prison in March following a theft conviction. However, she points out they have been together for seven years, while she accepts Martin is a recovering drug addict. For her own part, due to a dficult period when she was living in Exmouth, she admits she “lost the plot” and was charged for criminal damage, having targeted her neighbours’ cars.  It resulted in her moving to Plymouth in the hope of the pair starting over. She said: “We decided to downsize from our four-bedroom place in Exmouth to a one-bedroom flat in Plymouth. We were adequately housed and then things changed. “We are now in crisis. “The children are sleeping on the floor in the living room on mattresses and we have to pull them into the room from our bedroom each night, then drag them back again in the morning. “Martin has COPD and we need a place that has gas-central heating. “I can’t even buy a cot for the baby because there’s nowhere to put it. “We’ve been told we may be waiting month months and I give birth in December. “All we need is a three bedroom place, or at least a two bedroom.  “I’m just getting turned down and turned down for properties.” “Devon Home Choice often advertise it wrong, saying it’s for anyone but then after you apply there are restrictions on who can take up the place. “One time we wasted five weeks of bidding for a property. “We were offered a place in Torquay but because of our circumstances we were later refused. “We keep having to go back to the drawing board. “We’re all boxed up and have been for months, we’re living out of boxes, ready to go when we finally get approval for a bigger place. “We’ve gone to Plymouth City Council but they couldn’t help. “It’s just a waiting game.”  Beth said she has even gone to MP Luke Pollard and her local councillor for help. She added: “I know people will say why have a baby but our circumstances changed by me taking in our other children. “If that hadn’t of happened then a move to a two bedroom would have been adequate. “I haven’t got the money to go private because I just done have the funds. “We’re trapped in this situation and I just want someone, anyone, to listen to me. Its just not fair on the children. They havent done anything wrong. ” Beth said she was able to get Zac – who originally went to an Exmouth school – into a new school in Plymouth, but is still struggling to get Chloe into any school. Beth said: “She’s been told she has to catch up on subjects she’s never even done before. “It’s all been a nightmare”. Steve Ford, PCH Head of Neighbourhoods, said: We have sympathy for Miss Dances situation and have explained Devon Home Choices banding and allocation process to her. Miss Dances situation highlights the lack of suitable affordable housing in Plymouth. This is something we are trying to address with our numerous developments around the city. We are continually seeking and acquiring sites to meet this demand so that we can help people in Miss Dances position.

Meghan Markle is only just beginning to show a hint of a baby bump, but speculation is already re about what the little tot will be called. And now Princess Dianas former butler, Paul Burrell has thrown his own suggestion into the ring, and its a memorable one.  Burrell, who has also worked as the Queens footman, took to Twitter to congratulate the couple on their pregnancy and comment on their royal tour. And while he was at it, the -year-old decided to urge the couple to be brave and name their child after Harrys late mother, Princess Diana. He wrote: Dear Meghan and Harry, Many Congratulations to you both on your wonderful news. Australia has taken you to their hearts and have seen at first hand the inspirational people you are.  He added: If your baby is a girl, be brave and call her Diana which would make your Mother so proud. However people were quick to disagree with him about the name suggestion. Many thought Diana would be proud, regardless of what the child is named, and some thought the unborn baby should forge her own path without her grandmothers legacy hanging over her head.  Im sure Diana would be proud no matter what they name their child. Its not about being brave. Shes left her own legacy in her boys. Its their le, to carve out as they wish to, commented one Twitter user. No, let the childa girl start le without that huge legacy hanging over her head, responded another. However some were on board with the name choice and thought it was a lovely idea. They said: Youre so right Mr Burrell they should do just that and next to Diana I think Victoria would be very meaningful for this child.

McCauley Cox, , was today found guilty of two counts of grievous bodily harm with intent after jurors heard he drove into a crowd after a fight broke out. Both women suffered serious injuries, Newport Crown Court was told, and Cox was warned he faces a tough sentence. Cox was previously convicted after leading police on a high-speed chase on the M and crashed through a barrier on the Severn Bridge. Judge Daniel Williams told Cox he would adjourn his sentencing until Friday morning, adding: You face a substantial sentence in a young offenders institute.  CCTV used in the trial shows Coxs car approaching a crowd of pedestrians outside the Courtyard nightclub on Cambrian Road, Newport, as some begin fighting in the early hours of April . The car clips one of the pedestrians, leading some to kick the Ford C-Max people carrier and confront Cox at either side of his vehicle. Moments later, the car darts forward and turns on to the pavement towards a group of people, including victims Sophie Poole and Emma Nicholls, who are sitting on a kerb.  Cox runs over the two girls before reversing back over them, then darting forward once more over their bodies and reversing further down the street. Witnesses begin to attack his car and smash its windscreen, prompting Cox to accelerate out of the road at speed, missing other pedestrians by inches. Police found the car nearby later that day having been set on fire.  Prosecutor James Wilson accused Cox of using his vehicle to deliberately run over a man who was trading blows with his friend, only to miss and repeatedly run over the two young women, who are in their early twenties. Mr Wilson said: You were using the car as a weapon. You know full well the reason you went for that man is because he was confronting a friend of yours. You deliberately drove that car at that man with intent to cause him very serious harm. And you are responsible for those girls injuries because of your anger and annoyance at that man who was confronting your friend. Witness Nathan Rumble said Cox hit the two girls like a speed bump, and said it appeared the driver intentionally drove his car into the crowd.  Mr Rumble said: It was wrong. He was going for them. You cant just hit someone twice and not know what you are doing. The two girls, who are friends from university, suffered really serious injuries after being repeatedly run over, with Miss Poole needing specialist skin grafts and Miss Nicholls suffering a lacerated spleen. Cox, from John Ireland Close, Newport, was remanded in custody. After the verdict, Kelly Huggins of the CPS, said: McCauley Cox used his vehicle as a weapon and caused an incident which left his victims with serious injuries. The CPS showed in court that his actions in driving his car into the crowd and reversing over those injured on two occasions amounted to this serious offence.Evidence included CCTV footage showing the incident and its aftermath where Cox showed no regard for those he had injured.Our thoughts are with the victims as they recover from their injuries."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco worker suing supermarket 20k","story":"NewsTesco worker suing supermarket for £k after colleague farted in his faceCustomer assistant At Masood is suing the supermarket chain for for harassment and race discriminationShareByKelly-Ann Mills:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsAt Masood is suing Tesco for £k \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Tesco worker who claims he was bullied because he was a Muslim is suing the company after a colleague “broke wind in his face”.

Kolbie Sanders turned heartbreak into generosity by offering up her pound, venue to strangers after she split with her fianceacute Skylar Cotton. The -year-old university student wrote on Facebook that she had just  hours to find a couple prepared to get married at the wedding venue. She was inundated with messages from hundreds of husbands and brides-to-be desperate to win her big day.  After whittling down the applicants to a shortlist of , Kolbie, from Lindale in Texas, US, plucked lucky winner Halie Hipsher, , out of a hat.

The mother of seven-month-old Riley will wed Matthew Jones, , an oil field worker, at the Belle Vue wedding venue in Tyler, Texas, this Saturday. And touchingly, Kolbie will be guest of honour. Kolbie, a student at the University of Texas at Tyler, called off her own wedding to Skylar, , an oil well worker, when she realised the passion had left their relationship.  She said: There was no scandal. We fell out of love and it didnt feel right to get married. We were together for four years and engaged for one and a half years but we grew apart. I woke up one day and realised I didnt want to marry him. We had both lost passion for one another. It was short notice but you cant get marriedyou feel it wont work out in the long run. The venue told me that I could still get married there at some point in the future and keep my booking but by that point I thought, Id like another couple to enjoy it. Skylar and I are still really good friends and he was on board with me donating the venue. She took to social media to find a betrothed couple to take the booking on October .  The elementary education major wrote on Facebook on Sunday: With my engagement ending, Ive come to find tremendous peace knowing that I did the right thing for both of us. With that being said, now I want to do the right thing by others and let some good come out of this decision. This is a long shot but since my wedding venue has been paid for in full already, I have decided to donate my venue valued at , to a couple to use for their wedding day! The catch: I have  hours to find the couple and they would need to be ready to get married on the date that my venue is booked for - this Saturday, October th! I have partnered with the venue and we are both excited to seewe can help a couple in need of making their wedding that much more beautul with a free venue.  This is for couples who cant afford a fancy venue or who are spending too much money on their kids to be able to afford a nice wedding. This is for couples who love each other and will continue to choose each other for the rest of their lives. Kolbie asked husbands and brides-to-be to send her details of their relationship and was followed with heartfelt messages from couples eager to tie the knot. Her generosity was soon matched by a local photographer, caterer, florist, hair stylist and makeup artist who offered their services to the winning couple. She said: I couldnt even count the messages, I got hundreds and hundreds. I stayed up until am reading them all.  I didnt think Id have to choose from so many people. It was dficult to compare their stories. I knew Id never be able to decide so I picked the ones that stood out and wrote them down. I reached out to them all to make sure they were  per cent sure that they could get married in a week. She compiled a shortlist of  couples and placed their names in a bowl before plucking Halies name out of the bowl on Monday. Halie said: Thank you. I cant say that enough. Ill probably be saying it , times. I am beyond excited and thrilled but I have to be honest, Im a little nervous. We were planning for next fall so it was all kind of planned in one week. She is of course delighted that her ailing grandfather will be in the congregation watching his granddaughter marry Matthew.  She said: This is more than a love story between two love birds, but also a love story between a girl and her pawpaw. There will be another guest of honour at the wedding: the original bride-to-be.

Police launched a hunt for the woman, who was seen yanking the two-year-old boy by his arm to the house in a suburb of Houston, Texas. She then rings the doorbell and runs away before getting into her car and driving off and leaving the tot at the scene, in Spring. The bizarre incident, which lasted less than  seconds, was captured on the doorbell surveillance video, authorities said.  Neither the woman nor the child has been named, although police know their identities, the Montgomery County Sherfs Office said. The woman could face charges of felony child endangerment. A woman who answered the door raised the alarm after she found the child, who she had never seen before, along with two bags and no adult.  The toddlers mother had asked a friend to drop him off with his father in Spring because she was in the hospital, Montgomery County Sherf’s Lt. Scott Spencer said. Spencer said the friend left the boy on the front step Wednesday night without waiting for anyone to open the door. The boys father, who lives next door, told police he didnt realise what had happened until news crews showed him footage from his neighbours video doorbell the next morning. He told police he received a text message from the child’s mother saying his son would be dropped off at his house on Wednesday afternoon.

They said they also felt something cold on their backs. The couple, both , were on a trip to Belfast in Northern Ireland when they visited the city’s Robinsons pub. But after the pair, from Devon, snapped a romantic shot together they were horried to spot a spooky face right behind them. And they believe it bears a great resemblance to the ship’s captain, Edward John Smith.  Cake maker Cheryl, a mum-of-two, said: “My mother in law took three photos of my husband and I, all of them within seconds. “It was a bit cold at our backs, but we didn’t see or feel anyone behind us. “It was only when we flew back to England and when I was looking at the photos that I noticed something blurry. “I called my husband and he said it was probably a person walking behind us very fast. “But the thing is, everything around us is crystal clear apart from that blur. “I was very skeptical at first but now I really think it looks like a man. “There is a strong ‘Titanic’ background in the bar, and the more you look at the more he resembles the captain. “On the right hand side behind us a band was playing, so he looks ashe is watching the band.”  Cheryl and Luke visited Belfast with Luke’s parents over the summer and had met some friends for a few drinks on July , when the picture was taken. The second bar they visited was the Robinsons, a pub famous for its Titanic vibe as it features items recovered from the wreckage including letters and postcards written on board, first and second class china used on all White Star Line vessels and a Philomena doll. The image has just been released for the first time after Cheryl enlisted the help of ghost-hunting group Paranormal Investigations UK, who analysed the picture and ran a series of tests to confirm it was genuine.  Cheryl added: “I was intrigued, I simply wanted some answers. “When I got the report back from Paranormal Investigations UK I was freaked out, as they said the picture was  per cent unexplained. “I was left with more questions than answers. “I phoned Robinsons to tell them what happened, but they said nothing like it had been reported before. “My children were fascinated – I showed them the photo and explained to them that whatever is in that photo is not meant to be there and then we all watched ‘Titanic’ together- they didn’t know what it was or that it was a real ship. “After watching the film, my daughter Yasmin pointed out the face in the picture saying ‘look mum, it’s the Captain’. “I literally got goosebumps, because I had not told them anything about it looking like the captain. “I was excited and creeped out at the same time – she is adamant is the captain in the picture.

The fossilised remains of the prianha-like fish has sharp teeth it used to attack other fish. Scientists say the remarkable bony fish lived in the sea at the same time as the dinosaurs roamed the earth. They say they would bite off chunks of flesh from other fish. And researchers have even found the victims.  Other fish that had apparently been nibbled on, were found in the same limestone deposits in the quarry of Ettling in Germany. Study co-author Professor David Bellwood, of James Cook University in Australia, said: We have other fish from the same locality with chunks missing from their fins. This is an amazing parallel with modern piranhas, which feed predominantly not on flesh but the fins of other fishes. Its a remarkably smart move as fins regrow, a neat renewable resource. Feed on a fish and it is dead nibble its fins and you have food for the future. The fish, described in the journal Current Biology, is part of the renown collections at the Jura-Museum in Eichst tt.  It comes from the same limestone deposits that contained Archaeopteryx, a transitional fossil between dinosaurs and modern birds. The international research team said that the tooth pattern and shape, jaw morphology, and mechanics suggest a mouth equipped to slice flesh or fins. Thay say the evidence points to the possibility that the early piranha-like fish may have exploited aggressive mimicry in a striking parallel to the feeding patterns of modern piranha. Study co-author Dr Martina K lbl-Ebert, drector of Jura-Museum Eichst tt, said: We were stunned that this fish had piranha-like teeth. It comes from a group of fishes, the pycnodontids, that are famous for their crushing teeth. It is like finding a sheep with a snarl like a wolf. But what was even more remarkable is that it was from the Jurassic. Fish as we know them, bony fishes, just did not bite flesh of other fishes at that time.  Sharks have been able to bite out chunks of flesh but throughout history bony fishes have either fed on invertebrates or largely swallowed their prey whole. Biting chunks of flesh or fins was something that came much later. Prof Bellwood said: The new finding represents the earliest record of a bony fish that bit bits off other fishes, and whats more it was doing it in the sea. So when dinosaurs were walking the earth and small dinosaurs were trying to fly with the pterosaurs, fish were swimming around their feet tearing the fins or flesh off each other. The researchers described the new find a staggering example of evolutionary versatility and opportunism.

He has not been seen since entering the building - with reports claiming he was butchered alive by a -strong hit squad who tore his fingers off. Audio footage allegedly captured his agonised screams as his killers spent seven minutes murdering him and dismembering his body with a bone saw. On the day he vanished, a cheerful Mr Khashoggi had travelled to the consulate with his Turkish fianceacutee, Hatice Cengiz, who waited outside.  And despite having no foreboding of what was to come, he gave his partner a clear instruction before going inside the building.He told me to alert the Turkish authoritiesI did not hear from him soon, Hatice wrote in a New York Times opinion piece at the weekend.Had I known it would be the last time I would see Jamal, I would have rather entered the Saudi consulate myself. The rest is history: He never walked out of that building. And with him, I also got lost there. Mr Khashoggi, a US resident, had been visiting the consulate to obtain marriage documents that would enable him to wed his fianceacutee.  He was cheerful the morning we were going to the Saudi consulate to get a document certying his orce, explained Hatice. She added that she decided to skip university and travel to the consulate with her partner, who had been told to be there at pm. During their journey, the couple discussed their plans for the rest of the day, including having dinner with their friends and family. However, they would never make the dinner - for Mr Khashoggi never emerged from the consulate, according to his fianceacutee. Since his disappearance - which has made headlines across the world - Hatice has found herself questioning whether he is still alive.  In the opinion piece, published on Saturday, she said she had found herself thinking that Jamal and I are no longer in the same world. Turkish officials have said they have recorded evidence that Mr Khashoggi was assassinated by hitmen who flew in on a private jet.They believe his body was then removed - with one Turkish source claiming the journalist was chopped up on a table while still alive.However, the Saudis have strongly denied the allegations, insisting that he left the consulate safely on the day he was last seen. This week, a Turkish pro-government newspaper published details from audio recordings purportedly documenting Mr Khashoggis murder.  Yeni Safak reported that his torturers severed his fingers during an interrogation, and that the journalist was killed within minutes. According to the report, he was later beheaded and dismembered. Yesterday, a New York Times report cited a senior Turkish official confirming the details published by Yeni Safak. It has been claimed that members of the alleged hit squad listened to music through earphones as they dismembered their victim.A Turkish source, who has allegedly listened to an audio clip of the incident, earlier told Middle East Eye : They had come to kill him. Mr Khashoggi was said to have been dragged from the Consul Generals office into his study next door, where he was dumped on a table. Loud screams could then be heard - which only stopped when he was injected with an unknown substance, according to the source. Moments later, his body was allegedly cut up - while he was still alive.Earlier, a source told Sky News that one line of inquiry is that a very fast-acting chemical acid was then used to dissolve the journalists body parts.Turkey has said there are  suspects in the case - allegedly including forensic evidence expert Salah Muhammad al-Tubaigy, dubbed Dr Death. The MEE source claimed that Tubaigy listened to music via earphones as he cut up the reporters body while he was still breathing. He allegedly advised his accomplices to do the same.  When I do this job, I listen to music. You should do [that] too, Tubaigy could be heard saying in the recording, the source said. According to Yeni Safak, Mr Khashoggi was told to shut up at one point during his ordeal, which also allegedly saw his head cut. Earlier this week, another suspect in the Turkish police probe into the case was confirmed as Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a Saudi diplomat. It is thought Mutreb may have worked as a bodyguard for Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, whom he travelled extensively with.He used to work as a diplomat at the Saudi Embassy in London, according to the New York Times , which said several other suspects have been linked by witnesses and records to Bin Salmans security detail. The newspaper stated that at least nine of the suspects worked for the Saudi security services, military or other government ministries. It is alleged they flew out the same day as the killing, and brought a bone saw with them for the purpose of cutting up Mr Khashoggis body. Records allegedly show that two private jets chartered by a Saudi firm arrived and departed from Istanbul on October . Mr Khashoggi has so far been missing for  days. The Washington Post columnist was critical of the Saudi government, calling for reforms. He had worked at the Saudi embassies in Washington, US, and London, and was well-liked by both fellow journalists and diplomats. He was described by one as a warm and funny man. According to Dexter Filkins, writing for The New Yorker , the journalist was also loyal to his principles and refused to compromise his values.This prompted the Saudi government, in , to silence him, claims Dexter, adding that Mr Khashoggi fled to the US last year. Yesterday, US President Donald Trump said he did not want to abandon close ally Saudi Arabia over the journalists disappearance, and he needed to see evidence to prove Turkish claims he was killed by Saudi agents. Mr Trump said he was waiting for a full report on what had happened to Mr Khashoggi from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whom he has sent to Saudia Arabia and Turkey to meet with officials over the incident. This is despite US lawmakers having pointed the finger at the Saudi leadership and mounting Western pressure on Riyadh to provide answers. Last Saturday, a Turkish newspaper reported that recordings made on Mr Khashoggis Apple Watch - had been uncovered by investigators.  These recordings allegedly indicated he was tortured and killed, but the report in the Sabah daily could not immediately be veried. “The moments when Khashoggi was interrogated, tortured and murdered were recorded in the Apple Watch’s memory,” the paper said. It added that the watch had synched with the journalists iPhone, which Hatice was said to be carrying outside the consulate. But tech experts say it is highly unlikely the watch could have recorded actions inside the embassy and uploaded them to an iCloud account. Mr Khashoggis disappearance has provoked an international outcry against Saudi Arabia, the worlds top oil exporter.

I thought it was a good performance, especially in the first half.“It didn’t feel like a - defeat, so it was a bit disappointing coming off with that scoreline but it was good to get the goal at the end.”The former Partick Thistle and Wigan centre-half has been pleased with his own progress in the blue of Scotland lately after picking up his third cap.He hopes that, alongside defensive partner McKenna, there are many more to come in the months and years ahead as Alex McLeish’s side look to get their Nations League campaign back on track as they travel to Albania and Israel come to Hampden next month.“In my first two caps I think I played very well and again last night, apart from near the end where I gave the ball away and it led to a goal, I thought I had a solid performance.“I’m taking everything in my stride, trying to keep learning and, hopefully, building on it.

I’m really thankful to him for giving me it and, hopefully, I took it and did well.“Now we want to follow it up with another good performance against Inverness this week.”McMullan’s sparkling display saw him at the centre of much of United’s attacking display. He also grabbed an assist for the winning goal when Jags keeper Cammy Bell couldn’t hold his shot, allowing Pavol Safranko to net the rebound, making a mockery of last month’s revelation that United were willing to let him go in the summer.At the time he stated his plan was to get his head down and work hard to get back in the side before re-assessing his position during the January transfer window, when he’d be into the last six months of his contract.On that score, nothing has changed but, having been given his chance by the new boss, his hope is regular involvement from now on will see the matter resolved by a new deal at United.And he knows the best way to earn that is via regular performances like his last.“I’ve always had the belief in my ability and what I have to do is keep trying to play well.“On Saturday the manager gave me a more central role and it was good fun. You get a wee bit more of the ball and, when you do get on it, you can go both ways and I enjoyed that.”Even after just a few days working with Neilson, the -year-old is firm in his belief, what’s about to unfold at Tannadice is something every player there will want to be part of.“I think Saturday was a sign of things to come and we’re only going to get better from now on.“All the boys are champing at the bit to be involved and that’s definitely what you want because we’ve got a lot of good players here.“Right from the start on Saturday I thought we looked really good, we were creating chances. One thing where we were maybe lacking was converting them and it’s something we can work on.“But we did create a few, maybe should have had another couple of goals and we had one that was just offside as well and it’s good we’re making them.“We had to battle for the last  minutes or so and you do get a bit nervy when they pull a goal back and because it’s late on you go a bit more defensive.“Probably the fact we’d been so much on top makes you more anxious because you don’t want to throw away two points but we stuck together and saw the game out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sunderland target glen kamara could be bound for euros after scoring first finland goal","story":"Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara could be on his way to the next Euros after helping Finland to another impressive victory.Kamara’s last-minute goal on Monday night – his first for his country – clinched a - victory over Greece in the Ratina Stadium in Tampere.It leaves the Finns with a perfect record after four games and just needing a single point from their final two matches to confirm they’ll top their four-team group.The -year-old – linked with Sunderland at the weekend – came on as a second half sub in a - win over Estonia on Friday night before getting the full  minutes against the Greeks.As well as more than playing his part in helping his nation to their latest successes, that game time should be of benefit to Dundee.Kamara, last season’s star man at Dens Park, has been struggling with an ankle problem since July.He has been back for the Dark Blues’ last three league outings and will have benefited from the extra action while most of his clubmates were having the weekend off.Kamara will be back in time to complete preparations for Saturday’s trip to face in-form Livingston, as should Benjamin Kallman.The striker has also been back in Finland, with their U  squad.They are due in European Championship action against Lithuania tonight.The -year-old wasn’t involved when the Finns, who have no chance of qualying, went down in a home clash with Georgia at the end of last week."},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united fans right to be smiling at clubs new beginning","story":"If there’s a group of fans in the country who don’t need warned about  dawns, it has to be those at Dundee United.Since their team was relegated the best part of two-and-a-half years ago, Arabs have seen things look good for a time under Ray McKinnon and the same thing repeated under Csaba Laszlo.In the months that followed, however, optimism turned to frustration as the Tangerines went reasonably close to promotion back to the Premiership, but ultimately failed to secure it.Particularly in the case of McKinnon, that was not all his fault, and with hindsight he should probably have been given more time to get United back up to the top ision.That’s a story for another day as now the focus among fans is very much on how Robbie Neilson, their club’s fth manager in three years, is going to do.Past early promise that led to heartache, however, is why, despite an excellent opening victory against Partick Thistle at Firhill on Saturday, many will remain cautious and not yet be getting carried away about what the new gaffer is going to achieve.That’s understandable and right, because never mind once, this is a case of twice bitten, third time shy.Fans have the right to wait for events of the coming months to unfold before decidingNeilson, while without question the obvious choice as manager, is indeed the man to lead United back to the Premiership.What they can be is encouraged by the start he made at Thistle. For the first time in a while, there was a spark and energy about the team that suggests they have the quality to mount a strong and successful promotion challenge.Having suggested that, through no fault of Neilson or his players, this was maybe not the best game on which to judge them.While United’s play for most of the proceedings was excellent, there is no doubt in Thistle they were facing a beleaguered outfit that looks to still be coming to terms with a relegation.Two games against the Tangerines this season have seen them well-beaten and fortunate the margin of their defeats were not considerably greater. They are in the process of finding a new manager to replace Alan Archibald and it’s clear the man who comes in has a very big job on his hands.As the old adage goes, however, Neilson and his players could only beat what was put in front of them and in his first game in charge victory was achieved in some style.And aspects of the performance mean Arabs do have good reason to feel optimistic about their team’s prospects.After just a few days working with the new boss, Saturday saw a United team that looked reinvigorated and one that, apparently, had a clear idea of what the game plan was. Too often that was not the case under his predecessor Laszlo.That produced a top performance and fine inidual displays, not least from man-of-the-match Paul McMullan.Less than two months ago it appeared his time at Tannadice could be up. On the evidence of his display at Thistle, the former Scotland U  could now be ready to show why McKinnon battled so hard to get him.Andthe work he, and others, did on the ball gave plenty of reason to look forward to the games that lie ahead, so too did the ferocious way the entire team battled to get it back when Partick had possession.Particularly under Laszlo, opposing teams were given too much time in possession, but now United look like a side that will get the ball back quickly.It’s why, while not getting ahead of themselves, United fans can again feel hopeful about their team."},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie this is why dundees neil mccann experiment went horribly wrong","story":"That Neil McCann’s turbulent time as Dundee manager has ended can’t come as a surprise after what’s been a disastrous start to the season.And it’s fair to say his reign will go down as an experiment, however bold and well-thought out, that went horribly wrong.When the former Dens favourite was appointed manager on a temporary basis following Paul Hartley’s sacking in April last year, a few eyebrows were raised.Although McCann had the coaching qualications required, the fact was, apart from a brief spell as first-team coach at Dunfermline when more often than not he couldn’t attend games, he had no managerial experience.He was, of course, still very much in the football public’s eye via his work as Sky TV’s top Scottish football pundit.And a very good job he did, talking eloquently and providing expert analysis of the satellite broadcaster’s coverage of the game north of the border.As most managers will tell you, in football, theory and practice are two very dferent things. So it’s proved with the former Scotland star at Dens Park.That he had very definite ideas on how the game should be played was clear, as was the fact he was unlikely to change them.He demanded his team focused on a passing game all over the pitch, making it clear he’d accept responsibilityit meant risks taken in playing the ball out from the back at times led to goals being conceded. Inevitably it did.In fairness to McCann, his arrival did bring about a speedy and necessary improvement and wins over Motherwell and Kilmarnock followed by a draw with Ross County were enough to save the team from relegation in the   season.Two defeats would follow before the end of the campaign and while they were largely irrelevant to a relieved support, they did perhaps suggest to the caretaker boss that, long-term, the changes he wanted to make were going to be too big an ask.That led to a confusing summer that initially saw him announce he did not want the job, moves be made for then-St Mirren boss Jack Ross, before McCann had a change of mind and was appointed on a permanent basis.Crucially, that saw time wasted in undertaking what was a clearly necessary rebuilding of the squad. That left him playing catch-up when it came to new signings.It meant despite talk of better to come, with the exception of a brief spell around February, hopes of a top-six challenge gave way to another battle for survival.It was achieved via three wins from the first four post-split fixtures but, even so, it was clear better was expected this season.Another summer of signings this year gave some hope that would be the case but, although progression from the Betfred Cup group stage was secured, a home defeat at the hands of Championship Dunfermline and a lack of goals were worrying.Performances in opening league games against St Mirren and Aberdeen were decent but both ended in defeat.Then an inept and ill-disciplined display against Ayr in the last  of the Betfred Cup that saw three goals conceded and two red cards had the alarm bells ringing.After that the defeats continued coming. There was brief respite via a solitary success at Hamilton last month but he departs having lost eight of his last nine fixtures.If that was not bad enough, his time in charge saw stories of discord in the dressing-room and bust-ups with ious players during his time in charge didn’t help.Most notably was the argument that led to star goalie Scott Bain’s time at Dens coming to an abrupt end. Now McCann and assistant Graham Gartland have paid the price."},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"Swindonrsquos own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the thAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

The course has a good hill in it and I seem to do better on undulating courses.“But looking beyond that, I’d really like to do another marathon next year.“I’m not sureit’s too early to be thinking about that, but I’m keen to try.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 34","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.There was some suspicion over the intentions of health and social care managers at the recent meeting of Mid Argyll Health and Care Forum .Members felt their recent behaviour might be a precursor to changing the forum set-up to make it saferand more homogenised across the region.But there was also strong feeling the HCF should be better attended by public representatives such as community councillors.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"new eaterie chip 25 new","story":"NewsNew eaterie will chip in with  new jobs in PerthInvestment for the cityShareByDouglas Dickie:,  OCT NewsAlessandra Vareseat the Blue Lagoon in Ayr - this will soon be a familiar sight in Perth\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe opening of an iconic fish and chip restaurant in Perth city centre could create around  jobs for the city, the PA can reveal.

Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13420214.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_asr_ayp_031018gin1.jpg","title":"world wonder through looking glass","story":"NewsWorld of wonder through the looking glass at Hendricks GinIt’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsWhere the magic happens Hendricks Gin Palace \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“A gin made oddly”– put simply by the gin gods themselves – Hendrick’s.

William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring

We will seek public opinion following the pilot period.The East Lothian CityTree has been funded by the Scottish Government through the East Central Scotland Vehicle Emissions Partnership and has been installed in the designated Air Quality Management Area of Musselburgh High Street for an initial four-month pilot period.Councillor Norman Hampshire, cabinet member for environment, added: ldquoIt is particularly appropriate that we are installing this CityTree at the start of Climate Week Scotland  and it will be interesting to see what impact it will have on air pollution in Musselburgh High Street.\"A number of measures have been outlined in the Musselburgh Air Quality Action Plan to tackle poor air quality including introducing new technology, aiming to reduce vehicle emissions, and encouraging sustainable travel options.\"Whether as an inidual, business or school, we can all play a part in taking action to improve our environment and I hope the CityTree will act as a focus for future ideas.The installation powers itself via solar , and rainwater is collected and automatically redistributed using a built-in irrigation system. This provides ideal conditions for the mosses to grow in an urban environment.East Lothian is the second local authority in Scotland to have a CityTree, following Glasgow City Council.CityTree technology has also been installed in Berlin, Paris, Brussels, Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Oslo, London and Newcastle."},{"url":null,"title":"cockenzie-hearing-told-substation-could-jeopardise-hundreds-of-jobs","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Limitedwants to bring energy from their offshore windfarm onto land via a substation on the site of the former Cockenzie Power Station.But the local authority and community councils claim the substation should be sited at a less prominent site, where it could be hidden.They say putting the substation on the coastal site will hamper their ability to market the surrounding land which has the potential to create more than , jobs.The planning application for the substation was called in by Scottish Ministers in March this year ndash a month after East Lothian Council bought the land from ScottishPower.Housing and Planning Minister Kevin Stewart was in Cockenzie to open new affordable housing built next to the former power station site, as a public hearing was being held less than a mile away into the ICOL proposal.He called in the planning application in March this year as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China where she met representatives from ICOLrsquos parent company Red Rock.The Scottish Government appointed Reporter Allison Coard called the hearing so she could hear arguments from both side.ICOL said it believed that under current Government policy, which safeguards the site for energy use , their proposal was the ldquo best use of the land.However Ray Montgomery, who has been appointed as project manager for the Cockenzie site by the local authority, branded their claim ldquoridiculous.Mr Montgomery, who was head of infrastructure at the council, told the Reporter the land had potential for huge economic development in the area and the coastal location ICOL wanted to use was the ldquojewel in its crown.He told Ms Coard: ldquoI am concerned thatthis goes through the scale of the development is not compatible with our efforts to bring forward greater employment on that site.ldquoIt is ridiculous to suggest that a power station which employed  people and generated poundmillion a year being replaced with a substation which will employ seven people is best use of the land.A vision for the future of the site was produced on behalf of the council last year after  months of consultations with the local communities.The Cockenzie Masterplan foresees , jobs being created on the former power station site and surrounding landit is developed as it proposes.Ambitious proposals have also been put forward by Prestonpans Community Council for a cruise terminal at the coastal part of the site, while Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council want a marina developed on it.ICOL, which was represented by solicitor Robin Hutchison from international law firm Cameron McKenna Nabarro Olswang, Simon Herriott from Savills, as well as members of the windfarm team, dismissed the proposals put forward by communities for the site as ldquotheoretical.They insisted their substation was the lsquoonlyrsquo project on the table for the site, urging the Reporter not to consider either community council idea.Mr Hutchison told the Reporter: ldquoThe point to take away is that there is no evidence of alternative uses for the site.East Lothian Council and the community councils argue that an alternative site on a less prominent part of the site away from the shore would be better.The local authority argues that ldquobest use of the land would not be served by building the substation on the coastal site, which is seen as a prime attraction for marketing the enire area to future investors.ICOL has confirmed the substation, once built, would only require two employees to visit a few times a year for maintenance.A revised drawing of how it would look on the site which showed the space used reduced sparked anger from community councillor Brian Hickman, representing Cockenzie and Port Seton.He pointed out it was completely dferent to a revised drawing shown to his community council last month which promised something ldquomuch smaller when they were told the land needed would be lsquoshrunkrsquo from  hectares to  hectares.Mr Hickman told the hearing: ldquoI have lost confidence in this application because, in many respects, I do not think you know what you are doing or trying to achieve.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said the local community needed jobs.He said: ldquoWe do not have a lot of local employment and that is what we need.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

Enough is enough.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

These include the design of stealth drones advocated by defence companies such as BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin.The discovery, which confirms the common plant among the natural worldrsquos best fliers, shows movement of air around and within its ldquoparachute-shaped bundle of bristles often enables seeds to travel half a mile or more, kept afloat entirely by windpower.Gardeners generally dislike dandelions as they are viewed as weeds which have huge taproots that break easily when being removed.It can also regenerate from the tiniest piece to four times the size of what gardeners were trying to remove in the first place.The featherweight seeds carry on the lightest breeze and lodge themselves into every crack in the ground and every millimetre of bare soil.:Drone ban for children proposedDandelion pollen is not particularly nutritious, compared with that of clover and vetches, but it is available when little  is about.From March to November it offers a reliable source of food for all species of bees, beetles, butterflies and hoverflies.Now researchers from Edinburgh University have carried out experiments to understand why dandelion seeds fly so well, despite their parachute structure being largely made up of empty space.The findings show the seeds could be used in helping design under-the-radar technology such as drones for spy missions by the security services.The study revealed that a ring-shaped air bubble forms as air moves through the bristles.This enhances the drag that slows each seedrsquos descent to the ground.The newly found form of air bubble, which scientists have named the separated vortex ring, is physically detached from the bristles and stabilised by air flowing through it.Researchers found that the amount of air is critical for keeping the bubble stable and directly above the seed in flight, and is precisely controlled by the spacing of the bristles.The flight mechanism of the bristly parachute underpins the seedsrsquo steady flight and is four times more efficient than a conventional parachute.Scientists say the dandelionrsquos porous parachute may inspire the development of small-scale drones that require little or no power.Such drones could also be useful for remote sensing or air pollution monitoring.:New dandelion find on St Kilda#They hope their findings can be used to help engineering and sustainable technology fields.Dr Cathal Cummins, of the universityrsquos Schools of Biological Sciences and Engineering, who led the study, said: ldquoTaking a closer look at the ingenious structures in nature, like the dandelionrsquos parachute, can reveal novel insights.BAE Systems recently unveiled an aircraft design that is viewed as a major advance in stealth technology.The Magma drone does away with aircraft control surfaces, which has resulted in an aircraft whose shape remains constant throughout its flight.The small demonstration aircraft, which has completed a successful first flight, uses blown air to change direction instead of complex mechanical controls.Most aeroplanes look unmoving in flight, like a wing hanging off a giant tube flying through the sky.But conventional aircraft use a system of elevators, rudders and ailerons to control their direction in the pitch and roll directions.:Drone photography poses risk to wildle - expertsThese mechanical devices are usually in the shape of control surfaces attached to the rear of the wing, horizontal and vertical stabilisers and are controlled by the pilot ndash or sometimes an onboard flight computer.Control surfaces have been an instrumental part of aircraft since the early th century. These mechanisms can and do fail, limiting an aeroplanersquos manoeuvrability.But among a new generation of stealth warplanes, control surfaces can also affect an airplanersquos carefully shaped stealth profile, as the fin-like device moves upward or downward, momentarily making the aircraft slightly more visible to radar.Now the Edinburgh University researchers are hopeful that the dandelion seeds can help advance the technology further.The study, published in science journal Nature, was funded by the Leverhulme Trust and the Royal Society."},{"url":null,"title":"dublin-offers-to-extend-the-transition-period-may-has-not-ruled-it-out","story":"The countrys deputy prime minister Simon Coveney reacted positively to reports that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier was open to pushing the implementation period back a year to end in December .UK Government sources insisted Downing Street was not calling for an extension to transition arrangements which is not an outright rejection.The offer will enrage Brexiteers who will argue it would keep the UK effectively in the single market and customs union for at least another year with British taxpayers continue to pay over billions of pounds to EU coffers.Plus, it would enrage UK fishermen as it would mean the country would not take back control of its waters until December  at the earliest more than five years after the  EU vote.Theresa May is preparing for what is likely to be a fractious Prime Ministers Questions in the Commons before she travels to Brussels for talks with Donald Tusk, the European Council President, and before she addressed EU leaders ahead of an EU dinner.There are growing concerns the two sides will be unable to bridge the gap over the key issue of agreeing a \"backstop\" deal to ensure there will not be ato a hard border in Ireland when the UK quits the EU.Mr Coveney told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"What Michel Barnier is now suggesting is, look, lets ensure that the backstop is never likely to be used by creating the space and time for the UK and the EU to be able to negotiate UK-wide customs arrangements that can ensure that there wont ever be the need for customs checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.\"We have always said that we are happy to show flexibility in terms of how we get to a destination where-by there is a backstop, or an insurance mechanism, in place to reassure people on the island of Ireland that they are not going to see the re-emergence of physical border infrastructure.\"And what Michel Barnier has indicated very clearly is that the EU side, certainly, is willing to allow more time in the transition period to agree an alternative solution to a backstop.\"The EU meeting is the occasion when the leaders of the remaining  member states were supposed to give the green light for a special summit in November to finalise the terms of Britains withdrawal.But Mr Coveney made it clear that summit would not go ahead unless signicant progress is made on the border issue.He said: \"Whats more likely is that dates will be suggested, but that there wont be a commitment to a new summit unless there is a signal from the negotiating teams that there is something to sign off on.\"Both sides want to get a deal done here, and I think we need... to allow the negotiating teams to set the pace with a view to making recommendations, hopefully by mid-November, that a new summit is necessary to sign off on a final deal.\"Mr Tusk has warned that without new \"concrete proposals\" from the British to break the logjam over the Irish border backstop, further progress on a deal may be impossible.However, with her party split, and some Tory MPs openly calling for her to go, Mrs May has little room to manoeuvreshe is to secure a deal which stands any chance of getting through Parliament.Ahead of her visit to Brussels, Mrs May was able to secure the backing of her Cabinet, at least for now, amid reports that some Brexiteer ministers were prepared to quitshe gave too much ground to Brussels.However, there was anger among Tory Brexiteers after The Dailyreported that Chancellor Philip Hammond warned the meeting that the UK could still have to pay the EU up to pound billion of the pound billion \"orce bill\" to settle its outstanding liabilities, in the event of a no-deal break.The PM is also due to have bilateral meetings with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker,and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-a-smacking-ban-would-truly-make-us-a-civilised-nation","story":"So why would it be any dferent for a child  When parents chastise their children with a smack or a slap, it is far worse than hitting an adult. Grown-ups can defend themselves, or walk away. A partnership or marriage can end, but childhood lasts forever. Unless parental force is so extreme that the authorities have to step in, young children cannot escape their punishers. They simply have to grow wary, and hope it doesnrsquot happen again.Proposals to outlaw smacking, to be brought before Holyrood in a memberrsquos bill by Green MSP John Finnie, might become law within the year. It will be a historic day, a signal that we are among the most civilised of nations, committed to caring for those who canrsquot protect themselves.When you look at the levels of anger and violence in our own society, let alone the world, this change of culture canrsquot come soon enough. Yet the prospect of the ban has caused protests. Less than a thirdof respondents to a survey support it, and more than halfbelieve smacking should still be allowed.Their main worry, it seems, is not the welfare of children but the potential for so-called respectable adults to be criminalised for raising their offspring as they see fit. For some, as for their own parents and countless generations before them, teaching right from wrong involves tough love. How  can a toddler be prevented from running into the road  Surely a short, sharp lesson will make the point and potentially save their lives Well, perhaps. But to judge by the number of times Irsquove watched little ones yanked by the arm, thumped on the bottom or the back of the legs and even on one occasion slapped hard on the face ndash all without modying their behaviour ndash it would seem the message isnrsquot getting through. Pain and humiliation do not result in obedience and docility. When used too often, or fiercely, smacking causes resentment, rebellion and fear. A woman thwacking her spaniel to bring it to heel would be universally viewed with horror. Some might even dare to remonstrate. But when itrsquos a child, we are schooled to walk on, since itrsquos none of our business.In previous ages, when people were less educated, families large and money tight, physical punishment was deemed perfectly acceptable. Now, however, it looks uncomfortably like brutality. Since time immemorial the British attitude to children has been punitive, telling them to keep quiet, and allowing them to become the butt of unfeeling or sadistic schoolteachers as well as parents. Yet a teacher today who clipped a pupil over the ear or brought a ruler down on the back of their hands would be queuing up at the JobCentre before nightfall. Such acts were outlawed decades ago. By introducing a smacking ban, government will thus be calling time on the harsh treatment inflicted on children at home, where privacy no longer hides them from the reach of the law.Most parents will admit that smacking is not a sign that they are in charge, but that they have lost control. The signal it sends to youngsters is that aggression is a normal response to a situation. To the old argument that ldquoit never did me any harm, take a look at the levels of depression, addiction and anxiety around us. Coming under physical attack from the people who love you most is deeply and sometimes permanently scarring. It can lead to self-harming, to abusive relationships in adulthood and, since they have experienced it from infancy, to lashing out when under duress.Itrsquos half a century since Bob Dylan wrote his prophetic song in which he tells mothers and fathers: ldquoYour sons and your daughters Are beyond your command Your old road is Rapidly aginrsquo. Please get out of the new one If you canrsquot lend your hand  For the times they are a-changinrsquo.They are indeed changing, and for the better. Rethinking how to educate and control children requires time, effort, and bottomless reserves of patience and self-restraint. It involves talking to youngsters, and reasoning with them, once they are old enough to understand, and drawing lines beyond which there will be consequences ndash but none of them violent.I know several young mums with demanding families, one with four boys below eight. She and her husband have acquired the sort of negotiating skills that could win us a brilliant Brexit deal. Explaining, being firm but kind, finding distractions, and never losing it are the new rules. Indeed,countries and international diplomacy were run on the same principles the world, like our children, would be in a better and happier place."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-ministers-set-to-crack-down-on-private-parking-firms","story":"Ministers want to cap penalties at the standard rate charged by councils and introduce a new independent appeals system to deal with disputes.It comes amid widespread concerns that motorists are being ripped off by unscrupulous parking firms ndash and given little option to complain.It is understood the Scottish Government will introduce tighter restrictions as part of its Transport Scotland Bill, due to come before Holyrood early next year.Scottish Tory MSP Murdo Fraser, who has been pushing for a change in the law, said he has agreed to halt his own Private Memberrsquos Bill after officials assured him it would be covered in the upcoming legislation.He said: ldquoCleaning up the rules, creating unorm conditions, maximum penalties and an independent appeals service has the support of the Scottish Government.

And much of it, as my colleague Iain MacWhirter pointed out this week, not well thought out, such as the anti-sectarian bill.The fear of the shirt may also be the fear of the economic cliques the country has encouraged and will continue to grow.Itrsquos a worry, for example, over Creative Scotland, reflected in the hapless judgements of last year, or Scottish Enterprise and a claimed poundm lost in failed businesses in the past decade.But perhaps the fear of the new Adidas jumper reflects a changing national identity.Wersquove kept our dark, cheeky aggression, but lost our sense of community, our support systems, our ldquotake your turn of the stairs mentality.There are deeper thoughts emerging about being part of Team Scotland. Therersquos the worry London mayor Sadiq Khan may be right when he connects nationalism with racism. Therersquos a concern that when hermetic Nationalists valorise Scotland and demand separation from England it implies that England is somehow less. If we care about social justice and egalitarianism why does it need to stop at Carlisle This somehow sits at odds with the times of those early Scotland strips being worn when the essence of being Scottish was summed up by someone such as Jimmy Reid. Perhaps the Scotland jersey was headed for the recycle bank bin when Tommy Sheridan ended up on Big Brother and Alex Salmond on Russia Today.Perhaps the Brigadoon mist cleared with new understandings of what Scotland is about. Itrsquos a knowing of the part we played in the slave trade, that Robert Louis Stevenson created the world view of shortbread tin Scotland, and that in fact he wrote of darker duality of his home nation in the likes of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Kidnapped, that Scotland has long been at war with itself, reflected in aspiration and sometimes sheer greed.Perhaps thatrsquos why I canrsquot see me pulling on that Scotland jersey anytime soon. Althoughwe do qualy for the Euro Championships that the mindset may sht a little."},{"url":null,"title":"david-lindens-scots-accent-proves-too-much-for-his-parliamentary-colleague","story":"The SNPs David Linden, who represents Glasgow East, dutully asked about improvements to disability access during House of Commons Commission questions.But, representing the House authority, former minister Sir Paul Beresford looked puzzled as his brow furrowed.Twice the Surrey MP asked Mr Linden to repeat himself because he could not understand what he had said.Conservative Sir Paul, , who holds dual New Zealand and British citizenship, told him: \"Im sorry, it must be something to do with my antipodean background. Could you please repeat the question because I didnt follow it \"Laughter broke out on the green benches as an \"oh wow\" emanated from the SNP contingent.Mr Linden despondently noted: \"Oh well, Im very popular today.\" He then helpfully repeated the question at a slower pace.But Sir Paul still did not catch on and struggled to understand the refined East End accent and politely asked again for Mr Linden to repeat it once again but this time \"more slowly and in antipodean English\".The Deputy Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, intervened and suggested in his thick Lancastrian twang: ldquoThe answer might be helpedhe can reply in writing.\"Mr Linden gracefully accepted defeat and resorted to sign language across the chamber to confirm to Sir Paul that he would indeed write to his parliamentary colleague.The -year-old politician is not the first Scottish MP to have dficulties making himself understood.Last year, his SNP colleague Alan Brown, who represents Kilmarnock and Loudoun, revealed ministers had so much trouble understanding his fine Ayrshire tones that he rarely received direct answers to his questions when he spoke in the chamber.Reporters at Hansard, the official verbatim report of Parliament, struggle with the same problem and pass notes to the SNP backbencher asking him to write out what he said whenever he rises to speak.Mr Brown explained how the issue has become \"a running joke\" with colleagues and that, whenever he rose to speak, he noticed the minster due to respond sinks back into their green leather bench and put their ear right up against the speaker embedded in it.The parliamentary sketch writers are also known to scratch their heads when the backbencher is speaking.\"Sometimes, said Mr Brown, ldquoHansard ask what other people say but I make the joke that they must have an Ayrshire translator in now but the Ayrshire translator doesnt understand my colleagues.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-ministers-pile-pressure-on-firms-dodging-modern-slavery-duties","story":"Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he will write to every major company in Scotland suspected of flouting rules to prevent human trafficking.Firms with a turnover of more than pound million are legally required to publish an annual statement outlining how they help prevent modern slavery in their supply chains.But research shows a \"signicant minority\" do not appear to have published statements.Ministers have now drawn up guidance aimed at helping bosses identy and prevent exploitation. This includes ensuring workers have access to identication documents and boosting staff training.Speaking at an Anti-Slavery Day conference hosted by the Scottish Government and local government body Cosla, Mr Yousaf said: \"Human trafficking and exploitation prey on the most vulnerable in society.\"Often hidden in plain sight and in legitimate businesses, these offences are on the increase worldwide.\"Since our Trafficking and Exploitation Strategy was published in  we have made signicant progress but businesses need to understand the risks and tackle the conditions that foster these crimes.\"With investors increasingly focusing on human trafficking as a business risk, this is one issue that boards simply cannot afford to ignore.\"He added: \"The guidance launched today offers practical advice for businesses of all sizes and I hope it will help more companies to identy and trafficking and exploitation across their operations, including in their supply chains.\"Our biggest firms must lead by example, ensuring they are not complicit in these horrendous crimes, and that is why I am writing to companies to demand urgent action.\"Mr Yousaf insisted Scottish businesses are \"profiting, whether consciously or unconsciously, from this modern form of slavery\".The new guidance was developed with advice from major firms such as HSBC, the Co-op, Multiplex Construction and energy giant SSE.Alison McGregor, CEO of HSBC Scotland, said: ldquoEvery business plays a critical role in supporting the eradication of human trafficking and helping those that have been affected by it and HSBC is proud to play its part.\"This guidance is an important new tool for all."},{"url":null,"title":"church-of-scotland-reveals-names-of-20-shetland-kirks-earmarked-to-close","story":"It includes churches in a number of islands, as well as in the likes of Tingwall, Gulberwick and Hillswick.The plans have come into force in response to a growing national deficit, a shortage of numbers and reducing congregation numbers.It means that  Church of Scotland buildings will remain open.

Which probably means she did.Having insisted the UK Government had not offered to extend the -month transition period, the PM accepted it was an option to give both sides more time to come up with a trade deal so the guarantee of a backstop would never be needed.But it must be remembered it took the EU and Canada seven years to agree a trade deal.The backlash against the suggested transition extension was inevitable. Tory Brexiteers branded it Brusselsrsquo blackmail, warning it would mean billions more British taxpayersrsquo money flowing into EU coffers as the country effectively remained in the customs union and single market.Time is now running short. Mrs May knows any deal has to get Westminster approval by the time the Commons rises on December . No  reassuringly said there were no plans to cancel Christmas.

At his press conference, the French President declared: ldquoIts now very clearly up to the British Prime Minister and her staff to come back with a solution based on the necessary political compromise on the UK side.\"He stressed Brexit was no longer a technical issue and the ball was in the UK court. ldquoItrsquos not for the EU to make concessions to deal with UK political issues. I couldnrsquot be clearer on this, said the President.For her part, the PM admitted there would be ldquomore dficult moments ahead but a deal was still possible.ldquoThese were always going to be tough negotiations and they were always going to get tougher as we got to the closing stages.She highlighted the upbeat remarks of Mrs Merkel and Mr Juncker and insisted there was a ldquovery real sense people want that deal to be done.After Mr Tusk again made clear the EU was willing to offer an extension to the transition period to create extra space for a trade deal to be agreed and Mr Juncker said it ldquoprobably will happen, the PM stressed this was not something the UK was proposing and, indeed, it was not something she felt was necessary.But, nonetheless, she admitted extending the transition by a ldquomatter of months could be a solution to the backstop issue ie maintaining the status quo for longer.However, the notion riled Tory Brexiteers.Sir Bill Cash, the veteran Eurosceptic, said it was unthinkable that Britain ldquoshould be blackmailed by the EU into paying billions more pounds into EU coffers with an extended transition.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tories, said the proposed extension was \"a poorly thought-through idea,\" which could lead to ldquovery substantial costs for the UK as there might be a move to get it to contribute to the next long-term EU budget.Nigel Dodds, the Democratic Unionistsrsquo deputy leader, was also dismissive, saying an extension would ldquocost the United Kingdom billions of pounds yet our fundamental problem with the EU proposal remains\".Gerard Batten, the Ukip leader, said an extension was a play to normalise transition, claiming: \"Mrs Mays Brexit betrayal slowly slithers into view.Leave-backing Cabinet Ministers Michael Gove and Penny Mordaunt also expressed the need to crack on with the Brexit process.The Environment Secretary said it was \"vital\" the UK left EU at the \"earliest possible point\" while the International Development Secretary noted: \"The PM was very clear this morning in statements she has given that she recognises the need to do things swtly, not least because that is what public expects.\"Underscoring Tory ldquodespair, former minister Nick Boles, a Remainer, claimed both sides in the talks were ldquorunning down the clock to argue a no-deal was inevitable. \"Im afraid the PM is losing the confidence now of colleagues of all shades of opinion, he said.British business expressed its frustration that the ldquomoment of truth in sealing a deal had not arrived in Brussels and the process was dragging itself out.The CBI warned the business communityrsquos patience was \"nearing an end.Its Director General, Carolyn Fairburn, said: ldquoWith each week that passes, firms are accelerating their contingency planning, erting investment and costing jobs. If extending transition period makes withdrawal agreement easier to agree, it should be welcomed.\"Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn said: ldquoMore than two years after the referendum, the Tories still have no credible plan to deliver Brexit. They have spent far more time arguing with themselves than negotiating with the EU.The Labour leader added: ldquoTheresa May must now act in the national interest, not her party interest, and break the deadlock by delivering a deal that protects jobs and living standards."},{"url":null,"title":"bennachie saved from a96 dual plans","story":"The option to create a dual carriageway through the Bennachie area has been scrapped by the Scottish Government.It has been removed following initial design and assessment work, and also feedback from the public.Initial options removed include the existing A Inverurie Bypass and the offline southern route between east of Huntly and Blackburn, which passes through the Bennachie Special Landscape Area.Local communities and road users in the Inverurie area have the chance to see and comment on the options being taken forward for further design as the Scottish government looks to identy a preferred route option next year.Public exhibitions will be held at Inverurie Town Hall todayand tomorrow , and residents in Huntly will get to have their say on Wednesdayat Stewarts Hall.

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting. Unfortunately, Highland Council appears not to have.\"As a result, I have written to them to ask them to give further consideration to this approach, especially when the committee has heard how well this works in other areas.\"She added: \"While the Highland Council representative did note that there was engagement with the third sector, communities and citizen  for budgeting in the past, I am concerned that engagement, dialogue and meaningful consultation did not happen in the run-up to the budget process for this financial year.\"Im concerned that we are now close to the budget being presented to council and meaningful engagement has still not taken place.\"Highland Council plans to close  of its  public toilets to save pound, a year but opponents claim the move could lead to a visitor boycott.Campaigners delivered a ,-signature petition to Highland Council last month and claimed the proposal has already impacted the tourism sector. They say the closure of the toilets would have an environmental and economic impact. A coach tour firm cancelled a booking over concern for its customers needing comfort breaks.As previously reported, local businessman Andrew Mackay said the threat of toilet closures in Caithness could create \"a negative impression\" of the area and impact on the number of people visiting.Mr Mackay, who has hotels in Wick, Thurso and Castletown and is a board member of the tourism body Venture North, said: \"The perception that there is a shortage of toilets in Caithness ndash and where in the Highlands ndash could impact adversely on the area.\"Any negative publicity could have an effect on the industry. We have a short season and need to capitalise on all markets.\"Green MSP John Finnie recently accused the council of pressing ahead with the closure of toilets in the face of its own evidence that it could have an impact on public health. An equality impact assessment conducted into the proposals identied issues for older people, those with disabilities and pregnant women.Mr Finnie said: \"Despite this, the council leadership are determined to press ahead in their usual incoherent manner, ignoring procedures, policies and good practice.\"Given the clear implications for public health, and potential for increased instances of public nuisance, it is astonishing that the council has not discussed this matter with NHS Highland and Police Scotland.\"Friday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118016.jpg","title":"Marathon trek pays off for charity","story":"A THURSO man has raised more than pound for charity by walking coast-to-coast across Scotland.Douglas Fraser decided to raise awareness of prostate cancer and raise money at the same time.\"As I enjoy walking I decided to do a coast-to-coast walk across Scotland and ask the public to donate money.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority.

The new strategy will shape the country’s transport priorities for the next  years.Age Scotland and Transport Scotland have said they have been working closely with older people in communities across island, rural and urban Scotland since spring to understand how transport affects older peoples’ daily lives.Gillian Skuse, Charity Director of Age Scotland Orkney, stressed how important it is that local older people get involved in these discussions.“We’ve heard from older people around the islands that transport can impact their mobility, running their errands, enjoying activities and being part of their local communities. This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed. Tea and coffee will be available on arrival from . am with the day starting at . am.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much.

Cllr Alex Stanorth said: “There’s a very signicant reduction in the number of trees on the site. “Citywide, we are seeing our stocks dwindle. There are fewer trees in the city than there were five years ago and we should look to reverse that.”And now as work to cut down the trees has started, members of the public have reacted to the sight of the shorn tree stumps, lining the pathway from the gallery back to the Scott Monument.Sharon Robertson was enraged at the “sheer destruction” she encountered when \u2028walking through the gardens on Wednesday.“I was shocked – year on year more and more trees are cut down at Shandwick Place for the trams, at London Road round-a-bout there used to be beautul cherry blossom trees, all the trees that had been planted on Leith Walk cut down for the trams, MacDonald Road all trees cut down and now Meadowbank proposed felling. It’s outrageous.” Council landscapers said research into the historic design demonstrated the area warranted “larger oaks and limes” more appropriate to the landscape.They said they were “quite comfortable” with the numbers and types of trees the developers would be putting back into the gardens.Landscape architect Julie Waldron added: “If we were to put them all back the views, not now but in the future, might again become quite enclosed. We’re trying to open them up.” The National Galleries isworking with the council to remove the trees. A spokesman sad: “This will enable us to create a new, sloped path that will make the gardens and gallery fully accessible to people with mobility impairments, prams and pushchairs. The reduction of the currently dense tree canopy will also recreate carefully framed views through the gardens to the Old Town. These views were part of the architect William Henry Playfair’s original vision for this world-famous location. “The work will also involve the replanting of  large saplings and semi-mature trees, with species chosen to tie in well with existing trees in the wider gardens”.fiona.pringle@jpress©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4817047.1539929794!/image/image.jpg","title":"gleneagles golf resort owners to open luxury hotel in edinburgh","story":"A slice of historic Gleneagles will be landing in the Capital as plans for a high-end hotel are set to be approved by councillors.Ennismore, owner of the famous Perthshire estate and golf resort, will take over two empty premises at St Andrew Square with the -bedroom Gleneagles Hotel. A bronze rear extension called the garden pavilion will be constructed as well as a new rooftop terrace for members, subject to approval from the City of Edinburgh Council.The former Bank of Scotland premises next to Dundas House, which closed its doors in , will be transformed into Gleneagles’ new venture. The company is also pushing forward plans for a new sister hotel in the Mayfair area of London. The projects are the first expansion in the brand’s -year history - labelled a “landmark moment for the business”.Ennismore’s vision for the Edinburgh project will provide a mix of seasonal Scottish dining, luxury hotel rooms, private meeting and event spaces along with bars that “celebrate the best of Scotland’s whisky”.Developers hope the two sister hotels in Edinburgh and London will “allow Gleneagles to look after its already loyal guests more frequently” as well as introduce “new global audiences” to the iconic Scottish brand.A spokesman from Ennismore said: “We have worked hard with the council and partners to ensure that one of the city’s finest listed buildings is preserved and restored sensitively to create a fantastic new hotel and dining experience.“We believe this will further enhance Edinburgh’s range of high quality hospitality and leisure offering line with the aspirations of both the council and Marketing Edinburgh.”The developers have also applied for permission to build a full-width, recessed roof extension with an external terrace on the front section of the building – which will sit behind the building’s prominent statues.To the rear of the two properties, a modern single storey and basement structure will be built, containing bedrooms, dining and kitchen spaces. The extension will be finished in bronze cladding  with metal-framed windows.Both buildings at St Andrew Square date back to the late th century. When the larger building was completed, it was the most prominent building on the east side of St Andrew Square until the mid th century.The vision has been welcomed by council leader Cllr Adam McVey, who said the plans demonstrated Edinburgh’s attraction as a destination.He said: “Gleneagles is a fantastic Scottish business and by expanding into Edinburgh they’re giving a strong vote of confidence to the hospitality market in the Capital.“Having visited the development, the proposals being put forward are a strong addition to the city’s offering and bring a vibrant use back to another building on St Andrew Square which is the focus of a number of exciting ongoing developments.“While we won’t know the final decision of the planning application until the planning committee considers the application in full on Wednesday, it’s encouraging to see Edinburgh continuing to attract investments on this scale.”Gleneagles is following the likes of The Ivy and Dishoom in choosing St Andrew Square as a high-end destination in the Capital – while the Edinburgh Grand luxury apartments are available next to the new hotel. Proposals have also been lodged with planners for a concert hall, the Impact Centre, to the rear of Dundas House. The eastern end of the city centre is undergoing an overhaul – with construction of the new St James Centre also well underway.The arrival of the Gleneagles Hotel will be another welcome boost to Edinburgh’s hospitality and tourism industries.John Donnelly, chief executive at Marketing Edinburgh, said: “The Gleneagles name is known globally for its first-class hospitality, so the addition of the club hotel at St Andrew Square would be yet another premium asset for Edinburgh.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801939.1539761591!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment scotland s beauty must be preserved amid green energy boom","story":"Scotland is well placed to profit from wind energy but must ensure the beauty of its landscape is preserved.As Scottish Conservative energy spokesman Alexander Burnett pointed out yesterday, some people view windfarms as an “unsightly” blot on the landscape. And they, he added, are “simply unwilling to have more turbines foisted upon them”.So they will doubtless be dismayed by the news that Scottish Power has sold off its gas and hydro plants to concentrate on wind and renewables, with plans to more than double the capacity of windfarms currently generating electricity or under construction. However, for others, it is a sign of things to come, a move that heralds a new age as the world moves towards a zero-carbon future that will enable us to avoid dangerous climate change and bring a literal breath of fresh air to blow away potentially deadly pollution.These two groups may seem implacably opposed to one another, but in reality they both make valid points. Scotland is famous all over the world for the romantic beauty of its landscape, a fact that helps encourage millions of tourists to come here. Allowing the industrialisation of the Highlands would be a scandal. But, fortunately, that does not need to happen. Scotland has vast amounts of wind energy and it is possible to site onshore windfarms in places where they do not desecrate the countryside. : Scottish Power becomes first big UK energy firm to switch to % wind powerAnd the most consistent supply of wind is found out to sea, particularly on the west coast, as anyone who has visited the Outer Hebrides can attest. The UK Government has been criticised for failing to encourage onshore windfarms – not least because they are a source of increasingly cheap electricity. However, part of Westminster’s strategy has been to encourage offshore wind in the hope that the UK – and particularly Scotland – can create a globally signicant industry. As UK Energy Minister Claire Perry pointed out in The Scotsman yesterday, the transition to renewable energy is a challenge but also “one of the greatest industrial opportunities of our time”. So Scotland can help the world fight climate change and make money in the process.And it is the latter reason that is perhaps the most important driving force, as Scottish Power’s chief executive Keith Anderson suggested when he said: “We are leaving carbon generation behind for a renewable future powered by cheaper green energy.” The firm has become the first of the ‘Big Six’ to ditch fossil fuels but simple economics means it is unlikely to be the last,: UK Energy Minister: Scotland has a chance of a letime on green energy©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism.

I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues.

I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box.

Islands proofing – ensuring the islands are recognised in any law or government regulation – must work.#There are too many cases right now where that is not happening, such as the government imposing car parking charges on leline airports where there is no public transport alternative.#For the Islands Act to be worth the parchment it’s written on, these things must change.#Islands Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: #The Scottish Islands have contributed and continue to contribute hugely to our culture and heritage and, with this Act now starting to take force, will now have the opportunity to contribute even further to their own and our collective futures.#They have very distinctive needs so the Act introduces a number of measures to ensure there is a sustained focus across government and the wider public sector to meet the needs of island communities now and in the future.“On a more visual front, it ensures Shetland will no longer be ‘boxed off’ on maps which has been a cause of irritation to those living in Shetland.#When producing a map of Scotland, the Shetland Islands must therefore be displayed in a way that accurately and proportionately represents their geographical location in relation to the rest of Scotland.“It introduces a new duty on Scottish ministers and the wider public sector to have regard to island communities when exercising their s and preparing policy, strategies, services and legislation – known as “island-proofing”.“And the National Islands Plan will also be produced which, amongst other things, gives us a strategic direction to improve outcomes for our islands by creating the right environment for investment, empowerment and increasing sustainable economic growth.” raquoI#m glad to hear that Shetlandcan#t be put into a box on maps.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands of tonnes of salt arrives for winter roads ","story":" into waiting trucks on the quayside at Scalloway.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Friday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/ResizeCache/00125000/00125302 - 124x067.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"A quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the Abut that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  years by at CNPArsquos October planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.

At Glenmore the project will provide a new and enhanced path, and associated parking arrangements, to link the visitor attractions and accommodation.\"This will make it easier, safer and more attractive for visitors to walk and cycle in the key visitor hot spot within the Cairngorms National Park.\"Friday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117830.jpg","title":"Wildlife park savours more roaring success","story":"Gavin MusgroveA BADENOCH attraction has had a year to remember after being voted the best family day out in Scotland and seeing visitor numbers soar by a staggering  per cent.. by Kincraig claimed the top honour at the Scottish Outdoor Leisure Awards on Friday evening.Voted for by the public, the awards recognise leading outdoor and leisure attractions which give their customers amazing experiences and help strengthen Scotlands reputation as one of the worlds top travel destinations.The park was announced as the winner at a ceremony at the Glasgow Marriott Hotel.Daska Mackintosh, the parks head of operations and visitors services, said: \"We are thrilled to have been voted the best family day out in Scotland.\"It is a lovely way to celebrate the incredibly busy year we have had so far, with a record number of visitors already.\"In December we were delighted to welcome the birth of Hamish, the UKs only polar bear cub, which has led to a dramatic rise in people coming to the park. at the park this year, including Scottish wildcat kittens, adding to the fascinating conservation story we have to tell.\"We pride ourselves in offering a very enjoyable experience and it is wonderful to see our teams hard work being recognised with such a prestigious national award.\"With the parks polar bear cub Hamish approaching his first birthday his playful nature and confidence is continuing to delight visitors of all ages.Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the attraction, said: \"The Hamish effect has resulted in RZSS Highland Wildle Park smashing all of our previous attendance records with over , visitors so far.\"This represents a  per cent increase for the same period last year and is already , over our previous all-time record for an entire year.\"It is argued that weather can signicantly impact attendance levels.

It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry. That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems. We have kids being stranded on buses for hours and cues over  cars deep in both directions. To be fair the council at least seem willing to listen. We now need to get all parties round the table and hammer out a plan on this as quickly as possible, the current situation cannot continue.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"raasay shop offers delivery service amid stormy","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA local store on Raasay is offering to deliver essentials to those who can#t access the shop due to weather conditions on the island.Following the . am crossing to Sconser on Friday morning , CalMac announced that it had suspended all sailings between Raasay and Skye due to the conditions.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way.

What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8672036.1539773501!/image/image.jpg","title":"over 100 jobs being created at mcdonald s","story":"McDonald#s will be creating over  new jobs with the opening of a new dual lane drive through estaurant at The Junction Retail and Leisure Park in Antrim.The restaurant which will be operated by new franchisee Paddy Cusack is set to open on November  and will operate  .

Speaking to the , Councillor Gaston said: “I was contacted by local residents bout the footpath, and as the time has gone on, the problem has just got worse. “I got in contact with the Roads Department and they have been carrying out work to find the source of the problem.“The issue has now been flagged to the structural department from the maintenance department, and tests were carried out on the footpath and road just last week.” The heart of the problem lies with a tree that is growing through a wall at the edge of the footpath. However, there is also some natural subsidence that also needs to be addressed.Councillor Gaston wishes to give some reassurance to the public about the current safety of the footpath and boundary wall.He said: “The Department have said the wall is in no immediate danger of collapsing, but obviously there is a danger of this in the future, so I am eagerly and actively pushing that a solution be reached, before the problem gets any worse.” Many residents have expressed a fear thatthe situation persists, the road may have to be closed indefinitely, which is something Councillor Gaston is also keen to avoid. “There is a fear that part of the road might actually come away, so I am urging officials to act quickly to get a plan in place and be proactive about a solution so as work can be carried out in a controlled way, and the road will only have to be closed for necessary work, not indefinitely.”No plan for the road has been made to date, however officials are currently assessing the wall, footpath and road, and work on devising a plan is underway.

Frank’s story is one of a number which has been put together for the release of a tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends of Thomas and Gerard which is to be launched this weekend in Sailortown.Frank, who is now -years-old worked for Casey’s for over twenty years, recalls that day when fate determined who was in the yard that morning when the gunmen arrived.“My main job in Casey’s was to drive the old Bedford TK lorry, making deliveries to pubs, clubs and off licences. I always had one of the young lads on board as a helper,” explained Frank.“Every Wednesday for thirteen years I delivered to Casey’s off licences in Derry and Coleraine. They would ring in their orders on Monday. We would load up the old reliable Bedford on Tuesday and drive up to them on Wednesday morning.“On the day of the shooting that routine was changed which was fortunate for me and whoever was to go with me in the lorry that day. “The off licence in Derry, was due to be sold that Wednesday. If the sale went through, it meant that we would not be delivering to Derry, only Coleraine.It wasn’t until mid-afternoon that word came through that the sale went ahead. Frances Donnelly asked meI wanted to go on up to Coleraine that afternoon. As it was getting a bit late, I knew that we would not get back to the yard until after seven, so I told her that Thursday would be better. Frances gave me a choice that day and the choice that I made, saved my le.“On the Thursday morning we done a bit of tidying up around the yard and got ready to leave with the drink order.I didn’t know who was coming with me, it could have been any of the three lads, Thomas, another lad called Paul McDonald, and of course Gerard .“The owner, Sam Casey needed some pallets fixed, so that meant that Thomas was not going to go with me, because he was the best man for repairing pallets. That left two of lads to pick from, Paul and Gerard.“For some reason none of them wanted to go out that day and to settle matters Paul tossed a coin to see who had first choice, Gerard won the toss and he chose to stay in the yard. “It wasn’t really a big deal for Paul, he went into the store, got his jacket and that was us, we got into the lorry and left the yard, heading for Coleraine.”Frank and Paul headed off for Coleraine but little did they know what was to happen back in Belfast.“We found out later that we had only left the yard shortly before the gunmen arrived. For me, it was just another normal day. We were oblivious to the fact that while we were happily cruising along the motorway that gunmen had slaughtered our work colleagues and friends, back in Casey’s.“About an hour and a half after leaving Belfast I went into the off licence to speak to the manager. I took a phone call – ‘Frank, they are all dead’. I didn’t catch on what he meant, but it soon became clear and he asked who was with me. I told him that Paul was with me. “That confirmed to Vincent  that it was Thomas and Gerard who had been shot. Vincent was married to Marie, one of Sam Casey’s daughters, who worked in the upstairs office along with her sister Frances. Vincent happened to go in to the yard, unaware of what had happened, he saw one of his workers lying dead and when he went upstairs to the office he was met with an absolute blood bath. His we and her sister had been brutally murdered. “I drove back to Belfast in the lorry along with Paul, but I have absolutely no memory of the journey or the conversation between us, but I do remember going to the yard and getting the gates opened so I could drive the lorry in. “When I got into the yard there was blood everywhere, even on the fork lt. There was no one about, but I had no sooner got the lorry parked up, when newspaper reporters started to arrive outside, looking for interviews.“Thomas was seriously wounded and after treatment in hospital, was released after about two weeks. I know that Sam Casey was elated at the fact that Thomas had survived and was on the mend. Sam’s elation soon turned to deep sadness, Thomas died from his wounds exactly three weeks after he was shot.“The gunmen who went into the yard that day and shot my friends down like dogs have to bear the absolute responsibility, but fate played a role, as to who was in the yard when the murderers arrived.“The destiny of at least nine people was decided that day. The survival of the workers who would normally have been in the yard every single Thursday and the slaughter of those who happened to be there, was a matter of “s and buts” and for Gerard it was the outcome of a simple toss of a coin. “Yes, the outcome of the toss of a coin sealed Gerard’s fate, but saved the le of another worker. For Thomas, it was his skills at repairing wooden pallets that meant that he was working in the yard that morning.“I also think of the salesman who had been in the yard on business that morning and left just as we were driving out the gate. “Sam Casey, whose two daughters were murdered, would also have been in the yard that morning had he not have been in the Mater Hospital where he was recovering from a minor operation.”The tribute book will be launched this Sundayin the Mission to Seafarers Centre in Sailortown, soon after a plaque unveiling at pm at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"two hundred jobs created at springfield factory in two years","story":"THE Innovation Factory in West Belfast is celebrating the creation of more than  jobs on its second anniversary.The business hub on the Springfield Road opened in October  with the aim of encouraging entrepren-eurship, innovation, and helping new high-tech businesses to grow.The  businesses located at Innovation Factory are some of the most ground-breaking, innovative companies in the north dealing in areas such as G technology, software development, film production and digital applications.Majella Barkley, Innovation Director, said: “The key to the success of Innovation Factory has been flexibility and support modern businesses need to be able to change and adapt their environment rapidly.

Judges unanimously agreed the bakery had objected to the message and not the messenger. Last night, Ashers said the company is trading well, and the decision not to renew the lease on the Royal Avenue branch of the bakery chain was based purely on specic commercial considerations relating to that outlet.General manager Daniel McArthur said: \"It simply comes down to the figures. \"We decided not to renew the lease. \"Belfast city centre isnt busy enough - our other shops are much busier.\" Mr McArthur added: \"Its been planned for some time, and I am pleased to say there will be no job losses.\"The Royal Avenue outlet is one of nine retail sites operated by the company in the east Antrim and Belfast area.News of the Ashers closure comes as city centre traders say the once-vibrant shopping heart of the city has become a ghost town in the wake of the devastating Bank Buildings blaze.A security cordon ensures pedestrians and shoppers are kept away from the gutted former Primark store - but it also prevents them reaching the many shops close to the charred Castle Junction ruin.Some businesses have called for the building to be pulled down immediately to mitigate the economic impact.However, it is understood any demolition project would be signicantly complicated by safety concerns around the huge structure.Heritage campaigners have called for the listed building to be saved.Primark itself has contributed half a million pounds to help traders affected by the blaze and the subsequent security ring of steel.

A year now has been lost already, but the longer this goes on the further the date for potential graduates is being pushed back.\"SDLP health spokesman Mark H Durkan said the stalling of the medical school in Derry is an example of how people are paying the price for a lack of government.The Foyle MLA said: \"I am hopeful that the Gardiner report will tell us what people working in healthcare here have been telling us for years - that this medical school in Derry is an urgent necessity to train more doctors and to attract and retain doctors in the west.\"However, what is clear is that, regardless of what the reports findings and recommendations are, this vital project will not progress in the absence of ministerial approval and, given the continued absence of ministers, that means it wont progress.\"The clock is ticking, the lack of government here is costing people dearly and costing people daily and this is yet another example of how.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dup would strongly oppose a housing development at down royal says poots","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Now we know how complex and time-consuming the Brexit battle has become. Now we know how potentially dangerous Brexit is proving for community relations on this island, for trade, indeed, for the very constitutional future of Northern Ireland..pushHad we all known on June , , referendum day, what we know now, its quite likely many people might have opted to vote dferently, or not at all, or, perhaps, the electoral turnout might have been much higher.Too late now. The milk is spilt and we can cry over it as much as we want as we watch the failure of the UK and the EC leaders to come to terms yet again with the minefield of Anglo-Irish politics and to find a solution to the border issue.The referendum result declared  months ago has left British politics in a mess, a Government teetering on the brink of collapse and exit from the European community now on an even longer finger than before.At the heart of the Brexit battle lies the DUP, without whose support the Conservative Government of the UK will fall.There are two contrasting judgments on the DUPs Brexit performance to date.History may show that the party saved the Union by thwarting all efforts to detach Northern Ireland from Great Britain with a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea.Or, conversely, history might show that the DUP placed that Union in jeopardy by slavishly supporting Brexit in the first place in the face of majority opinion in Northern Ireland which wished Europe and the UK to stay together as before.Which of these points of view you might agree with is likely to depend on whether you wish to leave the European community, or to remain.For the moment, the DUP can paint itself as protector and potential saviour of the Union. But not until the ink is dried on any final deal can anyone know for certainthis will be the case.If the issue of the Irish border couldnt be resolved after two years of trying, the question must be whether buying more time will make any dference.The obvious danger for the DUP is the risk that, as more time passes, a frustrated British public and political opinion will sicken of the border issue and see it as hindering progress on so much  of Brexit business.Granted, Theresa May speaks passionately on the constitutional ties binding the UK, but can the same be said of others around her, one of whom could well be her successor in Downing Street And what of Jeremy Corbyn,he were to lead the next British Government  How unsympathetic is he likely to be towards those Northern Ireland unionists who have raged against him over the years about his republican links and fought tooth and nail at Westminster to preserve the Tories wafer-thin majority and keep his Labour Party at bay Were it not for the DUPs current control over the Governments destiny, would Nigel Dodds and Sammy Wilson and the partys other eight MPs command anything like the same attention and interest in the tea-rooms of Westminster that they enjoy now  And whatthey didnt What, then, for the future of Northern Ireland, the border issue, links with Europe and the world  What price then the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a border between north and south, or a border down the Irish Sea The worst-case scenario for the DUP and unionism in general must be any sign that public and political opinion in Britain is turning off the border problem. The longer it appears unresolvable, the more likely the current mood across the water will change to one of mounting frustration that,it were not for Ireland, north and south, a deal could be agreed.Already, backbench Conservatives are annoyed by threats against the Government by the DUP. More than  million people who voted to remain in the EU are not enthused with the DUPs tough Brexit stance.Others argue that, while the DUP insists on being treated as an equal and integral part of the UK, it does not uphold the rest of the nations standards on fundamental moral issues, such as abortion and gay rights, nor does it represent majority opinion in Northern Ireland on the Brexit issue.These are testing times for the link with Britain and require all the diplomatic skills of locally elected politicians to ensure people in England, in particular, do not turn sourly towards us and ask, as some are already doing,the price of a borderless Irish border is really worth sacricing a swt and clean break from the EU.Avoiding a hard border is not rocket science. It requires tarf-less trade and minimal regulatory oversight of goods and services. Until we know whether the UK can achieve a free trade deal with Brussels, the border issue cannot be properly resolved and that looks a long way off after this weeks deadlock.The Irish joined the Common Market in  at the same time as the UK. Trade between the two countries was then - and remains to this day - joined at the hip. Yes, southern trade with Europe is on a much wider footing today, but the stretch of water between Britain and the Republic still accounts for £bn annually.That is surely reason enough for Leo Varadkar to stay as close to Theresa May as he has done to Michael Barnier and Donald Tusk. He may believe his bread is buttered in Brussels, but the reality is, whether nationalists north or south care to recognise it, their bread is also buttered in Britain.A case can be made for special EU status - not just for Northern Ireland, but for the whole of this island. Nationalist Ireland, north and south, may bury its head in anti-British sentiment, but it cannot escape, any more than unionists can do, the economic realities of today and the need for the Brexit negotiations to reach a deal which will not unduly damage any part of this island.The DUP, in its haste to fly Northern Ireland out of Europe as swtly as possible, now finds the Brexit Airbus crash-landed on shting political sands.The ided politics of Northern Ireland, largely forgotten about by the outside world since the Good Friday Agreement, are back on the international stage.The border is examined and walked over by politicians from Brussels, London and Dublin, its undulating greenery and winding byways the focus of global media attention.Meanwhile, people here watch and wait and wonder where it will all end. The sense of uncertainty is palpable everywhere.So much of our futures now hang worryingly on the decisions of people who know so little about us, in the far-flung member states of the EU. So much rests with Westminster and Brussels.What we do know is that, of the  million who supported Brexit in that referendum, the future of Northern Ireland was not on the agenda as it is now. The people of Britain who voted for and against went to the polling booths without a thought for our constitutional future, the Belfast Agreement, or the Irish border.At the time, they seemed more interested in Boris Johnsons battle bus, with its erroneous promise of £m a week for the NHS in the event of Brexit, than any danger that their vote might lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.The most recent opinion poll, conducted by LucidTalk, reflects a deep distrust among voters in Northern Ireland for the Conservative Government - despite Theresa Mays solemn assurances on Northern Irelands place in the UK.One in three DUP voters say they do not trust Mrs May to keep her promise of no border down the Irish Sea.And % of voters in general express distrust, % have doubts and only % think Mrs May will stick to her word.Such concern is founded on past experience - most recently, the manner in which Margaret Thatcher signed the  Anglo-Irish Agreement over the heads of unionists.Nor is it forgotten that another Tory leader, Edward Heath, in , suspended Stormont and effectively ended  years of unionist majority rule.Now, the question that lingers in the body politic of unionism is: could it happen again What price the level of political expediency required to find a deal with Brussels  At what price for Northern Ireland Even the DUP is now confessing deepening concern. Arlene Foster warns Theresa May that she must not do a Margaret Thatcher on Northern Ireland. Nigel Dodds says: \"We need to get real. The UK cannot be broken up. This is clearly a battle for the Union itself.\"Had any such fears been recognised, or admitted, on the eve of the referendum in June , might not some who voted for Brexit have had second thoughts about doing so Its too late now, but undoubtedly worry abounds among many here about the eventual terms of any deal."},{"url":null,"title":"karen bradley accused of passing buck with introduction of new laws","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

whose votes are crucial to the survival of Mrs Mays Government - has described as a \"deal-breaker\" any move to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK as part of a Brexit settlement with the EU.Current EU plans call for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and single markettalks during the transition period fail to reach agreement.Irish Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee also claimed yesterday that the Prime Minister had already promised Dublin that there would not be a time limit on the \"Irish backstop\" proposals, which could see Northern Ireland treated dferently from the rest of the UK in the aftermath of Brexit.Mr Dodds added: \"The DUP wants a Brexit deal that works for our nearest neighbours in the European Union but which respects the constitutional and economic integrity of the precious Union.\"The backstop as proposed by the EU would undermine the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom.\"Im glad that it is not just unionists in Northern Ireland who recognise the dangers of the EU proposals on the backstop to the Union.\"Such a backstop is unacceptable to many others from right across the United Kingdom.\"Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann also hit out at the backstop plans, saying that the EU should go \"back to the drawing board\".He added: \"Theresa May has asked the EU for flexibility and they should give her that.\"It is in everyones interests to get a sensible deal that respects the result of the referendum, that doesnt undermine the Belfast Agreement and maintains a frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland.\"However, I continue to be disappointed by the intransigent language of Leo Varadkar and the Irish Government.\"\"If they continue to hold to the position that its either a border in the Irish Sea or no deal, it is likely to have dire consequences on both sides of the border in terms of both economies and relationships across these islands.\"The two-day European Council summit which ended yesterday had long been pencilled in as a \"moment of truth\" when agreement must be reached to provide time for ratication and avoid the UK leaving without a deal on March , .But no deal was struck and the leaders of the  remaining EU states decided not to call a special Brexit summit in November after chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he needed \"much more time\" for talks.There was no mention of Brexit in the five pages of conclusions released at the end of the two-day gathering.At the end of the summit, Mrs May said good progress was being made on the UKs withdrawal agreement, but acknowledged that \"a few, but considerable, outstanding issues\" remained to be resolved.\"There is a lot of hard work ahead, there will be more dficult moments as we enter the final stages of the talks, but Im convinced we will secure a good deal that is in the interests of the UK and of the European Union,\" she said.Mrs May declined to put any fixed date on the possible extension to the UKs transition period, which she has said could last \"a matter of months\" into .UK officials stressed that the move was not being proposed by the UK but the Prime Minister was ready to consider it.It is thought the extra time may give negotiators leeway to resolve the question of how to construct a backstop which would keep the Irish border open in the absence of a broader trade deal.Unsurprisingly, Brexiteers reacted with fury to the idea of the transition - during which the UK would remain in the single market and customs union and subject to EU rules - being extended beyond the end of December  at a potential cost of billions of pounds in contributions to EU budgets.European Research Group chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg said it would mean \"we are in the EU for longer when the EU can make rules for the UK over which we would have no say - and we would be paying for the privilege\"."},{"url":null,"title":"northern irelands remain parties slam pm over meeting snub","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

selected, soyou’re planning on chancing your arm any time soon, perhaps this will make for useful reading.Subject: Medicine Biomedical SciencesInterviewer: Chris Norbury, The Queen’s CollegeQuestion: The viruses that infect us are totally dependent on human cells for their reproduction is it therefore surprising that viruses cause human diseases  “In a tutorial-style discussion, strong candidates will engage with the paradox that viruses need us for their own reproduction, and yet cause us damage,” said Chris on the university website.So discussing zombies… isn’t off the table Subject: MusicInterviewer: Laura Tunbridge, St Catherine’s CollegeQuestion: What are the dferent ways in which you listen to music  How does that change the way in which you think about what you’re listening to  “The question allows students to use their own musical experiences as a starting point for a broader and more abstract discussion about the dferent ways people consume music, the relationship between music and technology, and how music can define us socially,” said Laura.Subject: ChemistryInterviewer: Martin Galpin, University CollegeQuestion: How many dferent molecules can be made from six carbon atoms and  hydrogen atoms   “This question gives candidates an opportunity to demonstrate a wide understanding of chemistry and there is no simple, immediate answer,” said Martin.That probably means saying a random number and leaving it there isn’t enough…Subject: Theology and ReligionInterviewer: Peter Groves, Worcester CollegeQuestion: Is religion of value whether or not there is a God  “This is a question we would hope any candidate for Theology and Religion would enjoy answering,” said Peter. “It raises a number of issues for them to explore. “What is our definition of religion, and how fluid is that definition  What do we mean by value, and how might it be measured  Are the effects of religion in the past as important as its consequences in the present ”Subject: Earth SciencesInterviewer: Conall MacNiocaill, Exeter CollegeQuestion: How can we estimate the mass of the atmosphere  “This question can be addressed in iety of ways and addresses several of our selection criteria,” said Conall. “An aptitude for analysing and solving a problem using a logical and critical approach lateral thinking and hypothesis generation the ability to manipulate quantities and units and the ability to apply familiar conceptsto unfamiliar situations.”Hint: industrial scales are not the correct answer in this situation.Subject: Earth SciencesInterviewer: Roger Benson, St Edmund HallQuestion: Tell me what this rock looks like. “This question does not rely on pre-existing knowledge of geology or rocks,” said Roger. “In fact, what we are interested in is whether the candidates can make accurate and critical observationsand are able to interpret the meaning of those observations using their knowledge of physical and chemical processes .”Subject: HistoryInterviewer: Sian Pooley, Magdalen CollegeQuestion: What can historians not find out about the past  “The aim of this question is to encourage candidates to think critically, creatively and comparatively about how historians know what happened in the past,” said Sian. “I would use this sort of open question to allow a candidate to talk about the availability of historical evidence in

But, more importantly, itrsquos good news for our holidaymakers and bathers who can confidently enjoy our fabulous beaches.ldquoWe take great pride in these results and know that maintaining them will take a sustained effort. We will continue to work to reduce water pollution to keep our bathing waters clean and safe.Mr Small added: ldquoOur beaches are a priceless resource to tourism and to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike. It is imperative that we continue to strive for the very highest of standards.NI Water has also welcomed confirmation that all  beaches tested have met European standards for bathing water quality.Angela Halpenny, head of environmental regulation, said protecting the environment was an important part of NI Waterrsquos business.She said NI Water was delighted to hear that all  designated bathing waters have met European standards but warned against complacency, highlighting the need to push forward with further investment to ensure continued improvements are made.The beach water quality results were announced by the Better Beaches Forum whose members include DAERA, NI Water, coastal local authorities, Keep Northern Ireland Beautul, the National Trust, Surfers Against Sewage and some coastal community groups.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke said he delighted that Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches have recognised as having excellent water, but expressed disappointment that Newcastle was only placed in the ldquosufficient standard, despite major investment by NI Water in the resortrsquos sewage treatment works.He said there was an onus on Newry Mourne and Down Council to work with its statutory partners to improve the water quality, suggesting this yearrsquos warm bathing season should have helped prevent pollutants from being flushed down rivers and out to sea.ldquoWe need to establish what were the reasons for Newcastlersquos water quality to have only secured a sufficient water quality standard, Cllr Clarke continued.ldquoThe tourism industry relies on its beaches and water quality and more needs to be done to ensure this is as good as it can and should be.

The newly-formed Ballynahinch United played in a local summer league which involved teams such as Montalto, Drumaness Mills, Plessey, Saintfield, Magheradroll and another called the Bachelors, who apparently had an Italian playing for them.The club made their competitive debut in Division  of the Newcastle and District League in September  when they travelled to Ballykinlar Army Camp to take on the Light Infantry.This fixture would prove to be quite an ordeal in many ways with the team being beaten - as player and car owner Ted McKibbin had to make double journeys to ferry players to and from Ballykinlar.Not a single league victory was recorded that season, although they won a number of friendly games.Although the   season started more optimistically with a - draw away to Down Olympic, it was a further seven games until they defeated the RAF at Bishopscourt -. During the summer of  the team won all eight games to win the Kilmore and District Summer League.Things improved signicantly in the   season as they were promoted as runners-up in Division  and also won the Enterprise Cup, which was played on a league basis, beating Saintfield AYC ndash in the replay after a - draw in the first match.The Swts were formed for the   season and they played in the Willowfield League recording their first win against Saintfield United on October , .Having been promoted to Division  of the Newcastle  District League, they won it at the first attempt and with the Swts moving to the Newcastle League for the   season, both teams performed a unique double by winning Divisions  and  while United reached and lost the Harry Clarke Cup final.United went to the Northern Amateur Football League for the   season and were promoted from Division B and they also reached the Irish Junior Cup only to lose to Moyola Park. They won the Division A title in  In the   season they lost the Irish Junior Cup final to st Bangor Old Boys while the Swts were probably the first reserve team to reach the Harry Clarke Cup Final which they lost after a replay to Downshire Hospital.Consecutive Cochrane Corry Cup finals were lost in   and  , as well as a second County Antrim Junior Shield final in .Manager Billy Hamilton, who had guided the team through the s so successfully, stood down at the end of the   season and then went on to become secretary of the County Antrim Football Association for a number of years. The playing strength within the club led to the formation of the Albion, in .In the mid s Ballynahinch Recreation folded. United took over the Millbridge playing fields and undertook signicant development work which led to it being admitted to Division C of the Northern Amateur Football League.Under the management of Bobbie Reid, they played their first games at intermediate level in the   season while the Swts switched to the NAFL reserve section, However the Albion remained in the Newcastle League.Success came quickly when Brian McKibbenrsquos team won the Border Regiment Cup in the   season after extra-time and penalties. Brian stood down as manager in  and through the efforts of Gerry McCormick and Cyril Lennon mid-table league positions were achieved.Under the leadership of club chairman Campbell Allen, great strides were being made with improvements to the drainage of the pitch, erection of tubular steel fencing around the pitch, construction of new dugouts and the erection of floodlighting to the training pitch with the clubhouse being substantially refurbished.For the   season Noel Dean was recruited as manager and he steered the team to their first and only promotion at intermediate level when they moved from Division B to A as runners-up to Dromara Village.The following season a mid-table position was achieved together with a memorable midweek Irish Cup replay defeat of Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge.Dean stepped down during the season and he was replaced by Michael Savage, who led the team to the final of the Clarence Cup which they were awarded as a result of Knockbreda Parish fielding an ineligible player.That same season the Swts, under manager Geoffrey Smith, lost the Purdy Cup final while Davy Teggartyrsquos Albion won the Bignian Cup and were also promoted to Division  as runners-up. Sadly, this team broke up and there followed a decade of struggle during which managers Eamon Wilson, Norman McCullough, Davy Teggarty and Alan Brown worked tirelessly to halt the downward trend.The occasional bit of encouragement came along with the Albion reaching two successive Shimna Cup finals in   and   only to lose out in penalty shoot-outs while in   the Albion won the Donard Dairy Shield defeating Castlewellan IIIs ndash.Campbell Allen stepped down due to business commitments and the current chairman Gilbert Cromie took over.In May  the club were awarded the honour of hosting the Britton Rosebowl International between the NAFL and the Scottish Amateur League at Millbridge.Nigel Neale managed the team for the   season, but resigned with ten matches remaining. Experienced first teamer Alan Stevens took over, assisted by John Jones, and they led the team to one of their highest finishes in years.Former manager Cyril Lennon came in for the   season and United enjoyed their highest league position for years. Stuart Buchanan came in as manager of the Swts and led them to the Newcastle  District League Division A title.The following season United again narrowly missed out on promotion, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Intermediate Cup when they were defeated by Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge. The Swts re-entered the Northern Amateur League and were promoted as runners-up in Division E to Bangor Rangers.Much to everyonersquos disappointment, Cyril Lennon stepped down and Steven Bell took over along with John Jones and they led the team to a very respectable fourth place in Division B. United were awarded the North East Referees Association Merit Award for Fair Play at the AGM of the NAFL.The Swts continued their good form to finish runners-up to Downpatrick IIs in NAFL D, but manager Stuart Buchanan stepped down due to study commitments.In the summer of  the club celebrated its th anniversary which a special former playersrsquo night and a friendly match against Irish Premier League side Lisburn Distillery. The Albion managed by Johnny Reid won Division  of the Newcastle  District League.In   the club was awarded a % grant from the IFA to undertake an upgrading of its facilities to meet new Intermediate regulations.Steven Bell stood down in January . A new management team of Colin Murray and John Jones took over the role and they guided the first team to a fourth place finish on goal dference. Much to the clubrsquos disappointment the Albion had to be withdrawn from the Newcastle League due to a reduction in the clubrsquos player pool.In the   season the club embarked on its usual Irish Cup campaign little knowing that it would reach the fth round for the first time and be drawn against Premier Division side Coleraine. This brought about a wonderful adventure during which the club was able to garner a massive support which necessitated the ordering of two double decker buses for supporters as well as a bus for the team.Everything was done as professionally as possible and despite a heavy defeat, although the score was - at half time, the players and their management gained enormous respect.In more recent times the team has been managed by Keith Hamilton, Scott Brashaw and Ross Hayes as caretaker managers, Alan Davis and Paul Allison. In the current season, former player Glynn Robinson and Dale Davidson have taken on the role and have made a promising start with good results in both league and cup competition.Over the last  years the club has been involved in a number of proposed amalgamation initiatives involving Ballynahinch Recreation, Ballynahinch Olympic and Temple Rangers, but none materialised.One amalgamation that did happen was with Ballynahinch Youth Football Club, which now means that the club includes male and female from age six years forward and a ladiesrsquo senior team. This fits in superbly with the clubrsquos ethos of being inclusive to all within the local community which has been something that is reflected in its history from day one.It also brought to the club an outstanding group of coaches and administrators which has invigorated the club.No club could everwithout committed iniduals being involved in its organisation and the club has had a cadre of them over five decades.The passing of the clubrsquos elder statesman, Billy Hamilton senior, in December  brought to an end outstanding service not only within the club as a player and administrator, but also within the leagues and governing bodies.Billy was no stranger to working hard on the ground, putting up nets and marking the pitch both at Feersquos Field in Dromara and Millbridge, aided and abetted by club president Winston Brown, who works away in the background and has done so for  years.Jimmy Brown has toiled tirelessly and selflessly for well over  years, keeping Millbridge well-manicured as well as using his building, plumbing and plastering skills to maximum effect.In addition to Billy senior, the Hamilton family have made an outstanding contribution with Billy junior managing for over a decade. Graham scored hundreds of goals over those early years while Wilson mdash better known to all as Chico mdash played for all three teams and continues to serve as a committee member to the present day.We can never forget the contribution that Sally Hamilton has made as she continues to attend the home matches and has made the sandwiches served to visiting teams at the Millbridge for decades. In addition to managing the team and being involved administratively with the club, Bobbie Reid has served as the clubrsquos Newcastle League representative for many years. Last, but not least, there is Davy Teggarty, who has fulfilled every role possible.While all of these iniduals and others have helped over the years we are most fortunate to have a new generation who have stepped forward and will see the club move forward for which we are extremely thankful..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Peace lantern walk marking WWI end 100th anniversary  ","story":"A UNIQUE peace lantern walk is to be held in Killyleagh to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.The lantern will be carried in a relay chain from Shrigley to Killyleagh, and through its main streets, before a flame from it is used to light a gas beacon at the front of Killyleagh Castle on Remembrance night.A Killyleagh veteran, who is one of Northern Irelandrsquos last RAF survivors from the Second World War, has been given the honour of carrying the lantern on the final relay before the Beacon of Light is lit.Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who is aged  and who survived more than  bombing missions as a rear gunner in Halax and Lancaster bombers in the Second World War, will light the beacon to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent in  after four years of the world at war.The Bomber Command veteran who still walks up to six miles a day and is one of Killyleaghrsquos most instantly recognisable residents, will be joined in the final relay of the cross-community walk by local schoolchildren and  unsung heroes from the local community.The Killyleagh Beacon of Light will be among the first of around  bonfires and beacons to be lit across Northern Ireland at pm at the end of Remembrance Sunday, as part of the Battlersquos Over commemorations on Sunday, November .Chris Hagan, the chairman of the Killyleagh Remembers the Great War project, revealed that an original candle and lantern, used on the th anniversary of the start of the war, will be used as part of a chain to light the beacon.ldquoWe extinguished a candle lantern in August  to mark  years from the beginning of the war, he said. ldquoIn remembrance of the end of the war and the millions who were killed or came home dreadfully wounded, the lantern will be lit again.ldquoThere were two bonfires lit in Killyleagh on the night the war ended at the Castle Square and at the Cross.

Armagh were largely at full strength with influential number  Neil Faloon passed fit.Armagh took an early lead with a penalty from promising young out-half Cormac Fox.The game then became entrenched around the halfway line with both sides either unwilling or unable to put any width on the ball due to the conditions.Armagh edged the possession and territory, but with defences well drilled on both sides it looked like only a mistake would provide any try-scoring opportunity on either side.There were a few fumbles from speculative kicks on both sides but defences were able to scramble into place and snuff out any chances relatively comfortably to leave the half-time score at -.The second half brought more of the same. Ballynahinch had to withstand a period of sustained Armagh possession, but did so without any major alarms.However, they were unable to stamp any real authority of their own on proceedings and as the match drted into its later stages it seemed that Armagh had done enough to escape with a famous win.Former Armagh man Richard Reaney had other ideas and he converted a penalty in the final minute to earn the home side a draw.Armagh will be happier with the result, but the Ballynahinch players and coaches will take the two points and move on to the tricky trip to Old Belvedere next week.The final round of the Celtic Cup took place last weekend, freeing up Ulster squad members for club rugby, but it remains to be seen how soon they become available. The depth of the club squad will continue to be tested over the coming weeks.Ballynahinch City of Armagh ALL-IRELAND LEAGUE DIVISON B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Red Bull Racing bringing Formula 1 car to City of Merchants Festival  ","story":"A TOP Formula  racing team is coming to Newry as part of the forthcoming City of Merchants Festival.Aston Martin Red Bull Racing will be bringing one of its famous F cars to Marcus Square on Sunday, November , between pm and pm.The eagerly awaited visit has been organised by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with First Derivatives and Newry Business Improvement District.Council chairman Mark Murnin said: ldquoThis is a great high-octane addition to an already action-packed City of Merchants weekend.ldquoUnleashing the spectacle of F for fans across the district is fantastic, and we are thrilled that Newry is one of its pit stop destinations during its travels around Northern Ireland.Louise Cunningham, Vice-President of Marketing at First Derivatives said: ldquoWe are delighted to welcome Aston Martin Red Bull Racing to our hometown of Newry.Over the last year, we have been building upon our partnership and supporting the team with data analysis for off track projects helping the development of its  cars.

A number of parked cars have also been damaged.It is being reported that some shops have closed early to protect staff, while residents who live near the historic Grove area in the shadow of Down Cathedral have revealed they have been verbally abused.Representatives from residentsrsquo groups in Stream Street, Bridge Street, Russell Park and Lynn Doyle Place have been invited to attend the meeting which they hope will result in an action plan being devised to tackle a problem caused by what some have described as ldquoferal youths.Grove Shopping Centre caretaker Peter Smyth, said businesses were frustrated that nothing is being done to address the problems and wanted local police to do more.ldquoBusinesses have had to pull down shutters either temporarily or shut early to protect staff in the St Patrickrsquos Square area, he said.ldquoWhile the trouble is largely centred on area between the Grove, the Saint Patrick Centre and the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, it radiates out to town centre neighbourhoods and last week a number of young people climbed on to the roof at the nearby bus station.Anthony Trainor, of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, said local people, including those who work in the town centre, have had their cars deliberately damaged.ldquoResidentsrsquo groups are telling us that there have been assaults on adults and children.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The historic passage across the Atlantic from Londonderry to what was a strongly English Puritan colony was sounded out by Macosquin cleric the Rev William Boyd, who was sent ahead to view the land of their adoption. Boyd presented a petition to the Massachusetts governor seeking a portion of land to be allocated to the Bann Valley Presbyterians and his report back was highly favourable.Reasons for the emigration were not founded on materialism, but on matters of faith, “to avoid oppression, shun persecution and secure freedom of worship”. Under Anglican authority, Ulster-Scots Presbyterians did not enjoy these freedoms. The Presbyterians, who travelled in four sailing ships, were led by the Rev James McGregor, minister of Aghadowey Church, who had been at the - Siege of Londonderry and was a straight-talking and inspiring pastor to his people. These folk were weavers, bleachers, and artisans, who spoke “pure Scotch” as one might hear in any part of Ayrshire and Argyllshire. They were “civilised, God-fearing industrious people”. McGregor’s text on the eve-of-departure from Aghadowey was: “If thy presence go not with me, carry us up not hence”. His hard-hitting farewell sermon was a broadside at the episcopacy in Ireland. However, the Puritans in Massachusetts were hostile to the Bann Valley folk, who were forced to move on to Casco Bay, near present-day Portland, Maine. Eventually, they made it to New Hampshire, developing churches in townships that became known as Londonderry and Coleraine.The McGregor-led exodus out of Ulster to America is a rich part of Ulster-Scots history and the movement’s anniversary has been meaningfully recognised this year on both sides of the Atlantic.This week, as an author on th century Ulster migration to America, I was privileged to travel to the United States, courtesy of the Irish consulate in Atlanta, to speak on the signicance of the McGregor passage and the legacy it heralded and sustained in American society. On Wednesday night, I spoke at First Knoxville Presbyterian Church, Tennessee and, yesterday morning, at Trinity Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, Georgia. My American audiences were welcoming and appreciative of this signicant milestone. Scots-Irish Presbyterian legacy runs deep in many parts of the United States, strongly influencing, over  years, the religious and political mantra of the nation.RHI Inquiry: One Stormont department misled another over crisis Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Photo: Photo Jean-Francois Badias Dublin is pressing for EU customs checks to treat the island of Ireland has a single unit, whereas unionists would prefer a “frictionless” soft border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland which makes no distintion between the Province and the rest of the UK.But Mr Swann said he “continue[s] to be disappointed by the intransigent language of Leo Varadkar and the Irish Government” over the issue.“If they continue to hold to the position that it’s either a border in the Irish Sea or no deal, it is likely to have dire consequences on both sides of the border in terms of both economies and relationships across these islands,” he said.“When I wrote to the Taoiseach earlier this year challenging the position which his government was taking, he responded to me saying that the Irish Government would ‘uphold and protect the letter and spirit of that Agreement’. Unfortunately, there has been little sign of that so far as he continues to push a backstop proposal which has no regard for the Belfast Agreement and the principle of consent.“I would respectfully ask the Taoiseach, along with his EU colleagues, to use the coming weeks as a window of opportunity to reflect on what they are doing and engage in negotiations which are injected with a dose of realism. Breaking the Belfast Agreement to facilitate the backstop proposal is definitely not a sensible way forward.”Mr Swann affirmed Theresa May’s actions in asking for more time to effect Brexit.“The Prime Minister was absolutely right to hold her ground and not allow the UK Government to be bounced into doing a bad deal which would threaten the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom,” he said.“There is now a window of opportunity for everyone to take stock and for the EU to go back to the drawing board. Theresa May has asked the EU for flexibility and they should give her that. It is in everyone’s interests to get a sensible deal that respects the result of the referendum, that doesn’t undermine the Belfast Agreement and maintains a frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland.”‘Leo Varadkar now reveals true goal for Northern Ireland’Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8674094.1539929353!/image/image.jpg","title":"ni ex serviceman offers to educate misguided cambridge university students about remembrance  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+          TriggerPrompt url  http:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude +url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           NI ex-serviceman offers to educate lsquomisguidedrsquo Cambridge University students about remembrance   Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...BRIGHTCOVE.createBrightcovePlayerInstance Duncan ElderEmail Published::Friday  October Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"conflicts, war and peace\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .html  .html.valA Northern Ireland councillor has offered to travel to Cambridge at his own expense to educate #ignorant and offensive# university students who rejected Remembrance Day events as glorying war.Mid and East Antrim DUP Councillor Billy Henry, who served in the Armed Forces for more than  years, was outraged when Cambridge University’s Student Union recently rejected a motion to promote Remembrance Day on the basis that it “glories” conflict.    Cllr Billy Henry pictured at the recent rededication of Ballymena and District War Memorial. The -year-old Cullybackey man, a member of the Royal British Legion, described students who voted against the motion, which also encouraged the commemoration of British veterans, as “ignorant and offensive” and accused them of snubbing Remembrance Day.Stressing that he would be happy to pay his own way over to Cambridgethe union would invite him to meet with students, councillor Henry told the News Letter: “If they invite me over I’d be more than happy to go over because I think what’s been done shows a lack of education on their part. “For anyone to suggest that the poppy glories war is absolutely ludicrous and I think it’s about time they realised exactly what the poppy does represent.”The motion, which was put forward by two members of the university’s Conservative Association, called on the students’ union to “encourage the commemoration of British war veterans on Remembrance Day across the University of Cambridge.” But both the motion, and a proposed amendment to broaden the commemoration to “all those whose lives have been affected by war across the University of Cambridge”, were rejected.   Cllr Billy Henry pictured at Ballymena and District War Memorial. Instead, an amendment which noted the efforts of ious organisations to “reshape remembrance away from glorication and valorisation of war” and to campaign “against militarism” was passed on October .It is understood that, in spite of the move, representatives of Cambridge University’s Student Union will still lay wreaths at a Remembrance Sunday event.Describing the union’s vote as “appalling ignorance and an insult to our nation’s war dead”, councillor Henry continued: “This is a hugely signicant and poignant year – the centenary of the Armistice – and events are planned throughout the UK to remember all of those who made the ultimate sacrice.“The vast majority of right-minded people will pause to reflect and pay their respects over this time. It’s a sad indictment on a tiny minority of idiots, including those at Cambridge University Student Union who fail to have the brains or decency to do likewise.“I urge them to urgently reconsider this deeply offensive decision which has already caused great damage to this university’s reputation. “I will gladly travel to Cambridge and educate these misguided young people on the ultimate sacrice made by so many that they may live the privileged lives many of them currently do. As George Santayana said: ‘Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it’.”The Bannside representative recently led a successful campaign to have the names of  local people who lost their lives during the First World War added to Ballymena and District War Memorial.Historic Presbyterian trek from Ulster in Fear that Troubles trauma could be passed on to next generation Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He said he intends to raise the issue of the students’ “shameful Remembrance Day snub” at the next full meeting of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council on November .try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It consists of three workshops: Creating a Winning Mind Winning in Communication and Winning in Business.It also includes a practical component participants must organise and produce a fundraiser event in their pub for a charity of their choice. To date the  Accelerators have raised more than pound, for UK charities between them.The guests were given a tour of the House of Commons before the main event, hosted by Luton MP Gavin Shuker. Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I said lsquoWell, dude, I actually lost itrsquo, and he was like lsquoReally rsquo.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
