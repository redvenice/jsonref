We are seeing the responses we’ve grown to expect in a crisis: intensification of surveillance, rolling back of protections and financial support for irresponsible industries, to name a few. And this is amid inadequate protection of workers, monopolizing of mask equipment, anti-labor retaliation, industry opportunism, staggering unemployment and more.At the same time, other responses have revealed something most of us already knew (or at least suspected) – the arbitrariness of American misery. Regressive policies and enforcement procedures are being scaled back in surprising numbers. While sectors under federal control – immigration policy, higher education, healthcare, election reform – have had few Covid-related changes, those controlled by city and state governments – criminal justice, housing, transportation, utilities – have had many.These changes were put in place to slow viral transmission and stabilize the economy, not to benefit social welfare. But what’s interesting is how much overlap there is between them. Sector by sector, the pandemic has unintentionally sparked changes pushed by reformers for decades. What couldn’t be done in years has now happened in a matter of weeks. Policy changes that before Covid were dismissed as unreasonable are now seen not only as reasonable but as necessary.It shows us how absurd so many of our rules were to begin with. But does it also show us how easy they’ve been to change all along?Many of these changes still don’t go far enough, come with caveats and fine print, are subject to absurd means-testing, or are only temporary. For those of us who believe that America needs serious change – and that this is the time to do it – what will it take to make many of these temporary changes permanent? These aren’t necessarily the changes we want, but they give us a glimpse of what’s possible.We are collecting more of these examples at pandemicpolicy.us. You can fill out the Google forms sheet here.To prevent people from leaving their homes during the outbreak, many cities and states – such as Florida, New York, San Francisco, New Orleans, Oakland, Seattle and Philadelphia – are temporarily suspending mortgage payments and residential evictions. All but 10 states have passed emergency tenant protections.The same cannot be said for measures to suspend rent, which affects far more people nationwide. Organized rent strikes have popped up around the country, with 60 ongoing strikes in California alone.Eviction suspensions help, but they don’t eliminate the rent burden – tenants will still have to make up payments, even with lost income. That means that evictions are still on the horizon, only delayed.For people without housing, there’s been a movement to provide shelter, albeit temporary, in vacant or currently empty spaces, such as nursing homes in Connecticut and hotels in San Francisco. Other shelters have been made in New Orleans, Virginia, Los Angeles and throughout the rest of California.However, for the unhoused – who are already among the most vulnerable to infection – these expanded shelters are only temporary (and have problems of their own), while existing shelters are unsafe and overcrowded. Meanwhile, landlords have been recorded kicking people out of their homes after testing positive.Access to water is always essential, but especially in managing a pandemic. In cities like Detroit, where water access has been a longstanding issue, water shutoffs have been suspended and service is being restored. Similar suspensions have occurred throughout almost 90 other cities and states.Water access remains a problem elsewhere. Two-fifths of Americans currently rely on water utilities which have not suspended shutoffs. In Flint, the government has cited the pandemic in its decision to delay the long-overdue replacement of lead pipes.Many electric and gas companies are suspending shutoffs as well. More than 20 states have issued government orders to halt disconnections, and utility companies in places such as Georgia, Nevada, California, New York and New Jersey have chosen to suspend disconnections.With the magnified importance of digital connectivity, internet service providers have also agreed to suspend service shutoffs and in some cases have removed data caps as well as speed caps used by ISPs to purposely slow down internet speeds. The Federal Communications Commission has also requested that internet service providers find a way to provide free broadband to those who normally don’t have access.In all of these cases, these services are recognized as essential, and so consistent access to them has been prioritized throughout the crisis. But they are no less essential even under “normal” circumstances. So why is access limited then?With the goal of increasing social distancing and slowing the spread of Covid in overpopulated prisons, the pandemic has inadvertently sparked changes that criminal justice reformers have been pushing for years.Police departments in cities such as Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Denver and Nashville have reduced arrests, whether by opting not to go after low-level misdemeanors, issuing civil summons in lieu of arrests, or choosing to warn people rather than arrest them.To reduce “jail churn” – the large numbers of people going in and out of local jails – many district attorney offices have decided not to prosecute low-level offenses that are not considered a threat to public safety. They have also released people from pre-trial detention, where about 550,000 unconvicted people sat in US jails in 2020, most because they were too poor to post bail.Meanwhile, across the US, jails and prisons have halted new admissions and have released people not considered a threat to public safety, such as detainees held on minor offenses in Alabama, 1,700 people convicted of non-violent misdemeanors with fewer than 30 days left on their sentence in Los Angeles, incarcerated pregnant mothers in Chicago, and 900 non-violent inmates, including the sick and elderly, from a Cleveland jail considered so “inhumane” that it prompted an FBI investigation last year. “Where we are right now is where we should have been all along,” said the presiding municipal judge.But if all these people aren’t a threat to public safety, why are they being arrested and detained in the first place?Access to social services in the US is notorious for its byzantine bureaucratic maze of means testing and other barriers. To reduce contact, programs like Snap and WIC no longer require in-person interviews. In Utah, work requirements for Medicaid have been suspended.Elsewhere, services have been expanded, such as public childcare centers in San Francisco or providing free meals in New York and Los Angeles, outgrowths of initiatives put in place after school closures deprived many students of meals they relied on. (Interestingly, America’s free meal programs took off with the Black Panther party’s Free Breakfast for Children program, which not only provided meals to students but also organized communities.)There have also been a number of cash transfer program proposals to provide financial relief (a breakdown of the proposals is here), many of which would have been unheard of just a few weeks ago.Unfortunately these proposals took the form of the recently passed Cares Act, which is both insufficient and means-tested. Its passage, however, further demonstrates that the “how will you pay for it” question is more about stopping progressive policies than genuine concern.As hospitals lack beds and equipment and millions of Americans lose their jobs – and thus their health insurance – the inadequacies and cruelty of the American healthcare system (if not already obvious) is now undeniable. However, to keep up with increased need, outdated restrictions have been relaxed or lifted.In New York, people with foreign medical degrees are now allowed to provide hospital care – foreign-trained medical workers with advanced degrees are often relegated to low-wage, precarious work, such as driving for Uber, because their degrees aren’t recognized in the US. Restrictions on medical workers working across state lines have been relaxed as well, while archaic restrictions on blood donation from gay men have been eased (though not entirely removed).As the world scrambles for Covid-19 treatments, the pharmaceutical industry has tried to secure exclusive rights on anything that looks promising. Gilead, notorious among other things for its $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, applied for and received orphan drug status for its possible Covid-19 treatment remdesivir, a status normally reserved for drugs that treat rare illnesses (Gilead later walked back the claim).At the same time, Eli Lilly capped insulin costs to $35 in response to the pandemic. Normally, Eli Lilly’s (and other manufacturers’) insulin is so unaffordable that people die from rationing it to save money.To maintain productivity throughout the pandemic, many employers previously resistant to remote work arrangements are suddenly open to them. The expansion of remote work has been a long-denied demand of disabled workers, but only now are employers willing to consider it.Companies such as Amazon, Walmart, Instacart and Uber have revised their sick leave policies to include employees who are typically denied such benefits. But in basically all cases, this sick leave is accessible only after testing positive for Covid-19 (a difficult requirement given the scarcity of tests) and in the absence of other necessities like protective equipment and hazard pay.Companies such as Uber persistently resist classification of their drivers as proper employees, and this very limited expansion of benefits is not really a substantial change away from that policy. At the very least, however, the recently passed Cares Act expands unemployment benefits to independent contractors.Education has been fundamentally reshaped as schools move online, with educators scrambling to adjust teaching styles and materials to remote learning. Many university presses have made their titles accessible for free in response. But most notable is the admittedly tiny – but unprecedented – shift in the system of indebtedness that American higher education system is built on.New York has suspended state debt collection, including student and medical debt. At the federal level, initially a far more modest suspension of interest accrual for federal loans was announced, but was updated to suspend payments and collections as well.This still pales in comparison to measures taken by other countries, such as Venezuela, which announced country-wide six-month rent and credit payment freezes. In the US, private lenders are not required to take any such measures.Yet these moves seem to at least tacitly acknowledge the social harms of widespread debt burdens. This has not, however, stopped the debt collection industry from trying to claim itself “essential”.City living is hugely influenced by access to reliable and affordable transit. Increased access to mobility has long been an important issue, but only now are we seeing changes.With pushback against fare hikes and ailing infrastructure already an issue before Covid, cities such as Houston, Cincinnati, New York and Santa Monica have suspended bus fares, and some bike-share services are offering free rides, such as in Detroit, Memphis and Kansas City. However, this is against a backdrop of insufficient protective measures for transit workers, some of whom have already died from Covid-19 infection.Many cities have opened streets to pedestrians by implementing car bans, such as Philadelphia, St Paul, Cleveland and Denver, to provide space for cyclists and pedestrians to maintain social distancing, part of an ongoing movement to pedestrianize roads permanently.There’s been little change on the immigration front, but US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) recently announced it would “temporarily adjust its enforcement posture” to arrest only “public safety risks and iniduals subject to mandatory detention” – in other words, they would stop rounding up and deporting people just for being undocumented.Advocates and federal judges in Los Angeles and Pennsylvania ordered the federal government to release detainees, but there’s been no answer from the Trump administration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71163a21b32737e2c6151a31390bcb16ecce951a/0_0_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ab4a5882cec60f04c62e2244d59755d","title":"people work lockdown herd immunity debate coronavirus","story":"So far we haven’t had the evidence to truly judge leaders and their coronavirus policies. With policies easing, we soon willThe trickle is starting. Spain, Austria, Italy, China, possibly Germany and the US will this week begin, however hesitantly, the great return to work. As others hold back and some may even toughen lockdowns, the result will be the most extraordinary mass experiment in history.The outcome should go some way to settle the central argument of coronavirus policy, of lockdown and suppression v mitigation and herd immunity. It will also condition a later political blame game, who was right and who was wrong.Statistics are in chaos. Death “rates” lag behind deaths. Deaths are confused with “hospital deaths”. Headlines highlight “most cases per nation” or “most deaths per nation”, not deaths per million. Yet we are at the mercy of these statistics. They are the raw material of the modellers, and their models are the sacred entrails into which policymakers peer each day, to see what level of lockdown to impose on their people.Not surprisingly, science is giving way to value judgments. Authoritarian regimes are erging from libertarian ones. Countries in total lockdown (Spain and France) are compared with countries practising social distancing (Sweden and Korea) and those such as Turkey and Brazil which do none of those things. As David McCoy said in the  last week, we simply don’t have models that balance “the direct, visible and dramatic harms of Covid-19 with the more indirect, chronic and hidden social and economic harms of lockdown”.I assume that hard evidence will now start to emerge. There will be a wide comparative spectrum, of outliers and controls. We should learn to what degree were face masks and two-metre separation efficacious, as against mass isolation and economic collapse. So far, such evidence is in desperately short supply. Soon it will be on the ground, in the world’s factories and on its pavements.Economics has taken a terrible battering this last month, because it is thought to put “money before lives”. But all options cost lives, which is why political judgment has moved to centre stage. Businesses are ruined, dreams shattered, people die. As in the conundrum of the swerving driver, do you avoid one death now, but is it at the cost of five down the road?The cliche is true. Only time will tell, but that time starts now. The task is to scrutinise the evidence and let it tell the truth, not just the truth we want it to tell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abe73c8e58fb68cee246b9d3913fadba5aa96e3c/0_0_3024_4032/master/3024.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7fd511da090f533163948e0b687ab2f 880w","title":"disney bob iger to stay as ceo during coronavirus pandemic","story":"Iger puts semi-retirement on hold to help entertainment group weather crisisDisney’s Bob Iger has postponed semi-retirement to retake control of the entertainment group as it braces for changes caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Iger’s 15-year stint as chief executive was due to come to an end this year, with Bob Chapek, the head of Disney’s theme park business, unveiled as his successor in February.But Iger, who had already said he would not take his $3m (£2.4m) salary during the pandemic, has decided to remain at the helm to help steer Disney through a period of unprecedented turmoil that is reportedly costing the company $30m a day.“A crisis of this magnitude, and its impact on Disney, would necessarily result in my actively helping Bob and the company contend with it,” Iger told the New York Times.Disney has been losing hundreds of millions of dollars in income from its theme parks and cruise liner businesses because of the pandemic.Analysts have estimated that the company could be facing an 11-million fall in visitor numbers across its theme parks, at a potential cost of $500m. Iger has suggested that visitors could be subjected to temperature checks when the theme parks reopen.The company has also been forced to postpone film releases after the closure of cinemas in its most lucrative markets.Disney borrowed $6bn in March to help the company through the pandemic and has said it would furlough more than 70,000 employees from 19 April, including most of the staff at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California.Reports in the US have suggested some of the cuts could become permanent once the crisis abates and come amid speculation that consumer habits could be altered for good by the pandemic.The company’s streaming service Disney+, which was launched five months ago, has attracted tens of millions of subscribers during lockdown.Iger, who was planning to remain executive chairman until the end of 2021, has indicated that Disney could withdraw from more financially risky activity such as TV pilots and move more of its content towards the fast-growing streaming service.However, he said any decisions on whether the reorganisation would require job losses would be required would be left to his successor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae56757fad8bdc345bba6cbc5e7d1939cb1c3d6a/0_197_8031_4817/master/8031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f05b5743ab9fcf1095a53406eac6dff","title":"rachel roddy recipe leftover spaghetti frittata","story":"A locked-down Roman kitchen makes enterprising use of leftover pasta in a moreish spaghetti ‘fry-up’ topped with lots of cheeseHow many people does it take to turn a frittata di pasta? Here, at the moment, two. We discuss (argue) about when exactly, and whether a pan lid or a plate is better for inverting, and which of us used a pan scrub on the nonstick pan. It wasn’t me. Lockdown has concentrated everything, reduced our stocks and patience. It has also concentrated the importance of leftovers, or, as a friend calls them, “leave-that-alone-don’t-eat-it-it-is-for-tomorrow’s-lunch”.With most frittate – potato, asparagus, onion, bottom-of-the-fridge – the ingredients are held together by the egg. With a frittata di pasta, it is the other way round: the egg is held by the pasta. That isn’t to say that the eggs in frittata di pasta aren’t glue – they are, adhering to the strands of spaghetti like mud in a bird’s nest, but without encasing the whole thing. This means that, instead of a heavy yellow frame, the edges are made by the curves of spaghetti which, like snags in a sweater, poke and stick out, toasting as the frittata fries – which is the other difference: while most frittate are soft, frittata di pasta (at least the way we like it) is firmer,  bronzed and has toasted edges.The first way is with no additions: you simply take your leftover spaghetti (let’s say ours is with tomato sauce) and put it into a nonstick pan in which you have heated a little oil, press it down and fry until “arrustacata, ben rosolata e croccante, bruciacchiata” – “well browned and crunchy, scorched”. His description of a seafood pasta arruscata is even better: he heats the leftover pasta first, tossing it around and adding a spoonful of grated pecorino before he presses it into the pan, so the pasta takes on colour and the seafood (I am imagining a fat mussel here) catches and caramelises. This note reminds me of cooking with chef Jeremy Lee, him daring me to fry the rabbit longer, fry the courgette in batter deeper, reminding me that a catching is very often the way to catch flavour, which in turn catches the eater.The second way to make frittata di pasta is to mix the leftover pasta with egg and grated cheese. If you have saved unsauced pasta, you need to be even more diligent with seasoning here.Whereas soft frittate go well with a crisp salad, frittata di pasta with toasted edges demands the opposite: a salad made with floppy eared butterhead lettuce, for example, two of which I have in the fridge. I like a French dressing with a soft green salad: six tablespoons of olive oil, one of vinegar, and one of dijon, shaken in a jar until it is cloudy yellow. Vincenzo likes oil and lemon. Something to “discuss” later.200g day-old, cold spaghetti (plain or with tomato sauce)3 eggs3 tbsp grated parmesan or pecorinoSalt and black pepper3 tbsp diced mozzarella or other melting cheese (optional)Butter and oil, for fryingBreak the eggs into a bowl and whisk. Add the cheese, salt and plenty of pepper, and whisk again. Add the spaghetti and cubed cheese, and stir until the pasta is well coated with egg.Heat a little olive oil and butter over a medium-high flame, until the butter is foaming, tip the mixture into the pan and fry, stirring, for minute.Press down on the mixture to even it out in the pan, turn down the heat to medium and leave to cook for two minutes, then use a plate to invert the frittata and fry on the other side until golden.

Close your eyes and think about what it conjures up for you. For me, it’s Greece, where I once ate a plate of them drowning in a rich tomato sauce, strewn with wild oregano and the most delicious, creamy feta. The sun was slipping behind the hills, bathing an olive tree in a particularly golden light. Did I dream the heavy-laden, long-lashed donkey walking past? I’m feasting off dreams like these at the moment – and on Greek meatballs, which I’ve recreated at home.This recipe is simple and the meat requires no browning.

Season with half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper and leave to cook for at least 20-25 minutes, until it is sweet and delicious.Meanwhile, squeeze out any excess water from the breadcrumbs and empty into a medium-size mixing bowl. Use your hands to mix in the garlic, oregano and lamb mince, and season generously. Shape into golf balls and arrange in an even layer in the simmering tomato sauce, gently pushing them down so they are immersed in the sauce.

Crumble the feta over the meatballs and grill for a few minutes, until the feta begins to break down and colour.

Is it possible to find out, and how should you behave if you think you may have been infected? Dr William Hillmann: Antibody tests are being developed but are not in widespread clinical use yet. The antibody testing would allow us to check blood samples for antibodies against coronavirus to tell whether somebody had had it. I, and I think many others, are anxiously awaiting for those to become available.Hillmann: Coronavirus is actually quite a significant spectrum of symptoms, from people who are entirely asymptomatic and would have no idea that they have it to people with very mild, cold-like symptoms – runny nose, congestion, sore throat – to people with more flu-like symptoms – high fevers, muscle aches, shortness of breath and cough. Loss of smell and taste are also symptoms. All the way up to people with severe illness, who we’re seeing in the hospital with respiratory failure, requiring ICU care. It’s impossible right now to say what the true prevalence of the disease in the US is since we are still prioritizing testing for people who are sick or in the hospital or who are healthcare workers. We’re not doing widespread testing that South Korea and some European countries have done to get a sense of how many people are asymptomatic or have such minimal symptoms that they attribute it to allergies or something else.When people are symptomatic, they’re contagious. A day or two before they become symptomatic, they’re likely contagious as well. A virus builds up and starts to shed, and then after symptoms resolve, people can still be contagious for a couple of days. We have some evidence of viral shed even a couple of weeks after symptoms are resolved. It’s hard to know if that’s actual live virus, which is still able to infect somebody, or if that’s just dead virus that the body is shedding.Dr David Buchholz: We all have to be role models. If we’re all in it together, we all should be doing social distancing.Hillmann: Since there’s no real way to know at this point who might have had it, unless you’re symptomatic, you get a swab and are definitively diagnosed with it, I would just act as if you hadn’t had it. Keep doing all of those things that we all should be doing at this point: social distancing and hand hygiene. I think universal mask-wearing in public is a reasonable recommendation based on what we know about the wide spectrum of symptoms, and the fact that people can be asymptomatic and still be shedding the virus.Buchholz: I would, absolutely. I’m in New York, and it was definitely in the community before we knew it. So, yeah, any family members and close friends, maybe somebody you work next to, I think I would just alert them, especially if it was in the last 14 days. If it’s been more than 14 days, they would have gotten sick by now if they had significant exposure.Hillmann: It’s up to every inidual about what they feel is right. That being said, with the surge in infections that we’re seeing in places like New York, if you were symptomatic at one point but were not tested, and you were in close contact with somebody, I think you should tell them.Buchholz: There’s not been any evidence that anyone’s gotten it more than once. Someone with a normal immune system that can react to the virus and get better should have immunity for quite some time, at least a year, if not lifelong.There have been reports out of China suggesting people are testing positive for Covid-19 a second time. Most scientists think it is an issue around the inaccuracy of the testing and not that people are having two separate cases of the disease.Dr David Buchholz, senior founding medical director, primary care, assistant professor of pediatrics, Columbia University Irving medical centerDr William Hillmann, associate inpatient physician director at Massachusetts general hospital"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fac75bb928c6e1abc17bcc59e61b11210d531a22/0_74_5168_3103/master/5168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e64ccd9e759f2dca46f41dc28b1d39e7","title":"photographing povertys pandemic its a different beast in south africa","story":"In the first of a series focusing on the work of photographers during the coronavirus crisis, Jerome Delay trains his lens on South AfricaWe’ve become used to the images of western cities around quarantine. In the empty streets of industrial and post-industrial societies tightly connected by globalisation, absence has become one of the most powerful metaphors of the coronavirus.It’s a very different story in countries where inequality and poverty are much more acute where access to a safe and distanced space in which to isolate is limited by poverty, social status and economics, and intimate social connections have a different importance.As part of a series on photographing coronavirus in these places, we have spoken to photographers or asked them to submit their impressions of the images they’re capturing, and the challenges that they face in documenting the pandemic among the world’s impoverished.Jerome Delay, who is based in South Africa for the Associated Press, is a veteran of covering war, social conflicts and outbreaks of disease. Many of his images on the coronavirus outbreak have drilled down into how the disease, and the social disruption it has provoked, has been experienced by some of the country’s poorest citizens.Among Delay’s striking images are several depicting a roundup of homeless and sometimes drug-addicted South Africans, including a group rounded up and taken to the Caledonian sports stadium in Pretoria to be housed in tents.But if documenting outbreaks of disease – including Ebola virus – is familiar to him, more jolting has been the experience of covering a serious epidemic in the place he calls home.“One thing that helps,” he told the  by phone while waiting for permission to photograph inside a hospital, “is that I have three tours of duty doing Ebola.“The social distancing, the handwashing and keeping healthy, none of that’s new. The difference is that this is happening in my own town – to people around me, and to people who I know. So there’s no escaping from it.”In South Africa, like other places, the disease first appears to have arrived in force via those more connected to the international hubs of finance, business and globalisation.“One of the hotspots has been the financial centre, people who had travelled to Hong Kong and Singapore, places like that, and who had come back and gone to parties.”And if, as he notes, life has not changed much in well-to-do places like the suburbs of northern Johannesburg, where “people live indoors behind high walls”, that is not the case for those living in crowded poorer neighbourhoods or on the streets.“In the townships, even up to a few days ago, people would see me, a westerner, and shout: ‘Corona! Corona!’ because they thought it was a disease of rich white people. Now people ask if I know how they can get tested. It’s beginning to sink in.”While South Africa has been quick to introduce tough movement and isolation restrictions to control the spread of the disease, the prism through which that is viewed, in a country with a strong memory of the apartheid era, has been very different.“Some people are being forcibly removed home, to open spaces. Even if it is an informal shack it brings back some bad memories – that, and the police telling people to get indoors.”He describes photographing homeless people rounded up at the Caledonian stadium earlier in the month, at the beginning of the country’s lockdown.“All these homeless people, mainly drug addicts on heroin or whatever they can get their hands on, they were rounded up on the street in Pretoria and taken to the stadium, where there was nothing but a few tents to accommodate them.Among the more striking images from the stadium is Delay’s picture of Henry, who he found sitting in a rubbish bin.“I saw this guy in a trash can. You know, it’s starting to get cold here. When I first noticed him, he was sitting on it. Then his legs went inside. He was protecting himself.”Inevitably, perhaps, the conversation turns to a comparison with his three stints photographing Ebola, and his own personal safety concerns.“With Ebola you have a lot less chances of catching it. Unless you fall head first into a bucket of vomit next to the bed of someone who is dying, the odds of catching it are slim – but the chances of dying if you do are very high. With coronavirus the odds of catching it are very high, and the odds of surviving high.Delay catches himself. “But I’m in a bad age group. I’m 60 in a couple of weeks. I’ve had a heart attack. Basically, I’m in trouble if I catch this thing! So I socially distance from people, I maintain hygiene and I look after my health.”So what precautions has he been taking? “I wear a mask. The only problem is that there’s a shortage of masks and it’s been difficult bringing masks into the country.“So we’ve been looking at ways to reuse the better quality ones we have. The one I’m wearing now, I’ll put it in the oven for 30 minutes and then I’ll hang it up for 72 hours. I wash my hands every five minutes and try to keep my distance.”One issue for the photographers is navigating the warning not to touch one’s face in a profession that involves repeatedly holding a camera up to the face.Delay says he cleans his cameras constantly. “I’ve got gallons of sanitiser I ordered online when the virus first popped up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca47872100e5f7da03447d1b1c6c03fc269e6af6/0_72_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d4c2da1b854202a1a905b809198da89","title":"second wave of locusts in east africa said to be 20 times worse","story":"UN warns of ‘alarming and unprecedented threat’ to food security and livelihoods in the regionA second wave of desert locusts is threatening east Africa with estimates that it will be 20 times worse then the plague that descended two months ago.The locusts present “an extremely alarming and unprecedented threat” to food security and livelihoods, according to the UN. A swarm of just more than a third of a square mile can eat the same amount of food in one day as 35,000 people.This second invasion from breeding grounds in Somalia includes more young adults which are especially voracious eaters.In its latest locust watch update, the UN said the situation was “extremely alarming” as an increasing number of new swarms form in north and central Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia.Uganda reported two swarms arriving last week from neighbouring Kenya, further destabilising food security and the livelihoods of people in the east and north of the country. The insects follow spring rains, seeking emerging crops and other vegetation.Hellen Adoa, a minister at Uganda’s agriculture department, said: “This is very active, destructive and we are worried it has come at the time of lockdown. We are a bit overwhelmed.“The moment they arrive in a place the first thing they do is to eat anything green. They have destroyed some fields of crops and vegetation,” she said.Kenyan officials have said coronavirus crackdowns have slowed  efforts to fight the infestation, as crossing borders has become harder and pesticide deliveries are held up. Aerial spraying is the only effective means of controlling locusts but there have been complaints that the pesticides are affecting livestock.In February, eight east African countries experienced the worst outbreak in 70 years, exacerbated by climate change and war in Yemen.The insects can travel about 90 miles a day and eat their own body weight in crops.“Heavy rains in late March established favourable breeding conditions for yet another generation of locusts in the Horn of Africa. These will emerge as young swarms in June, just as many farmers start to harvest,” said Antonio Querido of the UN’s food and agriculture agency in Uganda.“By now, most farmers have planted the first season annual crops. If the locust swarms persist and control operations are not effectively undertaken the food crops will be lost and agriculture-based livelihoods will be impacted upon.“Immature swarms are the most voracious stage of locust development. They are aggressive feeders and as such can cause a lot of damage to crops and forage.”Christine Apolot, the chairperson for Uganda’s Kumi district, which was hit by a swarm last week, said people were filled with despair, having already endured flooding and the previous swarm: “This is seriously going to bring food insecurity. It’s the fear we have at hand right now.“As we were hopeful of to receive some relief food to support the situation on ground, the locust invaded and Covid-19 lockdown is moving towards devastating the economy.“We expect government, number of partners and World Food Programme to come to our rescue with relief food. Otherwise our people will end with starvation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f71d41678085def4b6d9f13fe6cfb3f7525fd5/109_207_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b01a4f71b8c16a880e8db01d647ea0ca","title":"how we met within hours i knew i would marry her","story":"Santiago and Gisela Klein, 55 and 48, met on a beach in Uruguay in 1994. Originally from Argentina, they now live in HertfordshireIn January 1994, Santiago Klein was taking a break from city life with a beach holiday in Uruguay. “It was a popular place for people living in Argentina to visit. I started talking to Gisela’s sister because she knows my sister,” he recalls. It wasn’t long before the pair were introduced, and he asked if she wanted to go on a date later that day. “I noticed her eyes at first, and I really liked her.” They arranged to go out at midnight. “In Latin America, we go out late and stay out until 5am,” says Santiago. “I went out for dinner with my family first and they asked about my date but I couldn’t remember her name. I just knew there was something about her I really liked.”Keen to impress his date, he admits he was showing off at the start. “At first, I thought he was a bit full of himself, but I soon realised he was really down to earth and lovely,” says Gisela. “I went home and told my mum and auntie that I’d found the man I was going to marry.”Santiago felt the same way. “We had lots in common and wanted the same things in life. In the space of a couple of hours I knew I would marry her.” Though they were both coming out of long-term relationships, something felt right between them. “I had never thought about marriage before and suddenly I just knew,” says Santiago.A few days later, he returned to Buenos Aires for work, while Gisela continued her holiday. “He came back to Uruguay a week later and he proposed,” she says. “We went to a market seller there and he bought the rings.”Gisela was also living in Buenos Aires at the time, and the pair returned to the city together after their travels were over. “I joke that she comes from the posh bit of the city, like Chelsea in London,” says Santiago. “And I am from the equivalent of Hendon.” The couple arranged their wedding for 6 November 1994, exactly 10 months after they met. “We wanted it to be the same day of the month,” he says.Before the wedding, the couple had to tell their parents about their plans. “We went for dinner with my family and we just kept on ordering more food,” says Gisella. “He was so nervous about telling them.” Eventually Santiago plucked up courage. “My father-in-law looked at me, finished drinking his coffee and then said: ‘I knew you would marry her I just thought you’d wait a bit longer.’ They’d only known me for about 15 minutes.”Since they married, the couple have had three children, Freddie, Maggie and Max. They have lived in both the UK and the US, moving around for Santiago’s work in property development while Gisela cared for the children. The first move came in 2001, during a period of riots and instability in Argentina. “Things weren’t good at home, so when Santiago suggested the move I thought ‘Why not?’,” says Gisela. She admits life in the UK was hard at first as she spoke no English and had young children. “Over 10 years, I learned to really love it.”In 2010, the family moved to Florida. “We knew it wasn’t going to be for us long-term,” Santiago says. “We said we needed to move back home but neither of us knew whether that meant Argentina or the UK.”They moved to England again in 2016. As well as having plenty of friends in the UK, Gisela says they love the “fairness” of British society. “It feels like a caring place to live.” But they visit their family in Argentina as often as they can – and at Christmas and New Year they return to the beach in Uruguay where they met.Santiago says their marriage has always felt right. “She complements me so well. And I have always loved the way she smiles with her eyes and not just her mouth.” Gisela has always known that she and her husband were meant to be. “He has lots of regrets in life, but he always says he has never regretted marrying me, not once.”• Want to share your story?

Then I found a bottle of her scent Over the past 27 years, my mum has been by my side through thick and thin. She is my best friend, my inspiration and my rock.I live with my husband, but my pre-Covid-19 days were regularly filled with quality mother-daughter time. We would travel to work together, grab a bite to eat in between meetings, and every Tuesday night, we’d go ice skating together at Alexandra Palace, in north London, sharing a passion she passed down to me. But most importantly, my mum has accompanied me on my anxiety journey.For the past eight years, I’ve suffered with general anxiety disorder, which although controllable with certain techniques, has meant panic attacks, irrational fears and a lot of crying in my mum’s arms. But knowing that she has been present through my challenges and self-help discoveries has always filled me with calm.When lockdown started, my heart sank: I knew I wouldn’t be able to see her. Suddenly, instead of our uplifting face-to-face conversations, I found myself offloading my coronavirus anxiety, intense claustrophobia and sleep deprivation on to her via FaceTime.Last week, having significantly more time on my hands than usual, I decided to sort out my perfume cupboard, reordering my bottles into fragrance families – the florals I would one day wear to summer events, the aquatic beach scents I would sport on future holidays and, last, my everyday picks. I enjoyed spraying these and escaping lockdown life, if only for a few hours.Despite being a fragrance fanatic, I have not been spritzing my signature scents much during lockdown. Maybe because I’ve not felt myself lately or perhaps it’s just not felt appropriate to spray perfume each morning: it feels like the equivalent of wearing a full face of makeup to a sombre event.As I scanned the fragrances I once obsessed over, I felt empty and disoriented. Then, reaching for the back of the cupboard, I picked out a bottle I had never opened.It was my mother’s perfume, L’Occitane Néroli \u0026amp Orchidée Eau de Toilette, in its elegant bottle complete with a pink bow. I remembered she had picked it up for me and shamefully I had never used it.Sitting on the floor and spraying it on to my wrist, I immediately felt my mother’s presence. Memories came flooding back of baking cookies in the kitchen, walks in flower gardens and ice-skating together on a lake in Austria.It’s known that fragrance has a unique ability to uplift and encourage happiness as our brain associates certain smells with positive associations and emotions, but I was stunned to feel the warmth and comfort of my mum’s embrace after just one spritz.Since then, I have been wearing her fragrance every day, topping up every few hours and inhaling deeply. In lockdown, fragrance has become less of a luxury product and more of a therapeutic go-to that feeds my soul. It’s an invisible connection to her in a bottle.Not only has this new perfume routine worked for me, but it’s also put me in a more positive space to start and finish the day. Wearing my mother’s perfume has brought me closer to her than ever before and given me a glimpse of hope.

Some people thought I was singing, “On the dole, all day”’Before Harry’s Game aired over three nights, we went to a private press showing in London to around 100 people. At the end of the first hour-long episode, the house lights came up, the song played and nobody reacted. I thought, “That’s that.” After the second hour, there were less people talking over the music. The third episode was devastating. Both main characters died. Then the music came on. Not one person stood up, and the music just played out. That’s when we knew the song had touched a nerve.I didn’t think I had much of a voice. I would have loved to have been a rock’n’roller, but gradually I realised that I had a different timbre and an ethereal feel, which is very much part of the Clannad sound. Whenever people ask where that sound comes from I say, “Go to Donegal. You’ll feel the earthiness and the atmosphere.”The Irish Gaelic lyrics for Theme from Harry’s Game derived from a saying in a book of old Irish proverbs that our grandfather had given Ciarán: “Everything that is and will be, will cease to be. The moon and the stars, youth and beauty.” There’s no solution to war, just people killing each other. We were never a political band, but the sentiment that all things must pass inspired the lyrics.The chorus, “Fol lol the doh, fol the day, fol the doh fol the day,” comes from ancient Irish “mouth-music”. It was common in the reels and jigs world, but Ciarán thought it would be good to slow it down. Some people thought I was singing, “On the dole, all day.” Yorkshire TV sent over an engineer, Richard Dodd, who’d worked on 10cc’s I’m Not in Love and introduced us to the idea of layering the vocals. Ciarán and I sang looking right at each other. We could feel the emotion of the song. I think we used the second take, and layered it on top of that.There were only three TV channels back then, so we knew people would watch Harry’s Game. Noel Edmonds played the song on Radio 1 for the first time and then after the next song he said: “We’ve been inundated with people asking, ‘What was that?’” So he played it again. Bono said that when he first heard it in a car, he had to pull over. Then because of the Troubles it was taken off the radio for a day in case it was offensive, so we sent them the translation and they played it again.One day, we were in a Transit van in Germany the next we were being picked up in a limo to do Top of the Pops and taking pictures of ourselves jumping in and out. It was unreal for a small Irish folk band from Donegal. I was the first female Irish folk singer to break abroad. People started calling me the First Lady of Celtic Music, a title I’m really proud of."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b812e820104965546fc2a4f65f7cb9753872c3b2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68102d189a7e88cbbeb8edf9e26cce4d","title":"opera and classical concerts to watch at home critics picks week four","story":"Overwhelmed by content to stream? Our critics pick a daily highlight from the treasure trove of classical music currently available. Today, music to see you through from 13 to 17 April• Week three picks: A charismatic Don Giovanni and ear-bending new sounds from Australia• Week two: Argerich, Aida and Hans Abrahamsen• Week one: Igor Levit, Il Trovatore and the Berlin PhilOtto Klemperer made his final public appearance at the Royal Festival Hall in London in 1971, but the previous year he had conducted a Beethoven symphony cycle there with the New Philharmonia (as it was then called), that concluded with two performances of the Ninth Symphony. It’s a BBC recording of one of those, on 30 June that year, with the New Philharmonia Chorus and Teresa Żylis-Gara, Janet Baker, George Shirley and Theo Adam as the soloists, which is now being streamed on the Philharmonia’s website. These days Klemperer’s performances, especially from the tail-end of his career, tend to be characterised as thick-textured and predominantly slow, but this account of the Ninth at least partly belies that. His approach is, of course, thoroughly traditional, with larger forces than we’re used to hearing in this work nowadays – Klemperer doubled up the woodwind parts, as Beethoven apparently specified for the work’s premiere. And by today’s standards too, the tempi are certainly on the slow side. But there isn’t a moment when the performance seems to drag, while the textures often seem miraculously light – the scherzo positively dances. If the first movement is relatively routine it’s a performance of gradually increasing power, and by the finale Klemperer’s seemingly minimal gestures to the orchestra have conjured up something truly remarkable. Andrew Clements“Innocence, you have corrupted me,” the Governess sings at a climactic moment in Britten’s adaptation of Henry James’s insidious ghost story. In Alessandro Talevi’s Opera North staging, the boundaries between innocence and corruption constantly blur, throwing us continuously off balance, and few other productions have quite so consistently, or indeed so disturbingly, maintained the fundamental ambiguity as to whether the ghosts are genuine supernatural entities, or projections of the Governess’s disordered mind. There are some splendidly sinister moments, as shadows behave independently of bodies, and the children become increasingly like the ghosts that may or may not possess them. And the final moments of Act I are genuinely marrow-freezing. Tensely conducted by Leo McFall, it’s exceptionally well sung across the board. Sarah Tynan is outstanding as the tormented Governess, while Tim Gasiorek’s tragic, chilling Miles is probably the best you will ever see. Tim AshleyPolitics, affairs of the heart, betrayal: these are Verdi’s essentials in a plot based on the 1792 assassination of King Gustav III of Sweden. It was politicking, too, that dictated the opera being set in different locations in slightly differing versions (confusion alert). In his debut production for New York’s politan Opera, director David Alden opted for the Swedish setting, but with contemporary Scandi noir. Against the suitably stark and sleek design, references to paintings of the Fall of Icarus, Busby Berkeley films, fishermen in macs and sou’westers straight off a Peter Grimes set, not to mention the contents of soothsayer Ulrika’s shiny patent handbag, add notes of whimsy. The late lamented Dmitri Hvorostovsky is a main attraction, expressing both the violent urge of vengeance as well as the tenderness of regret, with the famous aria Eri Tu a great outpouring of emotion. Rian EvansOpera Forward, Dutch National Opera’s annual festival of music theatre, should have launched last month with the world premiere of Ritratto by Willem Jeths, who was the Netherlands’s first “national composer” between 2014 and 2016. This year’s event was cancelled only days before the opening, but Ritratto’s dress rehearsal had been filmed and is now available online. The portrait of the title is that of Luisa Casati, an Italian heiress who was the muse and model for a number of artists in the early decades of the 20th century. Jeths’s opera depicts the efforts of Casati (sung by Verity Wingate) to become part of that artistic world, at a time when fascism was already beginning to take hold in Italy – Sergei Diaghilev, Man Ray, Jacob Epstein and Gabriele D’Annunzio all feature in the cast list. Jeths’s score is mainstream conservative, his vocal writing largely declamatory, but it’s a concise, dramatically taut piece, stylishly staged by Marcel Sijm.

Further work by experts suggested the body was accelerated by the loss of water vapour and other gases – as seen with comets but not asteroids. The upshot was that ‘Oumuamua was labelled a “comet in disguise”.Now scientists say they have shed light on the mystery and addressed the myriad pieces of the ‘Oumuamua puzzle.They say ‘Oumuamua is an “active asteroid” formed from a body that was torn apart by its parent star and then ejected into interstellar space.“Most planetary bodies … consist of numerous pieces of rock that have coalesced under the influence of gravity. You could imagine them as sandcastles floating in space,” said Dr Yun Zhang, a co-author of the new study from the Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur in France.These bodies experience a number of forces as they pass their star.“A tidal encounter between a planet or small body and a star is a tug-of-war game between the gravitational pull of the star and the self-gravity of the flyby body,” said Zhang, noting that when the body passes too close to the star and enters the tidal disruption region, it can stretch and be torn apart giving rise to fragments.Writing in the journal Nature Astronomy, Zhang and Prof Doug Lin of the University of California’s Lick Observatory, report how they used computer models to reveal that such a process could have produced ‘Oumuamua and explain features including its tumbling motion, colour and unusual shape.Zhang said near and far parts of ‘Oumuamua’s parent body would have been pulled apart from each other in the tidal disruption region, resulting in the formation of elongated fragments, such as ‘Oumuamua, which would be glued together by surface material that melted near the star and froze as it flew on.Zhang said most of the volatile substances on ‘Oumuamua’s surface would have been lost from heating by the star around which it formed, but some residual water ice could have been preserved below its surface and subsequently heated by our, hotter, sun – explaining its unusual acceleration. “We may call ‘Oumuamua an active asteroid,” said Zhang.The team say ‘Oumuamua could have formed from either a comet or a planet several times the size of Earth, but the former better explains ‘Oumuamua’s apparent subsurface water ice. The star around which ‘Oumuamua formed, they add, would probably have been similar to our sun but smaller and denser – or possibly a white dwarf.Zhang says the findings not only scotch again the much-publicised notion that ‘Oumuamua is an alien spacecraft, but offer an efficient way in which asteroidal interstellar objects, previously thought to be rare, can be formed.What’s more, she says, with objects such as ‘Oumuamua passing through “habitable zones”, such as our own solar system, they may even carry seeds of life.Dr Alan Jackson, of Arizona State University, who was not involved in the study but has previously carried out research into ‘Oumuamua, welcomed the work.“The idea of ‘Oumuamua being a fragment of a larger body that was tidally disrupted by passing close to its parent star was suggested by Matija Ćuk in 2018,” he said. “But this is the first work that I have seen that really explores that idea in detail and shows that it might explain how ‘Oumuamua was produced and a lot of its unusual features.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d35dd6aced5bb8c6854f563c192322dd9195b89f/0_297_6267_3760/master/6267.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b0839655cc56b6cfba8434f516aa23d","title":"my working week mother arrives refuge covid 19 symptoms","story":"We are getting full very quickly but it’s important that women who have survived domestic abuse know we can support themMy first task is to review staffing levels and check in with everyone across the different refuges. Some staff are now working remotely or self-isolating but so far, so good. Those of us travelling into the offices are worried. No one wants to take this virus home to families, and whatever precautions we put in place there is still that thought in the back of our minds.I check the post and see something that looks like a National Insurance number for a resident. She has been waiting several weeks and without it her first benefit payment won’t be released. I let the woman know – she is relieved.I sign a food bank voucher for a family who arrived a week ago (thankfully they are still operating). Then we have our daily virtual check-in as a team. We talk about how difficult everyone is finding social distancing, especially with the toddlers who just want to run up and hug you.It’s exhausting work at the best of times, but now even more so for those people who are physically in the refuge. Those off site feel guilty about not being there they see how hard it is and really want to help, but their health has to come first. We talk through these feelings at our virtual staff meetings.A colleague from a nearby refuge belonging to the charity I work for tells me a family has arrived with symptoms of coronavirus. The mother didn’t know if they would be accepted, but she was so pleased to be offered a self-contained unit for herself and her children to recover in away from other families. A resident’s mental health has declined significantly since the lockdown. Without college, volunteering and face-to-face counselling, she is struggling. We are concerned she is getting caught up in the past and the emotions that go with the abuse she survived. I get in touch with our local housing team to find out what their plans are. They confirm they are operating remotely using telephone interviews, and that viewings and temporary accommodation allocations will go ahead with appropriate precautions. I dial into a meeting hosted by the local authority. Everyone is relieved to hear that refuges are still running, taking referrals and bringing in families in need.A resident asks about an email she has received from her solicitor she has been granted her leave to remain, but she can’t pick up her new biometric card until the solicitor’s office is open again.A five-year-old comes into the office to make a call to a staff member who is shielding. I hear him say “I miss you so much, have you gone forever?”. We get a big delivery of craft resources to share between all the families in the service. The children and family worker was going to come in to sort them out but she has developed a cough so needs to self-isolate. The children are getting increasingly restless so I start iding out resources into bags while taking other calls.In the staff catch-up we talk about referrals and how many more women we are seeing. We all think this will increase in the weeks to come. As not all move-on options are available for women, we are getting full quickly.I install a wifi booster. The teenager downstairs is very relieved she has been struggling to upload her homework and as she is self-isolating she can’t use the desk in the main lounge anymore. I talk one mum through how to use the food voucher she has just received as part of the free school meals. English is not her first language and I have to stay a safe distance but we get there in the end.My colleague tells me the family with coronavirus are starting to recover. It’s heartening to hear how all of the other women came together to make the family meals and left them at their door. The department for work and pensions calls to update me on how they are changing their processes to deal with the 1m extra claims, and what the escalation process will be for agencies working with vulnerable people, including domestic violence survivors, to ensure they can access their benefits.I’m emotionally drained but feel really proud of my staff and the residents. My final job before I head home is to check all the families have enough cleaning supplies for the weekend.The author of this piece is a domestic abuse service manager for Hestia, a charity supporting adults and children in crisis.

Cavendish hoped to compete in the Madison in Japan and win the Olympic gold medal that has eluded him but he was not selected by British Cycling.In a report by cyclingnews, Cavendish was quoted as saying: “It’s hard for me to go. British Cycling have been … they realised now they don’t want to be in the position where they have to not take me. They said to me: ‘You haven’t done any World Cups’. When have I had to do World Cups?”Wiggins replied: “That’s the thing that’s lacking now in British Cycling: someone who actually knows what they’re talking about. It’s all about box ticking. With you it was just a case of opening a few doors so you could get qualified, knowing you would deliver on the day, which you do and always did – three world titles, Olympic medal and all that.“That’s sort of been taken away now. They’d rather someone qualified for all the World Cups, then finished 10th in the Olympics. I think it’s shit, to be honest, but hey, cycling has changed so much.” The pair went on to discuss how British Cycling had asked for the return of equipment – bikes and skinsuits – with which they competed at previous Olympics. Wiggins said of his bike from the 2012 time trial: “They didn’t have a choice with me.

Show it off to people and say ‘copy this’?” Wiggins added: “I’ve still got my skinsuit as well. They’re not having it. Fuck off. Try and get it from me. They try and take it back and it’s like, well, we did it, we grafted … These are my memories.”The pair have broadcast regular informal chats on Instagram in recent months, discussing their careers, the wider sport and taking questions from fans and fellow cyclists.Wiggins and Team Sky (now Team Ineos) have been embroiled in controversy since the Fancy Bears leaks in 2016 relating to therapeutic use exemptions during his career.

It’s a haunting sound and it’s almost as if you’re in a war,” Ian McKinley says as he begins to explain the impact of the lockdown in Italy which began on 9 March and will now continue for at least another three weeks. McKinley, the Irish rugby player who lost the sight in his left eye when he was raked at the bottom of a ruck in Dublin in 2010, understands adversity.The 30-year-old also understands better than most how you come back from uncertain times. Having been forced into retirement he took a chance in 2012 and accepted an offer to do some informal coaching in a small Italian city, Udine, near the Slovenian border. Neither he nor his girlfriend, Cordelia, who is now his wife, could speak any Italian but they adapted. Then, with the help of his brother, McKinley decided to try to play rugby again while wearing specially designed goggles which could protect his eyes. Slowly, but with inspirational determination, McKinley came back to professional rugby – with such impact that he has played nine Tests for Italy at fly-half.McKinley and his wife now live in Treviso, in northern Italy, close to the area that has been hit so severely by Covid-19. He is engaging and intelligent – and also a compelling witness to the Italian lockdown. Britain and Ireland are weeks behind Italy, both in terms of facing the worst of the pandemic, and also in coping with such stringent self‑isolation. Hearing his calm voice from Treviso, and seeing his wry and wistful expressions on my laptop screen, McKinley is like a guide from the future. Amid the ghostly life he has lived the past six weeks, and the continuing worry, he has found hope and light.“We’ve been in a lockdown for over a month now and thankfully the silence and the sirens have subsided somewhat. It’s become a bit better the past few days. The numbers are going down a little. But it still feels very surreal to have gone from living your life to the fullest, being involved with lots of things, to basically zero. You can only walk around if you have a pet to exercise and so we’re lucky we have a little dog. We’re allowed out once a day to walk the dog and there’s no one around. This little city I live in is not like Dublin or London – but 70,000 people still live here. And it’s completely dead.The curbing of freedom is working, slowly, even if the death rate is still distressing. “It’s well over 19,000 now,” McKinley says, “but the rate of deaths per day is going down. The rate of infection is going down. That’s all you can do – try and find something positive in this mad pandemic. Time will tell which measures have been most effective. It seems as if the UK started out doing things differently and now the lockdown is maybe not being followed as closely as in Italy.”Britain has now passed the highest daily death rate suffered in both Italy and Spain. “The measures that have been taken by the Italian government have been heavily criticised by a lot of people,” McKinley says, “but they’ve worked pretty well. I think they’ve acted in the best way they could have.”It’s also helped that, from the outset, virtually all Italians have adhered to the rigorous lockdown while avoiding the kind of panic buying that accompanied the UK’s initial response. “A huge amount of credit has to go to the Italian people because there’s been no panic buying. We’ve not had any toilet paper wars here. Certain things like flour and eggs are a bit lower than normal. But it’s never got to a stage where people are fighting over things. When people are backed into a corner, and there’s a lot of adversity, you definitely get a sense of community spirit in Italy, of making sure that each person is OK. People are pulling together and wanting to keep each other strong to try and get through this.”His own situation feels more precarious because, as McKinley admits, “I haven’t played many games this year. The difference with Italian clubs in relation to British and Irish rugby is that there are no second teams. We’re a squad of 52 and only 23 people go out on to a rugby field to play. It’s been a bit up and down for me this year.“So, yeah, this virus has thrown a ner in the works. I have a contract this year with Benetton – but we can’t say what will happen next season because people can’t commit to anything. When you’re cooped up in a house for months you can definitely think of the worst-case scenario. Or you can look at it as a good break for your body and time to reflect on what’s really important. In terms of pay cuts I’m sure players will not begrudge that because this is just such a huge issue.”McKinley has obviously come through testing times before. “My life was turned upside down in 2010 with the eye injury. And then, ultimately, when I made the decision in 2011 to retire. I moved to Udine when I was 22 and not knowing the language is tricky. You certainly learn a lot about yourself. You basically sink or swim in those situations. I adapted so I’m forever grateful I made the decision to come over. I’ve made friends for life. Thankfully from the work side of things it’s worked out really well. I’m also very fortunate to have two homes because my family are back in Ireland. But my wife and I have created a home in Italy.”He laughs when saying that he often dreams in Italian now. But McKinley pauses when I ask if Italy has changed him as a person. “That’s a very good question. I think it has. Absolutely. People have said to me: ‘You were on course for this great career in Ireland,’ and I was dealt that hand. Other people are dealt their hand and they have to get through whatever problems they’ve faced. For me, it’s opened up the world. So for example, working with the Laureus organisation in so many different areas of Italy has made me see how they use sport against violence, discrimination and disadvantage around the world. Now we’re at a standstill Laureus is working closely with 200 sports and their development programmes globally to ensure they get support during the pandemic.“So, going back to your question about change through adversity, I would not be speaking Italian if I was still living in Ireland. I would not have been exposed to everything that has been so positive for me in Italy. I certainly appreciate things a lot more. I want to win rugby games and trophies, of course, but when you step back and think about what’s important in life, you get a real perspective. I still want to perform at the highest level but so much else matters more.”Thousands of young rugby players around the world wear the goggles that McKinley helped pioneer – and he is contacted regularly by partially sighted people who still want to succeed in sport. “I get messages weekly from people who have had similar injuries or problems to mine. That’s incredible. And knowing that 2,000 people around the world are using rugby goggles is wonderful. The idea of the goggles were in the pipeline but my brother Phillip put me in touch with Johnny Merrigan, an Irish design student, who is a very important part of this story. Myself, Phillip and Johnny got together and basically pushed the product over the line. The manufacturing company obviously take the plaudits because they’ve produced the goggles.”McKinley would like to move into coaching once his playing career ends. “Even when I stopped playing the first time I wanted to become a coach. I still have that passion. I really enjoy seeing players grow and develop because rugby is a wonderful sport for inclusion. I’ve had two years of coaching experience, from when I first came to Italy, and I loved it.”In the meantime, like the rest of us, McKinley has to wait and hope that he and his family and all those he cares about survive the coronavirus crisis. “It’s difficult,” he agrees. “You go through good days and bad days. For us, it’s a very small sacrifice to sit in our nice apartments, with modern technology, and wait it out. There are people out there on the front line, fighting it every day. So we just need to stay home and follow the guidelines.”When I suggest that even the first time he gets tackled hard on the training field will feel good, McKinley grins. “Depends who it’s from. But the little things in life that you take for granted are going to seem sweet. To walk down to a coffee shop, and just talk to the people you know, your friends and rugby mates, will feel very special. But everybody is in the same boat. It helps to know that the vast majority of the human population is in this together.”Ian McKinley and Laureus encourage everyone to stay home, stay safe and stay healthy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9963d6823b836d3901d9d62fd2a318e7f6570a8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3cc0102bfa19d04477d758771a4b26aa","title":"sir stirling moss motor racing legends life in pictures","story":"Stirling Moss, arguably the greatest driver never to have won the F1 drivers’ championship, has died.

No one should attack or damage or do anything like that but it’s very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative.”He added: “That’s all I would say, as someone with an inquiring mind.”Holmes made the remarks after scientists dismissed any link between 5G and coronavirus, with the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, previously calling a conspiracy theory, spread via YouTube, that linked the two “dangerous nonsense”.Viewers criticised the presenter’s comments on social media and accused him of legitimising baseless theories. One, vickster51, wrote: “So I’ve just heard This Morning presenter Eamonn Holmes legitimise the stories linking the coronavirus lockdown to 5G. On national television. Wow. How irresponsible can you get. Switching off. Hope Holly and Phil are back soon.”Andy Green said: “Well done Eamonn. You just added more fuel to this 5G conspiracy theory by legitimising what is utter nonsense. You need to research properly before pronouncing.”MPs have called for social media companies to be held to account following reports of phone masts being attacked after the claim spread online.At least 20 phone masts across the UK are believed to have been set alight or vandalised since the start of the pandemic in connection to false 5G claims, according to government and industry sources, who said this month they were increasingly concerned about the impact of the baseless theories.Facebook has since stepped up efforts to stop far-right groups from promoting conspiracy theories linking coronavirus to 5G.Ofcom is assessing comments made by the conspiracist David Icke during an interview broadcast by the local television station London Live, in which he suggested that the coronavirus pandemic was part of a plot by governments to destroy the economy and conduct mass surveillance.The media watchdog previously ruled that a local radio station had breached its rules after one of its guests suggested the Covid-19 outbreak was caused by the rollout of 5G mobile technology.A government spokesman said: “We are aware of a number of attacks on phone masts and abuse of telecoms engineers apparently inspired by crackpot conspiracy theories circulating online. Those responsible for these criminal acts will face the full force of the law.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de23c9d8151bd8d9c5493d9d92d5cc7f1ccefcc7/0_8_2536_1522/master/2536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5fb0187ebb1880a9d6989a8d14f229a","title":"the early days of home computing in pictures","story":"“There were no design conventions for the earliest home computers, no rules for how they’d look,” says Alex Wiltshire, author of Home Computers, a new book that explores the rapidly changing face of the household machine between its birth in the 1970s and the 1990s.

Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

After another brutal, gale-pummelled winter, the little island is waking up. The machair, the great grass carpet that covers almost everything, has cowslips, primroses and wild hyacinths pushing up at the spring sun. But I can’t go. Caledonian MacBrayne won’t let outsiders on the ferry. My friend, self-isolating in her family’s croft, suggests a Facebook site that has video of an afternoon at a favourite beach: “Lie in your garden, close your eyes, listen to the sea and pretend.”As you approach it, the island hardly seems to be there at all. “The land beneath the waves” is just one of the old names for Tiree, a 10-mile scrap of dune, rock and grass to the west of Mull on the far edge of the Inner Hebrides. It does seem not much more than a wisp, a dream of an island, a piece of flotsam in the vastness of the Atlantic. There is nothing west of it until Newfoundland, 2,000 miles away. But when the ferry shoulders alongside Gott Bay pier, the place is real enough, though constructed mainly of fly-away things - fine sand, grass, wildflowers. Its most solid features are the sheep and the 600-odd hardy, friendly souls who live there, and the wind.I’ve been visiting all my life. All our childhood holidays were spent there, except for one disastrous caravanning trip round mid-Wales. Before the first world war, my grandmother, whose aunt lived there, played on the beaches and in the same rockpools where my children do. Maybe one day I’ll help my grandchildren make sand volcanoes, dig for cockles and start out on the surf at Balevuilin Bay. My children have got the bug - ask them where, anywhere in the world, they’d like to go for summer holidays and their answer is guaranteed.What is it to us, and the other people who love the place, visitors and islanders? Tiree is not like anywhere else, not even any other Hebridean island: that’s clear enough. In June it has more sun than almost anywhere in the UK, for a start. It is an escape, of course, a sanctuary place where a life expands, where your eyes rediscover the long distance, your nose the smells of a simpler world: salt-flavoured rain, warm clover, kelp drying on the beach, sun on a tarred roof, fresh mackerel frying in a buttered pan. We are city people pretending to be Highland crofters: your holiday is just a reality TV show, a friend laughed at us. Yes, not unfair: that’s how lucky we are.For all my life, Tiree has been most important when I haven’t been there. Working, worrying, in exhaustion or despair, it’s the place I go to in my mind for ease and peace, with the backstop of knowing that if things get tough, I can just get to Oban and jump on the ferry. Now, for the first time ever, I can’t. An Tirisdeach, the island’s fortnightly news-sheet arrives through my city letterbox with news that the Baptist chapel at Baugh has become an isolation ward - should need arise - and a charming editorial that begs Tiree’s friends and visitors to stay away. We mustn’t even go to help with the lambing. The editor promises the island will welcome us back, when the right time comes.• Alex Renton’s latest book is Stiff Upper Lip: Secrets, Crimes and the Schooling of a Ruling Class"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d10547066982f09d2cdc0f3ecde1565c23821c1/0_101_3832_2300/master/3832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=929ea80f0b058cf4adb3f6d3f0b5bc37","title":"lonely planet closes its melbourne and london offices where now for travel","story":"As the travel publisher closes its Melbourne and London offices, a former guidebook writer asks what’s next for an industry in crisis Covid-19 has changed everything. In particular, it has changed everything about travel. As a Lonely Planet writer you learn fast that change is the only constant on the road. Still, no one was expecting the changes announced last week: that Lonely Planet is to close its Melbourne production facility and London offices “almost entirely”, as well as its magazine and Trade and Reference ision. However, the famous guidebooks will continue to be published, though they are temporarily on hold.Certainly, the closure of Lonely Planet’s original headquarters in Melbourne is the end of an era. It was in Melbourne that co-founders Tony and Maureen Wheeler set up shop in 1973 after finishing their epic overland journey from London across Asia to Australia. They published an account of the journey in Across Asia on the Cheap, a stapled together volume featuring hand-drawn maps and the nowfamous logo, designed by Tony. It sold 1,500 copies. Encouraged by its success, the Wheelers followed with guides to Nepal, Africa, New Zealand and New Guinea.In 1977’s Africa on the Cheap, readers were advised to enjoy the “Bonadir weavers and old mosques” of Mogadishu, while a guide to the Middle East offered advice on hitch-hiking to Baghdad from Syria. But, it was the success of the 1981 India guide that put Lonely Planet in the backpacks of many young traveller hungry for foreign experiences.“I remain proud of what Lonely Planet achieved,” says Tony Wheeler. “I’m always delighted when people say, ‘I wouldn’t have gone there if LP hadn’t have given me a push, showed me the way.’”Ryan Ver Berkmoes, the veteran writer, one-time Lonely Plant publisher and author of 130 guidebooks, describes the company under Tony and Maureen, as “the friend you wanted next to you at the bar in the country you’d just landed in. Full of smart, savvy advice so you could start having a great trip. It was a rollicking and amazing place where you made friends worldwide.”I signed up in 1999 to research Ethiopia and – as with millions of other travellers – subsequent Lonely Planet trips provided foundational life experiences. I healed a broken heart researching the desert landscapes of Namibia. Years in Italy taught me to appreciate life’s simple pleasures. When my mother died, my grieving father joined me in Sicily. A working-class man who never travelled for pleasure, he was consoled by the cavalcade of treasures we saw. Last week, a friend phoned from Benghazi, Libya, to enquire about my health and safety – a poignant irony given that he now lives in a city run by militias.While part of the company’s mission was undoubtedly to introduce readers to offbeat or struggling nations, Ver Berkmoes emphasises the role Lonely Planet played in popularising travel in people’s lives. “It wasn’t just places like Libya, Burma (Myanmar) or Timor-Leste, there were few mainstream, widely available guidebooks for much of the planet” he explains. “Lonely Planet helped take the foreign out of foreign travel.”The company has also been a technology pioneer. There was a Lonely Planet blog in 1994, five years before the word “blog” was coined. A website followed, along with CitySync guidebooks on PalmPilots. Most innovative of all was the online traveller’s forum, Thorn Tree, launched in 1996. According to Jane Rawson, one of its first moderators: “A tiny web team was set up and told to figure out what the internet was and whether it was useful to travellers.” In 2016, Lonely Planet’s online community topped 10 million. Social media, it turns out, was kind of a big thing.In many ways, the company’s fortunes mirror the evolution of mass tourism. In 1973, the year Lonely Planet was founded, the US budget airline Southwest turned its first profit and showed the reliability of low-cost air travel. Since then, tourism has increased as travel has become more accessible. In 2017, the UN World Tourism Organization estimated that the world might see 1.8 billion travellers by 2030. That was before Covid-19. Now, even Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou of easyJet, the second largest budget airline in Europe, thinks his company will feel like a startup again once national lockdowns are lifted.Asked where travel will go now, Tony Wheeler says: “I don’t think the current crisis is going to end the role of the traditional guidebook – whether it’s in print or digital. I’ve already got the new LP guidebooks for travels I had intended to make later this year.”Ver Berkmoes also believes guidebooks will endure: “Once we start travelling again … so many old faces and brands will be gone. People will need that friend next to them in the bar with loads of smart advice.”He should know, as during his time at Lonely Planet he weathered two catastrophes that ravaged the travel industry – the 911 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, which devastated large parts of Asia. “The 911 attacks had a profound effect on the company. People stopped travelling and bookshops returned all their guidebooks,” says Ver Berkmoes. “The company lost dozens of talented people. It was wrenching for everyone. But travel did come back and so did Lonely Planet.”In contrast, the tsunami galvanised the company to help in a huge humanitarian effort. The Wheeler’s donated relief funds and significant resources were deployed to assist where possible. “We had people on the ground in all the most affected areas and we scouted for projects that would make a difference,” says Ver Berkmoes. “There was a comprehensive part of the website that answered practical questions such as: how can I help? where should I travel? how do I get home?”They are the same questions that many people are asking now, which is why the company’s commitment to its guidebooks is reassuring. If the future of travel looks more like the past – fewer trips with logistical challenges that are more carefully considered given new risks and uncertainty – then trustworthy travel information will be of great value. As I write, there are Lonely Planet writers emerging from lockdown in Beijing. They have a view of the road ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5d6af1061d11c592d34a585a90771ae55dff44a/298_0_2080_1248/master/2080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bccaa72ac2f0cccf877bba801d27f438","title":"democratic primary joe biden bernie sanders 2020","story":"The coronavirus pandemic effectively ended the race but a historically erse field had faced off before narrowing to two white men in their 70sThe Democratic odyssey to choose a nominee delivered one final surprise this week: a predictable ending.Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the entire campaign season minus a rocky four-week interlude, is the last Democrat standing after Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential bid on Wednesday.But the result belies what was, by objective measure, no ordinary quest for power. Epic in scale and rich in plot, the Democratic primary was at turns wild, chaotic and downright Shakespearean – all before the arrival of a once-in-a-century plague.Even in a Before Coronavirus world where politicians kissed babies and shook voters’ hands, the 2020 race included a historic impeachment inquiry, an unprecedented election night meltdown and a Hail Mary comeback.If 2016 was the year American politics fell through the looking-glass, 2020 is an improbable romp through wonderland.The Democratic primary race effectively ended where the presidential election will almost certainly be won: Wisconsin. But, thanks to the ongoing pandemic, it was a messy, borderline dystopian experiment affair.Wisconsin forged ahead with its election in defiance of grave warnings from public health officials and more than a dozen other states that chose to postpone their primary over fears for voters’ health.So on Tuesday, thousands of voters waited in hours-long lines to cast ballots wearing protective face masks while poll workers relied on hand sanitizer and, in some cases, makeshift hazmat suits.Dressed like a surgeon in a blue gown, gloves and a mask, the Wisconsin assembly speaker, Robin Vos, a Republican who opposed all efforts to stop in-person voting from taking place, swelled with pride at the scenes of Wisconsin residents fulfilling their civic duty in the midst of a deadly outbreak.“You are incredibly safe to go out,” he assured constituents with a confidence belied by his ensemble.Joe Biden finished fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire and a distant second in Nevada. With the weight of presidential history against him, the left-for-dead former vice-president looked to South Carolina for salvation.His fortunes began to change with an endorsement from Congressman Jim Clyburn, the most powerful Democrat in South Carolina and one of only a few political figures in America with the power to move votes with a single blessing.It was a blowout of epic proportions. He won every county in the state. Exit polls suggested that he won with white voters and black voters voters with a college degree and voters without one moderate voters and very liberal voters. Over the course of a remarkable 72 hours, Biden’s centrist rivals folded and aligned behind him in a dramatic show of force. He swept to victory on Super Tuesday – going from loser to winner in less than a week.In the end, South Carolina was far more than Biden’s firewall. It was a rocket-fulled jet pack that propelled his string of March victories and set in motion a political revival that longtime political observers swore they had never seen before.Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, spent nearly a billion dollars – that’s billion with a B – on a three-month presidential bid that triggered widespread fears – and plenty of criticism – that he might effectively buy the nomination.Bloomberg, the 16th wealthiest man in the world, spent lavishly across the US, hiring thousands of staff and flooding the airwaves and internet with endless adverts. His approach was unorthodox: skip the early states and run up the score on Super Tuesday.After rising steadily in the polls, Bloomberg won a place on the debate stage – where Senator Elizabeth Warren so thoroughly savaged his character and his record that she later claimed credit for drawing figurative billionaire tears – and earned a swath of negative publicity for his policies on minority rights as mayor and treatment of women as a media mogul.When the results rolled in on Super Tuesday, Bloomberg’s gargantuan effort yielded the grand prize of American Samoa. The US territory boasts a delegate haul of six, which he split four to two with the Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. Bloomberg promptly dropped out and endorsed Biden.But the saga of his failed experiment continues. Former campaign staffers are now suing Bloomberg for fraud, alleging that he tricked them and thousands of other employees laid off last month into accepting jobs on the promise that they would be paid until the general election in November. Now many are without an income – and health insurance – as they weather the coronavirus pandemic.At the lowest point of Bernie Sanders’ second bid for the White House, he suffered a heart attack. The political prognosis was grim: his campaign would never recover.Yet the “political establishment” – and the manifold other interests he rails against – had once again underestimated the Vermont democratic socialist.In a matter of weeks, the perennial underdog charted an extraordinary rebound. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed him. The left rallied. His poll numbers climbed. Suddenly, days before the Iowa caucuses, national Democrats were in full panic mode: Sanders was a runaway train that must be stopped.Sanders won the popular vote in Iowa and then picked off New Hampshire. Then, in Nevada, his political revolution finally arrived. He won across the board, dominating with Latinos and first-time caucus-goers. For a brief moment, before South Carolina changed everything, Sanders appeared unstoppable, his ascent to the nomination inevitable. There are few political events in American politics as highly anticipated as the Iowa caucuses.Presidential candidates spend untold resources and time in this state, endowed with outsized powers to set the course of national politics. But this year, the state would not be remembered for choosing the winner of the first presidential nominating contest.Instead it was the site of a disastrous results reporting meltdown.Caucus day arrived and residents gathered at churches, schools and gymnasiums for this quadrennial display of democracy in action. Hours passed without any results. Rumors began to circulate that an app designed to record and relay the tallies of this byzantine process had malfunctioned. By then, the reporting hotline was overwhelmed with callers. As night turned to day, it was clear the caucuses had gone farcically wrong.The party did not officially certify the results until nearly a month after Iowans cacused. The Associated Press ultimately decided not to declare a winner.The screw-up was later attributed to a combination of technical difficulties and human error. But the state may never recover – with speculation that it may lose its first-in-the-nation voting spot. After rounds of recounting and re-canvassing, riddled by inaccuracies and inconsistencies, the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg was declared the delegate winner while Sanders won the popular vote.On the evening of the caucuses, with no data to betray them, a procession of candidates trotted on stage to declare some version of victory before jetting off to New Hampshire with every intention of never looking back.“Iowa,” Buttigieg declared, “you have shocked the nation.”Democrats have never had so many options for president. At its peak, the Democratic squad was large enough to field both sides of an entire soccer game, with subs.There were six women two black senators an Asian American entrepreneur promising everyone $1,000 a month a Latino former housing secretary a gay small-town mayor who rose from obscurity to political stardom a Hindu anti-war congresswoman two billionaires and a self-help guru who vowed to “harness love” to defeat Trump.But through it all two white men in their 70s – a former vice-president and the runner-up in the last Democratic primary – led the field for much of the race.And, of course, through all those ups and downs, the end result of that enormous field was the one that national polls had predicted from the start: Joe Biden won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f755628fad3c8255fb2a506c2224aae5d436371/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aafe4734f62c30a3a06752b5e08be390","title":"a house in the country how the pandemic exposes secret money","story":"I am among the lucky few with a place to stay outside New York City. My privilege is a reminder of a skewed societyThere’s been plenty of conversation about all the ways this pandemic has laid bare the brokenness of our systems: 27.5 million Americans without health insurance, the massive gaps in public health and healthcare funding, the two in five of us who couldn’t come up with $400 in an emergency.To many of us, none of this feels shocking – we’ve been grappling with the depth and breadth of America’s systemic failures for years. My husband and I are some of those people without health insurance. Our family just moved into a new apartment contingent on my husband’s new job but it is non-essential and can’t be done from home, so he’s not working. His paid time off is set to run out soon.This crisis has also laid bare the privileges some of us are afforded. In New York, people of a certain class are escaping to their country houses. Secret money, a friend of mine calls this, when acquaintances who complain along with you about the difficulty of making it in a certain profession or paying rent in New York City, and then you find out they have an extra house and their kids go to private school. But also, in my experience these last few weeks, this pandemic has exposed the privileges that some of us still have, regardless of how broke we are.In addition to being under 40 and without any underlying health conditions, in addition to our educations and my ability to work from home, we have access to my husband’s brother’s wife’s family’s New Jersey country house right now. I keep saying all those things – husband, brother, wife – to people when I tell them that we left the city to prove, I guess, that we’re not one of those families who have secret country houses of our own.I have been embarrassed by this access, in the same way I’m embarrassed to have parents who have money, which is to say, I find people having things that they did not earn, or people having so much more than most, to be sort of abhorrent without always knowing why I feel that way. Privilege is abhorrent, I think, because of how fundamentally skewed and unfair its allocation always is.My husband’s brother and his family also live in the city but left before we did last month. They also have small kids and are trying to work. They also lost a lot of income when everything shut down, and none of us is sure how we’ll survive as this unfolds. We’re all trying to find ways to make our lives work in the same ways we’ve always tried to make our lives work, which is to say, on the margins, patching things together, with the help of friends and family, with kids in the background always somewhere needing things. We’re taking turns parenting and cooking. We know there is a risk in coming together, more bodies and more chances of infection, but we’re not leaving the property except one of us every other week for groceries. Whether or not this is the right call, we’ve decided that it’s worth the risk.A couple of days before we left, we’d taken the children for a walk, and, angry at me over something, our seven-year-old had threatened to lick all the fences that we passed to make me mad. It’s a relief now to take the kids outside without telling them that they can’t touch anything, to have more inside space for them to do their remote learning and for them to play.The day we left the city, I kept asking my husband if he felt guilty. Of course, he said. But I’m also just so scared. It felt like we were abandoning our city, our friends. This weekend I got two phone calls about two friends losing loved ones to this virus. Four friends have been laid off and three others have been furloughed. People are losing jobs and houses, taking the subway to work still, unable to feed themselves or their kids. Every day we’re here I feel guilty, but also, every day, I feel a little bit less scared.Of course, none of this wipes the other worries. There is still the rent for our apartment, my husband is now filing for unemployment there are still grocery trips. I worry that the ends will never meet again for us after this crisis. I worry that we might have to leave the city and move in with my husband’s family in Florida, that I might lose my various jobs as a result. But worry has a different shape, I guess, when you know for sure that the problem is too big for you to fix it. When the problem is so obviously less consequential than all the loss that you see all around.For a while I thought this essay was about gratitude. I am grateful. I wake up every morning both numbed and bolstered by how lucky our family has been so far. But our luck is only further to the point of how completely unfair, uneven and arbitrary survival feels in this present moment. I hope more of us realize that, for many people in this country, it has always been like that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3640c2cb134a1236e456d2136a5a5d0d0621148e/0_240_6454_3873/master/6454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb89a2f7e1d245d6387b18cdca32183","title":"tech giants struggle stem infodemic false coronavirus claims","story":"Critics say efforts are too little, too late as research reveals vast majority of false claims appear onlineClick over to Google, type in “coronavirus”, and press enter.The results you see will bear little resemblance to any other search.There are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game. Government, NGO and mainstream media sources dominate.Algorithms and user-generated content are out gatekeepers and fact checking are in.Silicon Valley has responded to the “infodemic” with aggressive intervention and an embrace of official sources and traditional media outlets.Across the social web – on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest – search results related to Covid-19 are similarly predetermined.Instagram delivers a pop-up urging US users to go to the website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – or UK users to the NHS – rather than look at the memes and pictures tagged with #coronavirus.On Facebook, a dedicated “Information Center” includes a mix of curated information and official medical advice. On Pinterest, the only infographics and memes to be found on topics such as “Covid-19” or “hydroxychloroquine” are those made by internationally recognised health organisations, such as the WHO.It is a stark contrast to how social media platforms have dealt with misinformation in the past.US-based platforms, shaped by Silicon Valley’s libertarian ethos and protected by the first amendment, have long been reluctant to take a proactive editorial role or censor speech that could be considered political.They have had to be pushed, prodded, cajoled, protested, and shamed into addressing hate speech, anti-vaxx propaganda and the harassment of victims of mass shootings.On coronavirus, they have competed to be responsible and reliable sources of information. Yet still misinformation continues to adapt and spread, largely on social media.A conspiracy theory falsely linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic has led to real-world consequences, including threats and harassment against telecom engineers and petrol bomb attacks on telephone poles.Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington professor of biology who also studies and has written a book about misinformation, says the efforts of the social media companies are too little, too late.“They’ve built this whole ecosystem that is all about engagement, allows viral spread, and hasn’t ever put any currency on accuracy,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we have a serious global crisis, and they want to put some Band-Aids on it. It’s better than not acting, but praising them for doing it is like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.”Some of the more radical steps taken by tech companies include Twitter’s new policy to remove misinformation that contradicts official public health advice, such as tweets encouraging people not to follow physical distancing guidelines, and WhatsApp’s strict new limits on message forwarding.The platforms feel they can be much more aggressive on coronavirus misinformation than they have been on political misinformation, said Claire Wardle of the non-profit organisation First Draft.“There are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don’t have people on the other side saying: ‘We want this,’ the way you do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation,” said Wardle. “They are freer to act.”It is also relatively simple and straightforward for the platforms to select trusted sources of authoritative information – the WHO, NHS, CDC, etc – without appearing politically biased.Wardle faulted the tech companies for not being better prepared for the crisis, however. Facebook has long ignored the conspiracy communities that organise using Facebook groups, such as anti-vaxxers, followers of QAnon, and people who believe 5G is harmful. Coronavirus misinformation is rampant in those communities.And while the scientific nature of the crisis may lessen some of the external political pressures over how to moderate speech, it also brings with it a slew of challenges. The coronavirus is brand new, and the scientific understanding of it changes daily.Bergstrom described this conundrum as an “uncertainty vacuum”. “Any reasonable authority will not give you a straight answer” to certain questions about the pandemic, “not because they’re trying to mislead you, but because they don’t know yet,” he said. Another complicating factor is that normally trustworthy sources are not providing reliable information.“We’ve seen the US government, particularly the White House, becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus,” Bergstrom said.Facebook and Twitter have removed posts by prominent and powerful people over coronavirus misinformation, including the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, but the real test of their resolve will be whether they ever take action against misinformation by Trump.“We planned for years for this pandemic, but we never realised that we would be fighting a war on two fronts,” said Bergstrom. “One against the pandemic, and one against all the disinformation and hate and fear that is being amped up and enflamed by political opportunists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fbd1be7636cc82125518472fbcd27e7e177373b/261_2_1659_995/master/1659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b410b29280413b96afd735a80fef159","title":"five months on what scientists now know about the coronavirus","story":"Medical researchers have been studying everything we know about Covid-19. What have they learned – and is it enough to halt the pandemic? Coronaviruses have been causing problems for humanity for a long time. Several versions are known to trigger common colds and more recently two types have set off outbreaks of deadly illnesses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).But their impact has been mild compared with the global havoc unleashed by the coronavirus that is causing the Covid-19 pandemic. In only a few months it has triggered lockdowns in dozens of nations and claimed more than 100,000 lives. And the disease continues to spread.That is an extraordinary achievement for a spiky ball of genetic material coated in fatty chemicals called lipids, and which measures 80 billionths of a metre in diameter. Humanity has been brought low by a very humble assailant.On the other hand, our knowledge about the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is also remarkable. This was an organism unknown to science five months ago. Today it is the subject of study on an unprecedented scale. Vaccines projects proliferate, antiviral drug trials have been launched and new diagnostic tests are appearing. The questions are therefore straightforward: what have we learned over the past five months and how might that knowledge put an end to this pandemic?The Sars-CoV-2 virus almost certainly originated in bats, which have evolved fierce immune responses to viruses, researchers have discovered. These defences drive viruses to replicate faster so that they can get past bats’ immune defences. In turn, that transforms the bat into a reservoir of rapidly reproducing and highly transmissible viruses. Then when these bat viruses move into other mammals, creatures that lack a fast-response immune system, the viruses quickly spread into their new hosts. Most evidence suggests that Sars-CoV-2 started infecting humans via an intermediary species, such as pangolins.“This virus probably jumped from a bat into another animal, and that other animal was probably near a human, maybe in a market,” says virologist Professor Edward Holmes of Sydney University. “And so if that wildlife animal has a virus it’s picked up from a bat and we’re interacting with it, there’s a good chance that the virus will then spread to the person handling the animal. Then that person will go home and spread it to someone else and we have an outbreak.”As to the transmission of Sars-CoV-2, that occurs when droplets of water containing the virus are expelled by an infected person in a cough or sneeze.Virus-ridden particles are inhaled by others and come into contact with cells lining the throat and larynx. These cells have large numbers of receptors – known as Ace-2 receptors – on their surfaces. (Cell receptors play a key role in passing chemicals into cells and in triggering signals between cells.) “This virus has a surface protein that is primed to lock on that receptor and slip its RNA into the cell,” says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.Once inside, that RNA inserts itself into the cell’s own replication machinery and makes multiple copies of the virus. These burst out of the cell, and the infection spreads. Antibodies generated by the body’s immune system eventually target the virus and in most cases halt its progress.“A Covid-19 infection is generally mild, and that really is the secret of the virus’s success,” adds Ball. “Many people don’t even notice they have got an infection and so go around their work, homes and supermarkets infecting others.”By contrast, Sars – which is also caused by a coronavirus – makes patients much sicker and kills about one in 10 of those infected. In most cases, these patients are hospitalised and that stops them infecting others – by cutting the transmission chain. Milder Covid-19 avoids that issue.Occasionally, however, the virus can cause severe problems. This happens when it moves down the respiratory tract and infects the lungs, which are even richer in cells with Ace-2 receptors. Many of these cells are destroyed, and lungs become congested with bits of broken cell. In these cases, patients will require treatment in intensive care.Even worse, in some cases, a person’s immune system goes into overdrive, attracting cells to the lungs in order to attack the virus, resulting in inflammation. This process can run out of control, more immune cells pour in, and the inflammation gets worse. This is known as a cytokine storm. (In Greek, “cyto” means cell and “kino” means movement.) In some cases, this can kill the patient.Just why cytokine storms occur in some patients but not in the vast majority is unclear. One possibility is that some people have versions of Ace-2 receptors that are slightly more vulnerable to attacks from the coronavirus than are those of most people.Doctors examining patients recovering from a Covid-19 infection are finding fairly high levels of neutralising antibodies in their blood. These antibodies are made by the immune system, and they coat an invading virus at specific points, blocking its ability to break into cells.“It is clear that immune responses are being mounted against Covid-19 in infected people,” says virologist Mike Skinner of Imperial College London. “And the antibodies created by that response will provide protection against future infections – but we should note that it is unlikely this protection will be for life.”Instead, most virologists believe that immunity against Covid-19 will last only a year or two. “That is in line with other coronaviruses that infect humans,” says Skinner. “That means that even if most people do eventually become exposed to the virus, it is still likely to become endemic – which means we would see seasonal peaks of infection of this disease. We will have reached a steady state with regard to Covid-19.”The virus will be with us for some time, in short. But could it change its virulence? Some researchers have suggested that it could become less deadly. Others have argued that it could mutate to become more lethal. Skinner is doubtful. “We have got to consider this pandemic from the virus’s position,” he says. “It is spreading round the world very nicely. It is doing OK. Change brings it no benefit.”In the end, it will be the development and roll-out of an effective vaccine that will free us from the threat of Covid-19, Skinner says.On Friday, the journal Nature reported that 78 vaccine projects had been launched round the globe – with a further 37 in development. Among the projects that are under way is a vaccine programme that is now in phase-one trials at Oxford University, two others at US biotechnology corporations and three more at Chinese scientific groups. Many other vaccine developers say they plan to start human testing this year.This remarkable response raises hopes that a Covid-19 vaccine could be developed in a fairly short time. However, vaccines require large-scale safety and efficacy studies. Thousands of people would receive either the vaccine itself or a placebo to determine if the former were effective at preventing infection from the virus which they would have encountered naturally. That, inevitably, is a lengthy process.As a result, some scientists have proposed a way to speed up the process – by deliberately exposing volunteers to the virus to determine a vaccine’s efficacy. “This approach is not without risks but has the potential to expedite candidate vaccine testing by many months,” says Nir Eyal, a professor of bioethics at Rutgers University.Volunteers would have to be young and healthy, he stresses: “Their health would also be closely monitored, and they would have access to intensive care and any available medicines.” The result could be a vaccine that would save millions of lives by being ready for use in a much shorter time than one that went through standard phase three trials.But deliberately infecting people – in particular volunteers who would be given a placebo vaccine as part of the trial – is controversial. “This will have to be thought through very carefully,” says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. “Young people might jump at the opportunity to join such a trial but this is a virus that does kill the odd young person. We don’t know why yet. However, phase-three trials are still some way off, so we have time to consider the idea carefully.”• This article was amended on 12 April 2020. The original version incorrectly described the Covid-19 virus as measuring “an 80-billionth of a metre”, when it should have said “80 billionths of a metre”.

The health secretary, Matt Hancock, warned last week that the government could stop people leaving their homes for exercise if too many iniduals flouted its rules on social distancing.Professor Stephen Reicher of St Andrews University, a specialist in crowd psychology, said: “Perhaps the government could start by asking the question: ‘How do we help people to comply?’ Rather than starting from a punitive perspective, you start from a facilitative perspective.“If you start from a presumption of goodwill towards people – how do we help? – then one obvious answer is by increasing the amount of space they can go to.”With the link between access to outdoor space and benefits to mental health well established, Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a behavioural psychologist at UCL, said that the mental health of the poorest, typically those living in overcrowded flats with no outdoor space, was most likely to be affected by the lockdown.In addition to requisitioning swaths of private land, Michie also urged the government to seize empty hotels and office blocks and convert them into safe spaces for victims of abuse and domestic violence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f51afe3fc58ff6fb161ad60419b16845457030/0_290_6095_3656/master/6095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b9f74c49ffe033221811530d470cb39","title":"a chance to do something meaningful the refugee chefs feeding health workers","story":"Despite facing personal hardship, a team of refugees has been delivering food to hospital staff in Malaysia’s capital during the coronavirus outbreakIn a small shop-turned-kitchen on the ground floor of a block of flats in Kuala Lumpur, Mohammad Jaber, 60, is preparing a feast: 20 portions of bechamel macaroni with minced chicken and lentil soup, accompanied by basbousa, a traditional semolina sweet cake he and his family often ate back in Syria before they fled to Malaysia in 2012.“We have so many desserts in Syria, but Malaysians seem to like basbousa the most,” his 21-year-old son, Tarek Jaber, says.Cooking is what Mohammad Jaber does.

Since 2013, he has been catering for restaurants and private events out of this small kitchen in Kuala Lumpur’s Taman Melati neighbourhood.Now though, Mohammad and his assistant Mahmoud Mohammed Salad, a 22-year-old Somalian, are feeding a different community: frontline health workers at the Ampang hospital, a public healthcare facility in the Malaysian capital. They are part of a group of 15 refugees from Syria, Palestine, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan who have joined forces to feed those on the frontline of the Covid-19 crisis. Here, cases have risen above 4,000, and 70 deaths have been recorded.Three weeks ago when the Malaysian government imposed a movement control order prohibiting the operation of all but essential services, two advocacy groups, the Syrian Al-Hasan Volunteer Network and Malaysian Beyond Borders Malaysia, put a call out to members of their community to form a refugee kitchen.The response was immediate and overwhelming. “Just on the same day, 10 chefs came forward. We said we had nothing to pay them, but they said they wanted to help,” says Hasan Al-Akraa who founded the Al-Hasan Volunteer Network and launched the refugee kitchen with Malaysian film-maker Mahi Ramakrishnan.“In the end, Mahi and I raised some funds and gave each of them enough for two days of groceries. They have responsibilities and children to feed.” They have now cooked more than 400 meals for nurses and doctors and other frontline staff since they opened their kitchen on 23 March.The first time he took part, Jaber – who now cooks wearing gloves and a protective face mask – made mandi chicken with rice, a popular Arabic staple.“My father feels it is his duty to provide services for the people of Malaysia who have been affected by this difficult situation,” Tarek says as his father stirs saucepans in the kitchen.The refugee chefs – 12 women and three men – start cooking in the morning and have the food ready by 11am. A volunteer or hired driver picks it up and takes it to the health workers at the hospital. Al-Akraa helps to coordinate all this from his room at Nottingham University’s Malaysia campus, or even while out running errands.Like Mohammad, Al-Akraa arrived in Kuala Lumpur from Syria in 2012, with his parents and four siblings. When he was 14, while trying to help his family, he was arrested by the Malaysian authorities for working at a restaurant without a permit. Although the Malaysian government works with NGOs to provide some assistance for refugees, it does not recognise them legally, meaning they have limited opportunities to study and work.In detention for nine days, Al-Akraa met three Rohingya refugees who inspired him to start helping others when he was free. “I told myself I shouldn’t be complaining. At least I have a UNHCR refugee card, so I would be released, but they came by boat and didn’t have any documentation.”At the refugee kitchen, the chefs rotate every day, and next on the rota is 43-year-old Elham Jaber Jasim Musawi. She prepares chicken macaroni – which she often cooks for her kids – with the help of her husband, Hussam Kadhim Younes Al Mohammedawi. Her 14-year-old son, Danial Husam Kadhim, had helped her with the shopping the day before.Musawi left Baghdad with her husband and children in 2014 when Islamic State escalated its attacks in her country. Now they live in a three-bedroom flat in Kuala Lumpur’s Ampang neighbourhood. Lockdown has been hard for the family. The children watch TV and play football indoors to pass the time and Musawi is worried that the family won’t be able to pay their rent. Both her job at a local school and that of her husband have been affected by the restrictions on movement.Still, she is happy to help. “This is an opportunity I wouldn’t have passed up for anything. It’s not always that we get a chance to do something meaningful. We are all thankful to the doctors and all other medical workers who sacrifice their lives to keep us safe,” she says.The food is gratefully received by the nurses and doctors.“Even though they’re not from our country, they want to help us while we carry out our work,” says Shuhaida Shuib, 42, a nurse at Ampang hospital. “I think that’s very compassionate and it means a lot in these difficult times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59d46ca2fac3ef6d72a5741df98df461d3c6be7b/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b24e60c1ad65b240fd54c5c2369794de","title":"australian researchers a few weeks from clinical trial results for coronavirus treatment","story":"Early detection and finding drugs to reduce Covid-19’s deadliness a priority as experts say vaccine could be years away• Follow the latest Australia coronavirus news• Sign up for  Australia’s daily coronavirus email• Download the free  app to get the most important news notificationsAustralian researchers are “a few weeks” from concluding clinical trials of drugs to reduce the deadliness of the coronavirus by early diagnosis and treatment.The projects underline the strong medical opinion that a Covid-19 vaccine is several months or even years away.While vaccine research continues, greater emphasis now is on boosting detection and treatment in the quest to save lives.In addition there will be trials to evaluate the validity of so-called herd immunity in which iniduals’ resistance to the virus is spread.“I am actually quite optimistic we will have results at least – whether the results are good or not so good – from many clinical trials in the next few weeks,” said Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity.Lewin also is research leader for combined university efforts under the banner of the Australian Partnership for Pandemic Preparedness for Infectious Diseases (APPPID).“The timeline for antiviral drugs and knowing whether they work or not is much shorter than for vaccines,” Lewin told reporters in Melbourne on Monday.“Because these studies are using existing drugs, so we know their safety, we know how to use them. We just don’t know if they lead to clinical benefit.”The researchers are hoping to find procedures for early detection of Covid-19, particularly in aged care homes which house those most vulnerable to the infections.The health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Monday the federal government would provide $3m for research into treatments and diagnosis.Sydney University would get $1m of that for a lead project into the use of CT scanning to help diagnose patients who might otherwise have to go to intensive care units of hospitals.“This will allow for early treatment, better treatment, better recovery and better outcomes,” Hunt said. The remaining $2m would go towards projects headed by the Doherty Institute to produce early, rapid diagnosis of infections in age care accommodation.The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said early diagnosis of those most at risk would allow for earlier and better treatment and recovery.Murphy said the health system was “pretty close” to allowing a wind down of strict measures such as self-isolation and business closures. But he warned any relaxing of restrictions was “particularly risky” and he could not predict when that might happen.Murphy said the decision would have to be made by government leaders who had to be “absolutely confident that we have the best possible public health system that can detect, isolate and contact trace every new case”.“And that’s we have a testing regime that is one of the best in the world,” Murphy said.“We are pretty close to that.” Lewin said about 300 trials of treatments were under way globally.“There are a few good leads from small studies, originally from China. And now from the US and Europe,” she said.“But actually none of them have yet been evaluated in what we call a randomised trial comparing the treatment to standard care with a clinical outcome in a large number of people.“So we are really waiting for these results. Some will come out of China in the next few weeks.”And she addressed the controversial issue of herd immunity.“Many of you have heard of the concept of herd immunity, of people becoming immune to the virus without ever getting sick,” she said.“Well we still have no idea how commonly that occurs. To do that we need a blood test for coronavirus, which we now have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ce3e00dd946c9b49ff97ca35efa7c5b2517c48/0_34_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=152c642f951d14496c04c05d207851de","title":"bono helps irelands search for coronavirus medical supplies","story":"U2 singer lobbies South Korean president and corporate bosses to secure equipmentIn the global scramble for medical equipment and diagnostic kits to fight the coronavirus, Ireland has found an edge: Bono.The U2 singer has lobbied South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, and corporate titans including Apple’s Tim Cook, to help find personal protective equipment (PPE) and other supplies for Ireland’s health service.Moon’s office tweeted on Sunday that it had received a letter from Bono and that the president’s spokesman, Kang Min-suk, would respond in writing. The tweet noted that Bono had been nominated for the Nobel peace prize. The rock star met South Korea’s president last December after performing in the country.South Korea makes PPE and other medical kit that many countries are seeking to combat Covid-19.Ireland’s finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, contacted Bono in late March to enlist him in a public-private collaboration that last week obtained supplies from China, the Irish Times reported.In addition to Moon and Cook, Bono has contacted Jack Ma, the head of the Chinese retailer Alibaba, Marc Benioff of the software giant Salesforce and Doug McMillon of Walmart.“I just don’t think this is the moment for U2 to be doing a sort of Kumbaya thing. It just doesn’t feel right for me – it feels like a time for action rather than words,” the singer told the , which described the collaboration as an example of Ireland’s “soft power”.Liam Casey, the founder of the tech supply chain business PCH, which is part of the public-private alliance, said Bono’s lobbying had clinched new suppliers including a top executive at the Chinese tech giant Tencent. “The power of Bono on the ground – I was able to go to some of the bigger companies and that really opened the doors for us.”U2 has pledged to donate €10m (£8.7m) to support healthcare workers in Ireland, which is expected on Monday to pass 10,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. It has recorded 334 deaths.Last month Bono performed his first new music since 2017 with a song inspired by quarantined Italians. He posted the new song, Let Your Love Be Known, to his Instagram account and dedicated it to health workers and anyone who was “in a tight spot and still singing”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e775ab3b92e68c2fd0862b2d3ef4345302e991/0_252_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f79c75775d8f455e84706cb8e6408dac","title":"coronavirus conspiracy theories targeting muslims spread in india","story":"Attacks and boycotts escalate amid false claims that Muslim group to blame for epidemicThe men who beat Mehboob Ali did so without mercy. Dragging him to a field in the village of Harewali, on the fringes of north-west Delhi, the group hit him with sticks and shoes until he bled from his nose and ears. Ali was a Muslim, recently returned home from a religious gathering, and the Hindu mob was quite certain he was part of a so-called Islamic conspiracy to spread coronavirus to Hindus nationwide. His attackers believed the devout 22-year-old must be punished before he carried out “corona jihad”.The allegations were entirely false, but according to video footage and his family, the men who beat Ali on 5 April were in little doubt of his guilt, demanding: “Tell us who else is behind this conspiracy.” Ali was then taken to a nearby Hindu temple and told to renounce Islam and convert to Hinduism before they would allow him to go to hospital. Five days after the attack Ali’s family was still in fear of also being accused of spreading the virus. “If we file a police case, the Hindus will not let us live in the village,” said one family member, who asked not to be named. Police confirmed that due to his attendance at a Muslim convention in Bhopal a few weeks back, Ali was being held in the isolation ward of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan hospital in Delhi as a “corona suspect”, though he had no symptoms.The attack on Ali is symptomatic of the growing demonisation of India’s Muslim community, who are being accused, without any basis, of conducting a malevolent campaign to spread Covid-19 to the Hindu majority.Already a minority under attack – it is just weeks since Hindu mobs attacked Muslims in religious riots in Delhi – Muslims have now seen their businesses across India boycotted, volunteers distributing rations called “coronavirus terrorists”, and others accused of spitting in food and infecting water supplies with the virus. Posters have appeared barring Muslims from entering certain neighbourhoods in states as far apart as Delhi, Karnataka, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh.The troubles began when the gathering of an Islamic missionary organisation, Tablighi Jamaat, held in mid-March in the south Delhi neighbourhood of Nizamuddin, was singled out by police and government as being responsible for the spread of coronavirus across India. The convention, which had been given the go-ahead by the Delhi authorities, was attended by about 8,000 people, including hundreds of foreigners. It soon became apparent that many at the convention had unknowingly picked up Covid-19 and brought it back to towns and villages across India.Across the country, police were ordered to round up anyone associated with the organisation. So far, more than 27,000 Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts have been quarantined in about 15 states. In Uttar Pradesh, the police offered up to 10,000 rupees (£105) for information on anyone who had attended the gathering.In a statement this week, the Indian Scientists’ Response to Covid-19 group said “the available data does not support the speculation” that the blame for the coronavirus epidemic in India lies mainly with Tablighi Jamaat. The scientists emphasised that while testing for coronavirus is extremely low across India, a disproportionate number have been of members of Tablighi Jamaat, as per a government order, therefore heavily skewing the figures.Yet the test results were swiftly seized upon by members of the ruling ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who claimed Tablighi Jamaat members had intended to infect millions as part of an Islamic conspiracy and were carrying out “corona terrorism”.Senior BJP leaders accused Tablighi Jamaat of carrying out a “Talibani crime”, described their members as “human bombs, but in the guise of coronavirus patients”, and called for Tablighi Jamaat leaders to be both hanged and shot. Kapil Mishra, a local BJP leader notorious for hate speeches, tweeted: “Tablighi Jamaat people have begun spitting on the doctors and other health workers. It’s clear, their aim is to infect as many people as possible with coronavirus and kill them.”Though quickly debunked, the rumours of Tablighi Jamaat members refusing to go into quarantine, assaulting hospital staff and throwing bottles of urine at Hindus quickly spread.Hashtags such as “coronaJihad”, “CoronaTerrorism” and “CoronaBombsTablighi” began to trend on Twitter in India. Mainstream Indian media repeatedly asserted that Tablighi Jamaat members were coronavirus “superspreaders”.Dr Zafarul-Islam Khan, chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, said that while Tablighi Jamaat had been shortsighted in holding the convention, there were “dozens of examples of government, political parties and other religious groups who also flouted the coronavirus restrictions and gathered in large numbers”.He added: “But the whole focus is being directed only on Muslims. In the past few days, we have noted a new wave of attacks on Muslims across the country. There is talk of social boycott of Muslims, harassment of Muslims by Hindutva groups and Muslims are even being harassed by police in various areas.”There has been a concentration of attacks against Muslims in Karnataka, where a BJP MP, Anant Kumar Hegde, has denounced Tablighi Jamaat as terrorists. Shortly after, an audio clip began to be shared widely over WhatsApp, urging people not to allow Muslim fruit and vegetable sellers into their areas, claiming they were spreading the virus through their produce.Sayed Tabrez, 23, and his mother, Zareen Taj, 39, were among seven Muslim volunteers who were assaulted by a gang of local BJP members on 4 and 6 April, as they tried to distribute food to impoverished people in the Marathahalli and Dasarahalli districts of Karnataka.“Some 20 local BJP members came on motorbikes and started shouting at us, saying, ‘You are not allowed to give out rations – you are Muslims so you all are terrorists spreading the disease. We know you are spitting in the rations and have come from Tablighi Jamaat to spread the virus’,” said Tabrez. Two days later, about 25 local BJP members followed them in vehicles before attacking Tabrez, his mother and the other volunteers with bats. Police have since arrested two people.It is not an isolated incident. Manohar Elavarthy of the NGO Swaraj Abhiyan, which has been distributing lockdown rations, said dozens of attacks had been carried out against their Muslim volunteers in the past few days, including some by police.In Mangalore this week, posters started appearing that said Muslims were no longer allowed in certain neighbourhoods. “No Muslim trader will be allowed access to our hometown until the coronavirus is completely gone,” read a sign in Alape. In the Hindu-dominated village of Ankanahalli, a video seen by the  shows Mahesh, the village panchayat president, issuing a warning that if any Hindu in the village is caught fraternising with a Muslim “you will be fined 500 to 1,000 rupees”.The hijacking of coronavirus as an excuse for discrimination comes after a growing state-sponsored campaign to turn Muslims into second-class citizens in India, as part of the BJP’s agenda of Hindu nationalism. Attacks on Muslims have become commonplace and the recent citizenship amendment act, passed by the BJP in December, prompted millions to take to the streets in protest, saying it discriminated against Muslims.The situation got so bad last week that it prompted Equality Labs, a US-based south Asian human rights organisation researching Islamophobic hate speech, to release a statement urging the World Health Organization to “issue further guidelines against Covid-19 hate speech and disconnect it to religious communities”.“Just weeks after the Delhi pogrom where hundreds of Muslim houses and shops were vandalised, an uptick in misinformation and harmful communal language are leading to violence,” said Equality Labs’ executive director, Thenmozhi Soundararajan. “The threat of another pogrom still looms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/384f9fe9f17cdd5cd74d5eb10d4b0b858d758849/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9baf278797b7255ceaddbe290d113d6d","title":"coronavirus uk map how many confirmed cases are there in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

Supt Andy Cox, the Met’s head of road and transport policing, said on Monday that some motorists were still travelling at “extreme speeds” in London.He posted footage of a police chase involving a driver caught doing 151mph on the M1 at the weekend, while another was spotted doing 97mph on the A10.In Greater Manchester, police arrested a Mercedes driver for travelling at what appeared to be more than 100mph on a 40mph stretch of the A580 East Lancashire Road on Saturday.The driver was “totally unaware of the police car behind him”, the police tweeted, adding that he was “off to court” for speeding and breaching the coronavirus lockdown. The driver of a VW Golf was also caught speeding, at 106mph, on the M61 on Saturday, according to Greater Manchester police.But police chiefs have raised concerns that people are becoming restless and bored after three weeks of lockdown, leading to some getting back in their cars.Burnham said: “That will be worrying in any event, but it’s particularly worrying when more families are out and about taking walks, people are running, cycling, just more people on our pavements. The worry is with so many people out taking exercise on the pavements more crowded than normal. This poses risks to public safety.”A motorbike rider was arrested last week after being caught speeding at 150mph along the M23 in West Sussex.Giles York, the chief constable of Sussex police, said at the weekend that a number of his officers had been “verbally abused, spat and coughed on in the line of duty” and that there were still a few people who “think they are above or outside” the lockdown regulations.He added: “Please respect the work of my officers and my staff. They are taking risks, they are showing courage in continuing to deliver policing on the frontline. Please follow the simple message: stay at home and save lives.”In the West Midlands, police seized nine off-road bikes and arrested a 15-year-old boy and three men for “turning deserted streets into racetracks” over the bank holiday. They said the group were “running amok on our quieter roads during the government restrictions”.John Apter, the chair of the Police Federation, which represents frontline officers, said it was “pretty outrageous” that people were flouting the lockdown.Speaking to LBC radio, Apter said the authorities would be justified in closing parks or beaches if a minority failed to break the lockdown: “The problem is if people ignore the rules and we find that these parks and beaches are getting packed with people – and it’s clearly not daily exercise where they’re having BBQs or picnics or sunbathing – I think the local authorities are right to react to that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/591b7e078ffb9a6b5600964a2b321bf2485d91dd/0_148_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a426c5c5c819c2cd8321c89114ae402","title":"pop up bike lanes help with coronavirus social distancing in germany","story":"Road markings redrawn after cyclists demand more space to comply with Covid-19 rulesGerman cities are redrawing road markings to create “pop-up” cycle lanes for the duration of the Covid-19 lockdown, as cyclists demand more space to physically distance on their commutes to work.Local authorities in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin trialled a temporary widening of two cycle lanes on 27 March, arguing it would help cyclists keep the required 1.5-metre distance apart while car traffic was down owing to Germany’s coronavirus restrictions.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 69,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.On Friday, the council declared the pilot scheme a success because it had improved cycling safety while not hindering traffic. An expansion of the scheme on further roads in Kreuzberg, as well as in the Schöneberg and Tempelhof districts, is planned for the coming weeks.The council said it had used removable tape and mobile signs to mark out the expanded lanes, which can be removed when the current restrictions on movement are lifted.Residents in 133 other German cities have formally submitted applications for similar pop-up bike lanes to their local authorities on the back of a campaign by Environmental Action Germany (DUH), an environmental NGO.The campaign group cites new research linking air pollution to higher coronavirus death rates as an argument for redrawing infrastructure across the country.“The coronavirus is showing us that clean air is an indispensable asset,” said DUH’s chair, Jürgen Resch. “It is now especially important to temporarily make it more important for people to move safely on their bikes. This will help improve air quality, enables exercise in fresh air while keeping a safe distance and avoids unnecessary accidents.”Proponents of the scheme cite the Colombian capital, Bogotá, as the example to emulate, where the mayor, Claudia López, opened up nearly 72 miles (117km) of new bike routes in mid-March in the hope of reducing congestion and person-to-person contact.In Berlin, opposition politicians from the pro-business Free Democratic party have described the pop-up cycle lane plans as an “unnecessary provocation” by the bike lobby, saying they will have little practical use.German states have encouraged the use of bicycles in spite of the current restrictions, under which gatherings of more than two people are banned, with exceptions for families.“The use of a bicycle allows citizens to meet the requirements for minimising contact,” a spokesperson for the transport ministry in Thuringia told the German news agency dpa.In Germany, bike repair shops are currently exempt from state-ordered closures because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Three federal states, Berlin, Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, have also allowed bike vendors to stay open."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

It was then that she had an idea about organising a community clap for NHS workers after seeing something similar in her home country of the Netherlands. Now, every Thursday at 8pm, millions of people head out into the streets to clap and cheer for the people risking their lives on the frontline. She tells Anushka Asthana how one idea became a national outpouring.  The crisis is bringing people together in other ways too. Naveed Khan is using a customised vehicle to deliver food and supplies to vulnerable people across his home city of Bradford. Lucy Welling, an NHS nurse, had her bike stolen as Britain went into lockdown. But followers on social media rallied round and helped find the bike amid several offers of a new one. The episode inspired a new movement, #TourDeThanks, to offer up bikes to key workers. In Nunhead, south London, Claire Sheppard set up Nunhead Knocks to help out those living in isolation. In Sheffield, 23-year-old Sarah-Jane Clark is one of a number of colleagues who moved in to a care home to look after residents safely.

There have been over 1.3m confirmed cases, and over 75,000 deaths. Billions of people are confined to their homes and stock markets have plummeted. Here is how the crisis unfolded. Note: Data for the first 20 days is reconstructed from early WHO situation reports and the later progress of the disease. The case counts for the remaining days comes from the open source Johns Hopkins data repository.There are some tentative indications that “the curve is flattening” in Italy and Spain, as the number of new cases each day falls. But the UK and the US have so far seemed to be about two weeks behind Italy in the progress of the disease, so their worst days may well be yet to come. Similarly, although the Chinese city of Wuhan is gradually reopening after two months of lockdown, it is by no means clear when or how other countries will begin to return to normal. In the meantime, scientists are working on several fronts to develop treatments and possibly vaccines some of those trials may start to show results in the next month or so, but a viable vaccine could still be 18 months away.Data caveatsThe case counts come from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, one of the most reliable sources. The figures reflect the available data at the time this article was first published. Occasionally there are differences in the case counts between the Johns Hopkins website dashboard and the open source data repository used here. For the first 20 days, the evolution of cases is reconstructed from early WHO situation reports and the later progress of the disease. But the data should be treated with caution throughout as countries take different approaches to testing, and scientists believe many people may have been infected with the disease without suffering symptoms."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4223216.1586349269!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why is there an easter bunny and not an easter chicken","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Easter bunny is top dog in this part of the world but it’s s a fox in Germany and a cuckoo in Switzerland. You may have forgotten it – what with all the days morphing into each other – but today is actually a bank holiday. And with that in mind we thought we’d ignore the coughing elephant in the room for one day only and answer some of the questions that have been keeping us – and other people – up at night for donkey’s years.We had some troubling queries of our own that we felt needed to be urgently addressed and took to Twitter in search of similarly pressing questions that people felt they needed answered. Then we threw everything into the pot and this is what came out.Yesterday was Easter Sunday – a day marked, this year as ever, with the gorging of chocolate. But why do we celebrate what many believe was a crucifixion followed by a resurrection with the eating of egg-shaped chocolate?Back in the day, Christian churches frowned on those who ate eggs – normal eggs – during Holy Week, the seven days between Palm Sunday and yesterday. No, we don’t know why they did that, either. As a result, strict observers of the rules did not eat any of the eggs their chickens laid. They set them aside. Then, rather than seeing them go to waste, some people started decorating them to give to children as gifts on the big day. The Victorians made this tradition their own but rather than using real eggs, they fashioned them out of cardboard, covered them with fancy cloth and filled them with gifts. The Germans added chocolate to the mix and so a tradition was born.Why do we have an Easter bunny? Wouldn’t an Easter chicken make more sense? When you’re talking about a rabbit sneaking about the place with a bag full of chocolate eggs to hide, sense doesn’t really come into it, now does it? The Easter bunny is top dog in this part of the world but it’s s a fox in Germany and a cuckoo in Switzerland.Speaking of eggs, should the regular ones go in the fridge?Well that depends on where in the world you are. In the United States and Japan, the food safety authorities insist that all eggs are cleaned before making their way to shops. They do this to reduce the spread of salmonella from the gunk sometimes found on shells. In the European Union, on the other hand, regulations forbid egg washing over fears that washing an egg damages its protective cuticle which stops bad bacteria entering the egg. So in this country your eggs don’t need to go in the fridge. Most people still put them there, mind you – because they have to go somewhere and don’t fridges come with an egg holder? If you do chill your eggs you are supposed to bring them to room temperature before cooking, so they don’t end up runnier than you like them. Like anyone has time for that.What about tomatoes? Should they be kept in the fridge?Absolutely not. Tomatoes are sensitive to low temperatures and your fridge will reduce the activity of their enzyme-producing genes and degrade their flavour. So store them at room temperature and eat them before they start to rot. Pricewatch adopted this approach a while back and the fruit flies went mad for the tomatoes so back in the fridge they went.Why are eggs so hard to find in my supermarket?Because retailers keep moving them around like some class of corporate Easter bunny. They know eggs are a staple which people often come into the shop to buy. And they don’t require a fridge like dairy products or a huge amount of dedicated space like bread. So if the eggs get moved about sporadically throughout the year shoppers have to wander the aisles on occasion looking for the damn things. While on their wanders, they are led to parts of the store they might otherwise ignore and by doing that they might buy things they had not intended to buy.Speaking of supermarkets, why is the booze always on the last aisle of a supermarket?This is another example of retailers playing with us. They put all the healthy and colourful things – fruit, vegetables, flowers and the like – at the start of your shopping journey and the treats and booze at the end. By the time we have made our way around the shop and arrive at the booze aisle we are pleased with all the healthy stuff so happily add some not-so-healthy stuff. If the booze was in the first aisle we visited, then for a spell, our trollies would just have wine, beer or spirits in them and that might make us feel bad – and less inclined to buy as much of the stuff.What is that whirring sound an ATM makes?It is nothing sound. It is certainly not the machine counting out your notes. The great god of the internet has told us that the noise is produced by a speaker so users will be assured their money is on the way and in the absence of the noise, the machine would be silent.If a steak has a use -by date of today and I cook it, can I eat it tomorrow?Yes, cooking a product that is just about to pass its use-by date typically extends its edible life by two or three days.How do they work out the best-before and use-by dates anyway?Manufacturers rely on a heady cocktail of maths, experience, testing and guessing. Equations are sometimes used to work out when food will turn using a predicted rate of bacteria growth. Another approach is to rely on past experience with a particular products. Testing is sometime done to establish a shelf life. A product gets put through whatever conditions it may experience in the retail chain to see what impact light and temperature and movement have on it. The product is tested repeatedly and when it goes bad, it will have a certain date. The maker will then take off a few days off to give it a safety net and that is the use-by or best-before date. And then sometimes, with a product in an airtight can, for example, they just pick a random date in the future run with it.Where does the lovely new car smell come from?Is it really that lovely though? What you are smelling in a new car is vinyl and plastic and glue minus the human odours we add to the mix. The smell is made of more than 50 volatile organic compounds. The compounds break down at a rate of about 20 per cent per week, so after a month they will have all but disappeared. The new car smell might disappear for good in the years ahead as carmakers are busy working out ways to make cars without all the sealants and solvents that give new cars their unique odour.Why are things often priced in amounts ending in 99?It is probably not what you think. Or at least it wasn’t at the start. Most people think such a pricing system is done to fool us into thinking things are cheaper than they are. In the 19th century mechanical registers could not issue receipts or do internal tallies. So they only way a store owner could know a sale was happening if he was elsewhere in the shop was through the sound of the cash register opening. When everything was priced at numbers ending in nine, cashiers had to open the tills to give a penny in change, so every sale was audible.And speaking of 99s, why is a 99 called a 99? Thank the Italians. And Cadbury. When Italy had monarchs, the king was always assigned an elite guard made up of 99 soldiers and, as a result, the fanciest of things became known as 99s. Fast forward to the 1930s, when Cadbury launched a little Flake specially for ice-cream cones. The ice-cream business was dominated by expat Italians and, to appeal to those key buyers, Cadbury’s called their innovation a 99.Why isn’t a size 12 or 14 the same in all shops?Women’s clothes sizes are mostly meaningless. Sizes became a thing only in the 1920s with the rollout of mass-production techniques. In the 1930s, the authorities in the United States set out to create a standard system. Then war intervened so it took almost 20 years for a commercial standard to be arrived at. It combined figures for bust, height and hip. The system was almost immediately out of date, as body shapes had changed a lot between 1939 and the 1960s. They have continued to change in the US and here. To add to the confusion, sizes in the US, Ireland, the rest of Europe and elsewhere are all different, so a US size six can be an Irish eight, a French 36 or a Japanese nine.How long does a bottle of wine last after opening?While we are tempted to say as long as it takes to drink it there is a better answer. If you put the cork back in a bottle of unfinished wine and stick it in the fridge – red included – you limit the wine’s exposure to oxygen, heat and light so it should last from two to five days, with wines with more tannin lasting longer. If you forget to recork and refrigerate it, it might be gone before you wake up on the morning after the night before.Are generic painkillers as good as branded ones?Yes. The only difference between an expensive, branded painkiller and a very cheap generic one is the price, because both are made with the same active ingredients and have to pass the same stringent tests set by the authorities.Obviously but that does not mean a scoop of buttery mash constitutes one of your five a day – or five scoops five of your five a day. Despite being entirely natural and full of vitamins and minerals, potatoes are a starchy food. So nutritionists cross them off the good-vegetable list and lump them in with pasta and rice, as a carbohydrate.What is the difference between red and white cheddar?Dye. Red cheddar and white cheddar are the same cheese but the red one has colouring added. And why would anyone bother dying cheese? Makers of Cheshire cheese used to make cheap and premium products, with the former identifiable by red food colouring. Then they started doing something similar in Leicester. People seemed to like red cheese, so the cheddar makers got on board.Why would anyone buy a hot-cross bun for a penny when you can get two for the same price? This came from a reader called Terry Treanor. It is a great question. But there is an answer. You should only buy as many hot-cross buns as you and your daughters and your son need. Do not be stockpiling the hot-cross buns. Even if one or two cost the same price.Is there any difference in quality between wine bottles with a screw top and cork? We found ourselves on winesdirect.ie when we went in search of an answer to this question. “There is a misnomer that the wine underneath a screw cap must be inferior” that site says. It suggests that this is “a misguided belief originally fuelled by Old World wine countries fearing the threat of up-and-coming wine nations such as Australia and the USA who began using screw caps instead of corks . . . We believe the important point in this prickly dispute is that screw caps are proving every bit as good as, if not better than, corks for sealing wine. In short, don’t judge a wine by its seal.”How do they get the figs into the fig rolls?We have no idea and no-one at Jacobs has ever revealed the secret. We can tell you that the company was set up in Waterford in 1851 by two Quaker brothers, William and Robert Jacob, and moved to Dublin’s Bishop Street – a site which was occupied by rebels in the Easter Rising. It merged with Boland’s – another biscuit site occupied by rebels in the 1916 Rising – in the 1970s and then everything was transferred to Tallaght. Rosie Hackett – of the bridge fame – was a union organiser at Jacobs and was sacked by the company for her role in the 1913 lockout. If she knew how the company got the figs into the fig rolls she never told anyone either.Who ended up taking the horse to France?They sent the young lad over on the ferry on his own. He never came back.How does the label on Imperial Leather stay on the soap until the end of the bar?Who among us has not wondered this? The soap gets smaller but the label stays the same size and it stays on the soap defying all the laws of physics (or, you know, none of them). Turns out that the sticker is not there just as a decoration but is on the soap to make it last longer and not get mushy. The Imperial Leather people have been asked this before. “When the soap is used, the sticker will make and keep the top surface, where the sticker is on, concave. After use, the soap is supposed to be upside down. The concave surface will help water run out from the bar and minimise the touching surface on a soap tray.”Can I recycle wine corks?Chances are a many Irish households will have found themselves generating a good deal more cork-related waste in recent days. The good news that wine corks can be recycled. It is both natural and biodegradable material and can become all sorts of things including cork boards, coasters and flooring. The bad news is that recycle centres in Ireland don’t commonly have the capacity for recycling them. They can, however, go in your brown bin and are suitable for composting.My nearest cafe offers a bacon-and egg-sandwich priced at €9.90. Would this be a likely candidate for Ireland’s most expensive bacon-and-egg sandwich?Well we can’t say for sure but we thought we might break down the price. You can buy six rashers for about €1.80 retail, which is 30 cent a slice. Let’s assume the wholesale prices is €1.20 (it’s probably a good bit cheaper, to be honest). If four slices go into a sandwich, the cost to the cafe is 80 cent. You can buy 12 free-range eggs in a big supermarket for €2.99. If the wholesale price was €2.40 and you put two eggs into the sandwich, the cost to the cafe would 40 cent. Add another 80 cent for the bread and you’re looking at a cost to the cafe of €2. Even if we add 50 cent for sauce and butter, that is still a hefty mark-up.What the hell is in brown sauce?It is a sauce – brown in colour – which is made with tomatoes, molasses, dates, apples, tamarind, spices, vinegar and other stuff. Chef and YR are the big Irish brands of this quintessentially English condiment. It was born in Nottingham in the late 19th century and has been great with steak and cheese ever since. We’ll not hear a word against it."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHealth Service Executive (HSE) chief executive Paul Reid speaking at the HSE briefing on Monday. Photograph: Photocall IrelandPA Wire.The Health Service Executive (HSE) is investigating an issue where people have been incorrectly informed their test for coronavirus was negative, when in fact they had contracted the virus. A spokeswoman said the HSE had identified “less than 100 people” who were incorrectly informed about the result of their test. The error occurred in tests where the original result was unclear or “indeterminate,” but people were informed it had been negative, she said. When the National Virus Reference Laboratory in UCD reviewed the indeterminate results and re-tested the original samples the results came back as a weak positives. “Unfortunately these indeterminate cases were initially reported as not detected and consequently were notified to people as such,” the spokeswoman said. People who had been incorrectly informed by text that their test had been negative were then later told of the positive result in phone calls from contact tracing teams, following the review of the samples by the lab. Contact tracing teams alerted the HSE to the issue on Saturday. “We are satisfied that no other patient has been impacted by this error. The HSE apologises for this error, and every effort has been made to ensure that the correct information is communicated to these patients without delay.”The issue emerged at a HSE briefing on Monday during which chief executive Paul Reid said the State’s coronavirus testing backlog has been reduced from a high point of around 35,000 people waiting for results to some 11,000.He said 25 laboratories were now being used to examine Covid-19 tests, including 20 in hospitals, the national lab in UCD, a Department of Agriculture facility and centre in Germany, which has assisted in reducing the results backlog. Speaking at a press briefing in Dublin on Monday, Mr Reid said nearly 8,000 tests were completed on Saturday. “We did build up a significant backlog…That backlog will continue to be reduced and will be reduced completely by the end of this week,” he said. Mr Reid said some 72,000 tests had been completed in the State to date, and that this has doubled “in a very short time”. The average daily number of tests being completed was 2,800, but the system hit a “peak” of 7,900 on Saturday, he said. There are now 9,655 confirmed coronavirus cases in the State, and 334 people have died as a result of being infected with Covid-19. EssentialIncreased testing capability is regarded as essential by the Government in considering plans to ease restrictions on personal movement, which are in place until May 5th at least. Senior Government figures stress that while they do not want to extend the restrictions further, they will do so if it is deemed necessary. It is hoped the current lockdown slows the virus to such an extent that will allow “space” for some restrictions to be eased – such as some pupils being allowed attend school on a limited basis – without risking a substantial rise in infections if this happens, stricter measures will be reintroduced.“Very preliminary work” is being carried out by health officials on how to “ease the restrictions”, according to a senior Government source, but the rate of reproduction of the virus must drop in the coming weeks before the limitations on economic and social life will be relaxed. To consider lifting restrictions, Minister for Health Simon Harris has said the growth rate of the virus, which is now just below 10 per cent, needs to fall below 5 per cent and that the average number of people in intensive care units being treated for Covid-19 needs to drop to near 100 from a current level of about 150.Mr Harris also said the reproductive rate of virus – the rate which measures how many people each infected person is likely to pass the virus on to – is now “in and around” one.A reproductive rate of 0.6 or 0.7 is said to offer the “space” to ease some restrictions and monitor the effect of such a move while allowing stricter measures to be brought in again if needed without risking a dramatic spike in new infections.On Call campaignThe State’s testing backlog was created after the criteria for referral was expanded to anyone with one of the symptoms of the virus, and has since been revised to focus on priority cases. The current demand for tests is around 1,200 per day, and 800 people are waiting to get an appointment at a testing centre, Mr Reid said. Outbreaks of the virus in nursing homes were an area of “significant concern”, the HSE’s chief operations officer Anne O’Connor told the briefing. There have been positive cases of Covid-19 in 268 long term residential settings, 214 of which were nursing homes. The health service had also identified cases in 32 residential centres for people with disabilities, 14 in mental health residential facilities, four direct provision centres, and three prisons, Ms O’Connor said. The HSE has had to increase deliveries of personal protective equipment (PPE) to nursing homes to combat outbreaks of the virus, she added.Quality checksChinese authorities have increased controls and quality checks on PPE shipments leaving the country, which Mr Reid said would have an “impact” on the turnaround times of orders from Ireland. There was also a “significant” pressure around the availability of PPE gowns across the system, and “until we secure a further delivery from China we will be tight on gowns in some places”, he said.In some cases protective gear is being redistributed from hospitals or community healthcare settings not yet hit by the virus to under pressure areas such as Dublin, Mr Reid said. The health service is in the process of finalising contacts for 1,200 people as part of the On Call campaign to recruit medics back into the public system. This is in addition to 300 medical interns who will join the frontline effort, and 4,500 non-final year student nurses who will work as healthcare assistants. Currently there are 862 Covid-19 patients in acute hospitals, and 148 of those were in intensive care units, Ms O’Connor said. Including non-coronavirus patients there are 275 people in ICUs and 135 spare beds, with a total of more than 800 ICU beds to be available during a surge, she said.There are currently 114 coronavirus patients on hospital ventilators, a crucial treatment to assist breathing in more severe cases. Irish hospitals have 1,100 available ventilators with a further 2,100 machines to be sourced from 21 suppliers in the coming weeks.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Minister says social distancing will be in force until vaccine available but restrictions may be \u0026lsquotweaked\u0026rsquo after May 5thPublic Health Agency figures show total number of confirmed cases rises to 1,882HPSC says clusters of cases detected in 140 nursing homes and 58 hospitals as of April 10thWoman says security refused to let her in with daughter due to Covid-19 restrictionsPSNI said reports received of street incident on Saturday involving group of men with weaponsBacklog of tests stands at 11,000 but should be cleared by end of week, HSE chief saysCork-based Sanctuary Mask Initiative providing protective gear to DP centres and nursing homesHouse parties broken up by police while parents drop children to play with friendsMan found dead on street after report of altercation in Ballynahone Close areaRolling out effective test would give greater certainty about measures to end lockdownPCR ascertains whether the virus is present antibody tests tell you if you have beaten itHuman rights body issues letter to party leaders ahead of government formation talksFor the first time in its 190-year history, the abbey of Mount Melleray is closed to visitorsPoll of 100,000 people reveals high level of understanding of Covid-19 restrictionsMasks, gowns, gloves and goggles from China pose challenges, HSE expert saysApproach to large gatherings, travel and work will all change, says Dr Ailis O\u0026rsquoCarrollInitial changes could include limited openings of schools, DIY stores and garden centresCork University Hospital model remotely identifies those with a rising temperatureCillian Wolfe went before court accused of violent disorder and intimidating a witnessStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227707.1586773432!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus the science the case for crushing covid 19 rather than living with it","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  in the US, said people should not assume a change in the weather will limit the spread of the coronavirus. ‘You must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing,’ he said. Photograph: Al DragoThe New York Times.The need to crush it:The longer the pandemic maintains its grip, the more disagreement emerges on the best way to deal with it. Within the world of science, perhaps the most significant ergence is between the “flatten the curvists” and “Covid-19 crushers”. The latter group advocates short, sharp additional restrictions.There are two critical aspects to this. Firstly, any seasonal benefit – such as warm weather and high humidity (great for killing off flu) – may be cancelled by humanity’s vulnerability to the virus.“One should not assume that we are going to be rescued by a change in the weather. You must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing,” declared Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, on ABC’s Good Morning America. Fauci is the man who causes Donald Trump’s teeth to grind whenever he gives his latest update.The second difficulty is the “flatten the curve goes on for years” in the absence of a vaccine. That is why we need to weigh up balances, especially in the context of beginning to ease restrictions.A key assumption of the flatten strategy is that around the same number of people will eventually be infected with Covid-19, but just over a longer time period. Many models predict this period, which could require intermittent lockdowns, might last for up to two years.Dr Harvey Fineberg, past president of the US National Academy of Medicine, is in no doubt a different path is needed.“The aim is not to flatten the curve. The goal is to crush the curve,” he wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine.New Zealand is held up as the best pupil in the class. It has had just 1,049 confirmed cases and four deaths since February 28th. Just 14 people were in hospital with the virus as of Saturday, April 11th.RCSI infectious disease specialist Prof Sam McConkey has summarised in a tweet what that might entail, and interestingly noted it would have to be on all-Ireland basis if we were go that route:“In Ireland, should we follow New Zealand, eliminate SARSCoV2 from the island through 60 days of contact-tracing and self-isolating in \u0026lt3h, use GPS location data, 14-day quarantine for travellers, cloth reusable masks for all, phone app to show status, phased openings, all with NI.”Ireland v. UK:A big question is why the pandemic has played out in the State in a discernibly different way to the UK, and to some extent Northern Ireland.Yes, we moved quicker to physical distancing and restricting movement, while it’s almost as if there was a strange, three-week delay in hard but necessary messaging across the water, trying to catch up on the lack of urgency and clarity early on. But there is more to it than that.Researcher Lainey Doyle, who specialised in the history of medicine, made telling comparisons on twitter. It started out with health systems roughly on a par for instance the UK had 6.6 ICU beds per 100,000 people the Irish equivalent was 6.5.Then deviation becomes more evident. Ireland has performed 8.69 tests per 1,000 population the UK equivalent is four.Currently, UK death rates are more than double those in Ireland 14.8 deaths per 100,000 people compared to 6.5 here (More than 10,000 deaths in the UK compared to 334 deaths as of Sunday in the State).The UK hit 1,000 deaths in a single day, coinciding with 2,000 deaths a day in the US. Remarkably, it is accounting for 10 per cent of global deaths from Covid-19, while the US daily death record is in a country with five times the population of Britain.Global race update:The race against the common enemy continues with unprecedented intensity on three fronts: to produce a vaccine to generate antiviral treatments and to engineer a validated antibody test kit to show if a person has had Covid-19.A team in Oxford University led by Prof Sarah Gilbert is confident a vaccine against coronavirus could be ready by September with human trials due to begin in the next fortnight. It seems to have stolen a march on CureVac in Germany. who flagged trials would be ready to start in JuneJuly.Pfizer and BioNTech are laying plans for manufacturing their candidates for trials by late April. BioNTech and CureVac are reported to be hard at work trying to get regulators to rewrite the rules on human trials.Meanwhile, the first results from Gilead’s late-stage testing of remdesivir (normally used to treat Ebola) are expected this month. If results are positive, expect regulatory approvals to come quickly – again raising ethical issues around fast-tracking. It’s quite possible the drug could become the standard of care for Covid-19 at least for a while.The necessary urgency at a time of pandemic is tempered by those scientists who say “not so fast”, given in “normal times” proving a vaccine works safely can be painfully slow.But as the scale of the pandemic becomes clearer, a provocative, ethically complicated proposal to shave months off that timeline is gaining traction, which advocates giving people an experimental vaccine and then deliberately try to infect them.Rubella vaccine inventor Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania told Science magazine a carefully-designed “human challenge” trial could offer clear proof of a vaccine’s worth at blinding speed.“We’re talking two, three months,” said Plotkin, who has co-authored a proposal which describes how this might be ethically done (his took six years, by the way).But “people who are faced with a terrifying problem like this one will opt for measures that are unusual. And we have to constantly rethink our biases,” he added.The problem is Covid-19 is so new. It’s not clear how often the virus makes people seriously ill or leaves them with long-term complications. Where you’re going to give somebody a virus on purpose, you really want to understand the disease so that you know that what you’re doing is a reasonable risk.Grounds for optimism:– R0 moves in right direction: Much hinges on the R0 value of an infectious disease. If it’s three, a typical person who is infected will spread it to three people during the period they’re infectious. Ireland has brought its Covid-19 R0 down from six in early March to close to one – in the US, it’s currently at six. If we get it below one, the pandemic will begin to fizzle out. The national effort has shifted to the next task at hand bringing the R0 as close as possible to zero.– Wins that matter: Let it be known April 9th was the day we reached a big milestone. It was best encapsulated by Prof Liam Glynn of UL in a tweet:“We are no longer on an exponential growth curve and this have prevented many #Covid-19 cases and deaths...Comparing our rates to some other countries our early actions saved lives...”But he did not allow room for complacency, adding: “We need to do more.”– Irish optimism ratings: Pragmatic optimism is needed as people face into weeks more of lock in amid much uncertainty over what Ireland will emerge once restrictions are eased. More than 60 per cent of adults were optimistic in the most recent analysis by Core Research. This positive level of optimism “is being influenced by the solidarity of actions from all stakeholders in society”, it concludes. Another action that delivers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227357.1586707212!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"europe pays high price for outsourcing vital health industries to china","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench president Emmanuel Macron talks to employees as he visits the Kolmi-Hopen face mask factory in Saint-Barthelemy-d’Anjou in central France. Photograph: Loic VenanceAFP via Getty ImagesUntil they were laid low by the coronavirus pandemic, few in Europe or the United States realised how much their countries depended on vital healthcare supplies from Asia. For decades, western countries outsourced surgical masks, ventilators, personal protective equipment and medicines to countries with low labour costs and loose environmental restrictions, mainly China. When disaster struck, western governments were forced to go to outrageous lengths to secure such supplies, often by shafting long-standing allies.In France, for example, the reserve of surgical face masks stood at 140 million, down from a billion a decade earlier. Healthcare professionals are supposed to change masks at least every four hours.During a visit to the main manufacturer of FFP2 surgical masks in France, the Canadian-owned Kolmi-Hopen factory near Anger, President Emmanuel Macron said officials had based decisions on “the certainty that high-quality masks produced on the other side of the world could be imported easily, so there was no reason to stock them massively”.SovereigntyFrance and Europe have learned their lesson, Macron insisted. “The day after will not resemble the days before. We must rebuild our national and European sovereignty.”“Nobody was ready, anywhere in the world,” says an adviser to Macron. In the short term, every country is maximising whatever national production capacity it can salvage, and scrambling to buy from China. Once the crisis passes, “the EU must protect strategic sectors, bring back certain industries, increase our capacity to manufacture and stock in the fields we neglected for decades, such as medicine”.About 80 per cent of the active substances in French medicine are manufactured abroad, mainly in China and India. “We will soon be short of essential medicines to treat Covid-19 patients in intensive care units,” directors of nine large European hospitals warned in Le Monde at the end of March.Three categories of medicine – hypnotic drugs, anaesthetics and tranquillisers – are essential for treating Covid-19, according to doctors interviewed by Radio France.Patients in intensive-care units often develop secondary infections in the lungs, for which they need antibiotics, Jean-Pierre Thierry of France Assos Santé said. “Usually, there are plenty of antibiotics, but there are practically no factories producing them outside China and India.”Ninety per cent of the world’s supply of penicillin, used in antibiotics, is produced in China. India, which is also suffering from the pandemic, has limited exports of 26 medicines and active substances.French doctors have substituted old reliables, such as Valium, for drugs that are in short supply. They are experimenting with lower doses, to conserve stocks. Some advocate using veterinary sedatives. Macron announced he had placed “massive orders” to swell reserves.About 7,000 Chinese factories now manufacture surgical masks, up from 4,000 before the pandemic. According to official figures, the People’s Republic quintupled mask production in February. The Chinese car manufacturer BYD set up the world’s largest mask assembly line and is producing 10 million daily, Le Monde reported. Chinese manufacturers of smartphones and protection pads for incontinence have also converted to mask production.French industry is also scrambling to adapt to the pandemic. Kolmi-Hopen, which Macron visited, increased its workforce by 50 per cent and is operating 247. By late April, it will have increased production from 3.3 million to 10 million masks weekly – still only a fraction of the billion masks that France has ordered from China.Air Liquide, the main French manufacturer of ventilators needed to treat Covid-19, is in the process of increasing production from 200 to 10,000 per month. Engineers from the Schneider Electric company, PSA and Valeo are converting production lines previously devoted to electrical equipment and the manufacture of cars to help make ventilators.Macron previously campaigned for European sovereignty in industries of the future, such as artificial intelligence and renewable energy. The pandemic has shifted the focus to traditional, basic industry.Jobless workers from the last factory that made oxygen bottles in Europe, at Clermont-Ferrand, are campaigning for it to reopen, because the bottles are needed for respirators. The factory was owned by the British group Luxfer. Former employees of an FFP2 surgical mask factory at Plaintel, in Brittany, also hope that the crisis could bring their jobs back. Their factory was purchased by the American group Honeywell in 2010. The Americans shut down the factory and sold its machines as scrap in 2018, when remaining production was outsourced to Tunisia. Both the oxygen and surgical mask factories were profitable. They just were not profitable enough for their British and US owners.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics live: Dominic Raab warns not to expect lockdown to be lifted this weekCoronavirus latest news: UK deaths rise by 717 as total passes 11,000M\u0026ampS CEO\u0026#39s daughter visited by police after travelling to Hebridian holiday home during lockdownClimate change could be worse than models predict as trees cannot sequester more carbon, study claimsSingapore to introduce \u0026#39floating hotels\u0026#39 for foreign workers to curb coronavirusResidents of tornado-hit US told not to let coronavirus stop them seeking shelterDonald Trump hits out at top coronavirus expert Dr Fauci after he says president ignored adviceFunerals must not be delayed during lockdown, Scotland\u0026#39s new chief medical officer warnsComment: After three weeks of lockdown lunches, it\u0026#39s the restaurants I miss most of allCoronavirus positive: good news round-up - pay rise for social care workers in ScotlandCoronavirus Q\u0026ampA: \u0026#39I can\u0026#39t get an online home delivery slot - what should I do?\u0026#39 Our expert answers your questionsNurse who helped save Boris Johnson’s life had ‘most surreal time in her life’ Comment: A police force keen to enforce the lockdown may not be such a bad thing.

Knowing my own hyper-social tendencies when the weather becomes clement and the fact that my book Welcome To The Woke Trials should be completed by autumn, I should have seen incarceration as a scary blessing which would guarantee delivery. But I actually wondered for a couple of weeks whether I should write it at all – #allinthistogether and all that jazz.Luckily, the copious whining and ill-will from Wokers at a time when the Conservative government is acting like Robin Hood has given me renewed purpose.When most people are in denial, they’re in denial about Bad Things – as a coping mechanism – but the Woke are the only group who are permanently in denial about Good Things, such as the generosity of the government, for kicks. It must drive them nuts that we’re finally moving towards a sort of socialism – not a performative brag – in which ordinary people become everyday heroes. The Woke in this crisis remind me of those dogs you see in pubs sometimes, who aren’t really angry, but utter one bark every ten minutes just to keep their equipment running.The preferred leisure activity of the Woke is, of course, virtue-signalling – and don’t they have a brand new box of toys to chuck out of their prams now! Putting on a mask and gloves just to go out for a pint of almond milk they get to feel like bold frontline fighters, looking askance at those of us with the temerity to expose our noses and knuckles.Hearing of hoi polloi relaxing in public spaces they can tut smugly as they tend their herb gardens. On social media they can advocate for avocados as a sure way to wellness with the implication that if one is sensible enough to eat clean nothing so common as the coronavirus would dare invade one’s immaculate innards.The three strains of Covid-19 and where they originatedThe plague has highlighted the gap between many groups – those who do useful work are more likely to get it than the useless, ethnic minorities are more likely than white people, men than women, smokers than non-smokers. But I’d imagine that it will be spread equally between Modernists (my tribe) and Nostalgics – Hopers vs Mopers, as I think of them. We Hopers can’t wait to rush out and thrown our arms around our one and only world in all its corrupt glory once more the Mopers having got what they wanted – no cheap foreign travel, Mother Nature silencing the city – and are keen to stress that when we get out the other side we must not re-prioritise frivolous things over the simple life.That’s what they say, of course – what they do is entirely different. I wouldn’t despise virtue-signalling so much if it was just a prelude to actual virtue, but I’ve come to believe from extended observation that many practitioners simply use it as a smokescreen that enables them to be even more selfish than the rest of us. The “Woke Cloak” as it’s been called, which led to the amusing spectacle last year of the Extinction Rebellion spokesman who flounced out of an interview after it was pointed out to him that the many skiing trips he had posted on social media were hardly the “emergencies” that he wanted flying to be confined to.So in this time of contemplation, I’d like to speak up for foreign travel, incessant socialising and crazed pleasure-seeking. But for all you Nostalgics who’ve suddenly had the revelation that you wanted to live like an Amish all along, please do stick to your plan of staycations and home-cooking because, to be honest, you don’t bring a great deal in the way of wit and wisdom to the table and I think we’ll just about struggle along without you.And everyone who’s ever spoken or typed the words Big Pharma will hopefully go to the back of the queue when a vaccine is discovered (probably by the Israelis – none for you, boycotters!), stick to their crystals and leave the nasty newfangled vaccines to we shameless embracers of the modern world. And please, have the sensitivity to understand that for the millions of your fellow citizens whose lives were pretty damn simple already – eat, work, sleep, worry about money, repeat – what lies ahead is not a pastoral Walden Pond dream, but a living nightmare.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The uncomfortable truth is that, for a large proportion of the population, social-distancing isn’t much of an imposition at all, barring a few tiresome queues at the supermarket.Wealthy professionals in full-time employment, who haven’t yet noticed the economic calamity reeling towards us, can do their jobs from home with little disruption to their working lives, and with the added benefit of spending more time with their families. Some furloughed workers – particularly those who never much liked their jobs to begin with, and on salaries of £20-25,000 a year – are being paid to do nothing, albeit while taking a pay cut. They may even be saving on childcare costs.Public sector employees, meanwhile, are shielded from much of the economic impact I know of teachers on full pay who are being asked to work just a couple of days a month. The long-term impact on their careers of a period in semi-employment will be negligible. MPs have just received a pay rise.Obviously, I don’t wish to force these groups to share in full the sacrifices of the self-employed, the flat-dwellers, the newly-unemployed, and furloughed workers who have seen their incomes collapse because of the penny-pinching failures of the Government’s support package.The three strains of Covid-19 and where they originatedIncidentally, the devastation wrought by lockdown on all sorts of people is being overlooked: households that depend on one larger salary that has evaporated, or entrepreneurs who only recently set up shop. But it does perhaps provide part of the answer to why so many have surrendered their liberties so willingly – and have so little sympathy for those who find it tougher to abide stringently to the lockdown regulations.We are seeing an epidemic of snitching. Hotlines set up to allow members of the public to shop friends, colleagues, neighbours and strangers for breaking the rules have been inundated with calls. Social media is full of misleadingly shot photos of people sitting in parks or going into work on the Tube, accompanied by snide little comments about the “selfishness” of those who have dared go outside and attacks on companies that still expect their staff to come into the office.Where is the common-feeling and unity of purpose we are told is our national strength? If those who are enjoying a relatively comfortable lockdown are unable to “check their privilege”, then these restrictions will not be sustainable much beyond the end of the month. The police cannot be expected to enforce the rules more strictly.While some officers are no doubt enjoying the opportunity to boss around otherwise law-abiding people rather too much, most I have spoken to are anxious not to overstep the mark. They are mindful that, unless a consensus can be maintained behind the rules, then we can add civil disobedience and a collapse in faith in the rule of law to our list of woes.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Teachers must submit each pupil’s predicted grades to the relevant exam boards, which then go through a moderation process before being awarded formally to students later on this summer.Ofqual, the exams watchdog, has said that schools should not ask students to do any new pieces of work to base the predicted grade on. They said that in the interests of fairness, only previous tests and assignments should be used to inform their decision on the predicted grades they submit to exam boards.One mother told The  that her family had been financially ruined and now faces bankruptcy after their income dried up due to the coronavirus pandemic.Her daughter has been made offers to study at prestigious Russell Group universities which are contingent on her predicted grades. But when she contacted her daughter’s school to explain that they were not able to pay the summer term’s fees, she says that she was told without the final instalment of fees for the academic year they would not submit her predicted A-level grades to the exam boards.“There is no way we are in a position to pay fees for next term,” she said. “It seems very cruel to effectively blame the child. It is as though they are holding my daughter’s future to ransom.”Schools were told to shut their doors last month and send pupils home, with many offering online classes and digital learning resources.Private schools are now billing for the summer term, and many are bowing to parental pressure to reduce the fees since children will need to effectively be home schooled.Lord Lucas, a hereditary peer and owner of The Good Schools Guide, said that threatening to withhold predicted grades over this issue is “utterly inhuman” and “totally disgraceful”.“They owe a duty of care to the child,” he said. “You cannot under any circumstances hold a child to ransom in that way.”Neil Roskilly, chief executive of the Independent Schools Association, said he believes it is rare for a school to withhold grades in a dispute over fees.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists using coronavirus lockdown understand wildlife behaves","story":"As humans around the world have retreated inside, our animal neighbours have ventured further out of hiding. From cougars on the streets of Santiago, to deer in Nara, Japan and ducks crossing the road in Paris, animals that normally live in the shadows of our towns and cities have suddenly emerged into the light, looking for food or merely emboldened to roam. The situation provides a giant experiment in animal behaviour. But for zoologists and conservationists it poses a conundrum.How do you investigate the impact of a lockdown, when you are in lockdown?“I’m fascinated to know what’s going on in terms of how this sudden massive reduction in activity is seen by the animal population, from the roadways to the reduction in noise pollution,” says Graeme Shannon, a zoology lecturer at Bangor University, Wales, down the coast from the town of Llandudno, which was recently invaded by its now infamous mountain goats. “But if you were to plan an experiment like this, there would normally be months of design.”“We can certainly say there’s an impact on the ability of scientists to collect and analyse the data, because they’re not able to get to the field,” said Matt Larsen, the director of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama.“It means a lot of these observations are strictly anecdotal.”He recently saw racoons frolicking on the surf near his home in broad daylight - a first on a beach that is normally full of human visitors. In lieu of getting out in the field, scientists across the world are relying on existing camera traps and infrastructure to monitor the changes. Remote monitoring capability has developed at a swift pace in recent years, with lightweight GPS collars enabling real-time tracking and camera tracking sensitive enough to pick up even the smallest mouse. But most of the technology still requires the same maintenance as your TV remote. “We’re quite excited to see if these cameras can keep running. But our challenge is that we can’t go out to change the batteries,” says Mr Shannon, of a project to monitor deer in North Wales. “We’d normally change them around the 60-70 day period. They’re currently on 80-90.”CCTV and road traffic cameras could provide another valuable source of data, especially within cities, but are limited by storage capacity which means footage is often erased after just a few days. Science does have one new helper - ordinary people stuck at home, staring out of their windows. “People can start keeping simple lists of what they see from their windows and that can form a depository of what animals we have in the city. I\u0027ve seen people taking videos of dolphins that have just started to appear off the coast of Mumbai,” says Anish Andheria, the president of India’s Wildlife Conservation Trust.“During the lockdown, even people that are not normally keen on birds, for instance, are suddenly taking notice.Relying on citizen science has its shortcomings.Most of the sightings are in areas that are already home to plenty of animals - merely unbeknownst to their human inhabitants, who are normally at work or otherwise distracted.“In India every other day we have reports of tigers and lions entering villages, even during normal time. Suddenly now we’re seeing these videos, but a lot of them are not even dated, so this data is questionable,” says Mr Andheria. And images and videos are not always that reliable. Several of the images that have gone viral - of swans and dolphins returning to Venice, or drunk elephants roaming through a Chinese village - have turned out to be false. Then there is the question of the scientific value of such a period of unnatural upheaval. “I think it’s more of a curiosity, I don’t think it’s going to yield great new scientific understanding,” says Mr Larsen.  “As soon as people start re-appearing in cities and towns the animals are going to retreat and this will have just been an unusual vacation for them,” says Mr Larsen. For animals that exist on the waste of urban life, this time will be more of a struggle than a holiday and could have some fatal consequences. “We have a lot of feral dogs here in Mumbai, so what is going to happen when we see them interacting with the wild animals that are going to come out more looking for food?” Mr Andheria says.“One impact could be increased disease transfer from animal to animal as they are forced into greater interaction with each other.” What might be overturned in this period are our assumptions about what can be considered “natural” behaviour for our urbanite wildlife, and what is imposed by the encroachment of humans. “I think the key thing we’ll see is the times of day animals might be using areas. Many urban species are suddenly using the daytime as they would the night,” Mr Shannon says.“If you really want to get dark about it, this is kind of a macabre vision of what would happen if humans disappeared,” says Mr Larsen.And though many of these animals are likely to slink back into the shadows when humans re-emerge, there could be a painful period of readjustment.One possibility is an uptick in traffic accidents, as roads unexpectedly fill up with traffic again. “On the more positive side hopefully some people by having this experience will maybe have a deeper appreciation for the values of our natural systems,” says Mr Larsen.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china reports spike virus cases citizens return home overseas","story":"China has reported its highest spike in coronavirus cases in six weeks, driven by a surge of Chinese people scrambling to return from Russia through the northern Heilongjiang province. On Sunday, China’s national health commission reported 108 new infections, up from 99 on Saturday, compounding fears that Heilongjiang could become a new Covid-19 battleground and the source of a second wave of infections as the country’s lockdown gradually eases. The weekend’s caseload was the largest reported since March 5. A total of 98 of the new infections were imported, and 49 were Chinese nationals who tested positive after coming home from Russia. Although the number of daily infections across China have dropped sharply since the peak of the domestic epidemic in February, the toll has been creeping steadily higher because of arrivals from abroad. A similar phenomenon has been seen in South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which all successfully beat back the virus earlier this year only to see a rise in cases as the virus swept the globe and their citizens flocked home. Chinese cities near the border with Russia are now tightening border controls and imposing stricter quarantines.Heilongjiang’s capital, Harbin, now requires all arrivals to quarantine for 28 days and undergo nucleic and antibody tests for the virus. Residential units in Harbin, where people have been confirmed to have the virus, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, are to be locked down for 14 days.The city of Suifenhe, which was one of the few open border crossings after Russia stopped all flights and  incoming road traffic in late January and early February, last week announced restrictions on movements and gatherings similar to those imposed in Wuhan, the original epicentre of the virus.Provinces bordering Southeast Asia are on high alert while Inner Mongolia has converted facilities for virus treatment at Manzhouli, its biggest land border checkpoint. Hubei, the hard-hit eastern province surrounding Wuhan, appears now to be recovering and on Monday reported no new Covid-19 cases. Beijing, the Chinese capital, has announced that schools closed by the coronavirus outbreak will start a phased reopening by the end of April.Senior high school students will return to campus on April 27, and senior students at middle schools will return by May 11, reported CCTV.All pupils returning to Beijing must complete 14 days of quarantine before re-entering the classroom.  China has officially reported 82,160 coronavirus cases and 3,341 deaths, although there has been widespread doubt about the accuracy of the figures. In what appears to be the latest attempt to control the narrative of the coronavirus, China has now imposed restrictions on the publication of academic research about the origins of Covid-19. According to a CNN report, a central government directive and online notices published by two Chinese universities, which have since been removed, indicated that all academic papers on Covid-19 will be subject to extra vetting before being submitted for publication. Studies on the origin of the virus will receive extra scrutiny and must be approved by central government officials, according to the now-deleted posts.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/13/TELEMMGLPICT000228189501_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdPLLMxOyt4fQUM0ggA6t9IvMhyWP1NlODfwi1fLYifY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"coronavirus qa self isolating cant get online delivery slot","story":"Leave your questions in the comments section at the bottoms of this article for our Consumer Champion Katie Morley Coronavirus Article Bar with counter .The coronavirus outbreak has caused panic buying in the UK after supermarket shelves were left empty as shoppers prepared for a three-week UK lockdown to stem the spread.Retailers have been quick to respond to the increased demand, putting in place restrictions on the number of products customers can buy, as well as changing store opening times and online delivery slots to benefit elderly and vulnerable customers, and key workers.Some stores, including Tesco and Waitrose, have scrapped their buy-one-get-one-free offers.Supermarkets have been supplied with a list of 1.5 million vulnerable customers who have been told to self-isolate for at least 12 weeks. The list was drawn up by the Government in order to allow supermarkets to target the most needy with online deliveries.All the latest information on which stores are rationing items, the changes to opening times and what this means for the UK supply chain, can be found below.Over lunchtime on Monday 13 April, Katie Morley, The \u0027s Consumer Champion, answered all of your supermarket shopping questions. You can find Monday\u0027s Q\u0026ampA at the bottom of this article.Sainsbury\u0027s customers are only able to buy a maximum of three of any grocery products and a maximum of two on the most popular items, such as toilet roll, soap and UHT milk.As we work to feed the nation, we are also focusing all of our efforts on getting as much food and other essential items from our suppliers, into our warehouses and onto shelves as we possibly can, Mike Coupe, the retailer’s chief executive, said.We still have enough food for everyone - if we all just buy what we need for us and our families.Shoppers faced with empty shelves in a London supermarketTesco has introduced restrictions across all their stores only allowing three items per customer on every product line. They have also removed multi-buy promotions.Asda is restricting all items to a maximum of three per customer across all food items, toiletries and cleaning products.“We have plenty of products to go around, but we have a responsibility to do the right thing for our communities to help our customers look after their loved ones in a time of need,” the supermarket said in a statement. Morrisons has restricted all product lines both in store and online to three per customer to ensure everyone has access to everyday essentials. Some high demand items have been restricted to two, including hand sanitiser and toilet roll.Lidl have announced quantity restrictions across some of their products. They have advised customers to check in store for more details.Meanwhile, as part of a joint statement released last week with other supermarkets, they have called on customers to be “considerate” in the way they shop.The statement read: “We would ask everyone to be considerate in the way they shop. We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without. There is enough for everyone if we all work together.”Aldi has now lifted some of the temporary restrictions which limited the number of items shoppers could buy. Customers can now only buy four of the following products:Hand wash and soapCanned tomatoes, canned beans and sausagesBeers, wines and spiritsAnd two of the following products:John Lewis and Waitrose have become the latest retailers to announce limits on the purchase of some items amid the coronavirus pandemic. Waitrose, which is part of John Lewis Partnership, has announced a three-item limit on certain products and a limit of two packets of toilet roll. They said in a statement: “help us help all our customers - particularly those who are sick or vulnerable - by only buying what you need. That way we can ensure there will be enough food and groceries for everyone”.John Lewis has announced it is closing its stores.Shoppers queue to enter the Costco wholesale supermarket in north LondonIceland have placed a temporary cap on some items, such as antibacterial wipes and soap. They have also urged people to shop in an “appropriate way for the needs of your family and considering other customers when selecting products in our stores, and we would ask you to be considerate towards our colleagues”.The Co-op supermarket has become the latest to introduce rationing in its stores, limiting customers to two items of any product, and just one box of eggs.Government ministers and retailers have been discussing ways of ensuring that vulnerable people without access to online shopping are not left without food if they have to self-isolate. Retailers have begun implementing measures to protect these customers. Sainsbury\u0027s supermarkets will now open between 8am to 8pm, Monday to Saturday. They have announced NHS and social care workers will be able shop half an hour before stores open each day between 7.30-8.00am, Monday to Saturday. Additionally, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday 8.00-9.00am will be dedicated to serving elderly and disabled customers, as well as carers.Mike Coupe, CEO, said in a statement: I hope that you can respect this decision and will work with us as we try our best to help those that need it most.Sainsbury\u0027s will also be updating their online shopping availability, and from March 23 they will be adding priority access to online delivery slots for customers aged over 70, or those who have a disability.They have also identified vulnerable online shoppers through previously provided information and will be emailing them with information about available delivery slots.Tesco has announced all their stores, except Express stores, will be prioritising the elderly and most vulnerable for one hour between 9am and 10am every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Every Sunday NHS workers who provide a valid ID can shop in Tesco\u0027s larger stores an hour before checkouts open.Asda are offering NHS staff priority access to stores on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8.00-9.00am. While from Friday 20 March from opening time to 9am their superstores will be dedicated to helping vulnerable shoppers.An NHS hour will be in place in Morrisons stores from 7am to 8am Monday to Saturday. Meanwhile, the supermarket chain will be recruiting around 2,500 pickers and drivers, as well as 1,000 staff in its distribution centres to expand its online shopping services.It will make more slots available and also set up a call centre for those without access to online shopping, such as the elderly.Iceland stores offer exclusive shopping hours for elderly and vulnerable customers, NHS staff and social care workers.From Monday to Saturday, Iceland\u0027s hours are as follows:First hour of trading: priority hours for elderly and vulernable people.Last hour of trading: NHS staff only with valid IDFrom Friday 20 March, the first opening hour in all their stores will be dedicated to elderly and vulnerable shoppers, as well as their carers. Waitrose has announced they will keep daily essentials aside for NHS workers, they will be given priority treatment at checkouts and John Lewis Partners are putting together care packages to deliver to NHS facilities around the country.Aldi has not announced any varied opening times for older customers, but they have donated £250,000 to Age UK. “In these difficult times it’s important for us all to look after the most vulnerable people in our communities,” Aldi said in a statement.“This donation will help to ensure that Age UK\u0027s vital services can stay open during this challenging time, helping to ensure that they can continue to support vulnerable members of the community who may not be able to get out to our stores.”Shoppers leave a branch of Sainsbury\u0026#39s supermarket after an early \u0026#34Elderly and vulnerable shopper\u0026#34 periodBoris Johnson, the Prime Minister, has said the government is “absolutely confident” in the UK supply chains. “We will get farm to fork food supplies for this country and therefore people should have no reason to stockpile or panic buy,” he said. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has authorised a temporary relaxation, until April 16, of the drivers\u0027 hours rules to help deliver goods to stores across the country.A Department for Transport statement said the relaxation applies only to drivers supplying food and essential products to supermarkets.This includes the movement of such goods from importers, manufactures and suppliers to distribution centres. It does not apply to drivers undertaking deliveries directly to consumers, the statement added.Stores have also reassured customers they are doing all they can to ensure their shelves remain full and their supply chains running smoothly. Waitrose have said: “We would like to reassure you that we are currently working as hard as possible to keep a good range of everyday products available, and are working closely with our suppliers to help meet continuing demand.”Tesco has also reduced the hours of all its stores, with all stores closing at 10pm. Last week, it was forced to take its mobile app offline temporarily due to high demand.A spokeswoman said the reduced hours: gives our colleagues the time overnight to restock the store, replenish the shelves and support our online grocery service at a time when demand is high.They will also be closing all meat, fish, deli counters and salad bars, to allow staff to focus on restocking shelves and providing essentials.Tips for sticking to official hygiene adviceWaitrose cafes and rotisseries will be temporarily shut to help stores cope with increased demand in other areas. Due to the high demand of their online shopping service the cut off time to make changes to orders is now 12 noon. Asda will also be closing its 24 hour stores between 12am and 6am temporarily. The company said in a statement the move was to “ensure (staff) have the time to re-stock and thoroughly clean the store so it is ready for customers”.In a bid to prioritise essential items, free up warehouse space and employees, Asda will also be temporarily closing services such as cafes and pizza counters.Aldi has changed their closing times so all stores will now close at 8pm. Lidl has announced some store opening times have changed, and are encouraging customers to check their local store for details.Iceland\u0027s opening hours from Monday through Saturday are now 9am to 5pm. Sunday trading hours remain unchanged.Below are questions on shopping from our readers that the \u0027s Consumer Champion, Katie Morley, has answered. Send in your queries for tomorrow\u0027s Q\u0026ampA to yourstory@telegraph.Apologies to those of you who did not get answer today. Fear not, we\u0027ll be back, as always, with another Q\u0026ampA at 1 p.m. tomorrow. You can submit your questions ahead of time by emailing your queries to yourstory@telegraph. You can also sign up to our Money newsletter for regular advice on what to do with your finances during the coronavirus pandemic. And if you\u0027re looking for some extra Covid-19 analysis, you can listen to our daily coronavirus podcast below: Our last question for today comes from Hoshang Ghadially. Via the comments section, Hoshang says: My wife and I normally shop at our local ASDA and since self-isolating have only been able to get two ‘click and collect’ slots since mid March. It has been impossible to obtain a delivery slot and on one occasion my wife woke up at midnight to see if any such slots were available. I am 76 years old and do not wish to come into contact with anyone as I have a heart condition. Something needs to be done.And here\u0027s Katie\u0027s final answer for today: A delivery slot once every two weeks isn’t ideal, but it’s more than most people have been getting. If you have room in your freezer, you might want to start making more use of it in order to make your food last longer. You could plan your meals out for the next two weeks, making sure the food you’ve ordered won’t go off. For things like milk, perishables and bits you find you need unexpectedly, can you ask friends and neighbours for a small favour? I’m sure they’ll be happy to help.We\u0027ve got time for two more questions and our penultimate question comes from Joseph Gwynne:I have a bit of a coronavirus conundrum... I\u0027m 33 and on the extremely vulnerable list (bad asthma). I\u0027ve had the  NHS shielding letter and a letter from the Government telling me to register on their site, which I\u0027ve done. However we can\u0027t get an ASDA delivery or even click and collect for love nor money and we have had ASDA deliveries out of convenience for years, now they aren\u0027t out of convenience but necessity Is there a way I can let ASDA know I\u0027m not leaving the house on purpose?Katie: I’m really sorry to hear this. Double check all the details on your Government letter match up with your supermarket online accounts. All details (name, address, etc) will need to be the same. I would also advise complaining publicly via Twitter and Facebook, tagging supermarkets in posts. This may have the desired effect. Good luck with it.Here\u0027s one from the comments section at the bottom of this article. Another tricky situation. Esther Shepherd says: I managed to get an online delivery from Morrisons three weeks ago, not managed to get a slot since. I\u0027m 84 my wife is 81 who has now totally lost her memory and is in a great deal of pain and awaiting an operation (cancelled twice). Also we care for our severely disabled daughter aged 51 247 (cerebral palsy and learning difficulties). I have been trying to get a delivery slot, but get the same message daily, no slots available. Fortunately due to our mobility problems we have always kept our freezer full., but it\u0027s now almost empty.Katie says: I’m so sorry to hear about this. My advice is sign up to all the supermarkets you can, and keep checking back for slots. If you see one, book it right away. If this isn’t working and you need food, look beyond the major supermarkets. Many smaller catering firms are now delivering grocery boxes to doorsteps at a reasonable cost. Local Facebook groups and neighbourhood groups are good places to find such services. Alternatively, don’t be shy when it comes to asking friends and neighbours for help. I feel sure there must be lots of people in your area who are more than willing to help. You could always phone your local council for advice, too. Laura Hamiltonsays: Conundrum. I have been given Waitrose\u0027s priority access to the elderly\u0027s delivery slots so I\u0027ve been having Waitrose deliver my groceries. But I\u0027m 74, very healthy, active and slim. I could easily go to Waitrose myself, but I\u0027m wondering if I should keep taking a delivery slot some other elderly person might need more than I do. Should I relinquish my weekly slot so someone who really needs it can have it? Or should I continue to shop online by following the government\u0027s request to self-isolate and \u0027STAY HOME\u0027?Is there someone who is vulnerable in your local area who needs a slot but can’t get one? If so, then perhaps you could order some groceries for them as well, and drop them at the doorstep? You say you are fit and well, but at 74 you are in a higher risk category, so I don’t think anyone would begrudge you this slot. Also, if you give up the slot, you don’t know who will get it instead - it could be someone younger and even less at risk than you.Concerned reader Ron Mellor emails to say: I have just been to a shop where I noticed an assistant using a licked finger to open a plastic bag, later I visited a post office and saw the same method used to count money. Has any warning been issued about this?Katie has not only provided an answer but she\u0027s also willing to follow this one up with Post Offices and shops:This once every-day way of opening bags is now highly unadvisable, as it could spread coronavirus. You would be within your rights to have a word with the store manager or complain online. I’ll also be following up with the Post Office and shops to check they are advising against this, so thank you for bringing it to my attention.Another very tricky predicament here. A reader says: My wife and I are late seventies we are self isolating - as per Government instructions- you can’t get a delivery slot for food shopping at any of the Supermarkets. What should the Government be doing about this?Katie: If you’re not on the list of 1.5 million “highly vulnerable” people being shielded, you may find it harder to get a slot, although some companies are prioritising the older general population. For example, Iceland is prioritising over 65s. The problem is that, even with hugely expanded capacity, supermarkets just don’t have the capacity to give everyone a delivery slot. This is because normally more than nine in ten shoppers buy in store. The Government cannot just wave a magic wand and fix this, unfortunately.An anonymous one via email here: When home testing kits are available for sale will they be prioritised for key workers, e.g. supermarket staff, frontline care workers and the NHS, or will we have to be lucky enough to beat other shoppers at supermarkets and Amazon?Katie: I would have thought so, yes. They are likely to be in limited supply, so I’d have thought they would be given to frontline medical staff, NHS staff, care workers and key workers first.Telegraph reader Barbara has been in touch and asks: Is our daughter still able to purchase and deliver our groceries? We live in a rural area 7 miles away.Katie: Hi Barbara, yes that’s perfectly acceptable under the current government guidelines. I’m so glad you have her to look out for you during these times, and I hope she continues to do so.Via the comments section at the bottom of this article, Richard Budd says: Several supermarket chains have announced special times for the elderly how can they possibly use this if they are obeying the guidelines for strict self isolation?Katie: It is only the 1.5 million “highly vulnerable” people who have received letters from the Government, who must not leave home at all. Over 70s not in this group are advised to take extra care with social distancing guidelines, as they are at a higher risk from the virus.Another question via email here. Cindy says: Clearly frontline workers need disposable protection but for those at home is their merit in using household rubber gloves and simply washing them properly as you would do with your hands. Should I use them?Katie: You could do this if it makes you feel safer, but the most important thing is not to touch your face, and to wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Gloves are useless if you allow cross contamination to occur. If you have alcohol rub or antibacterial wipes, you could take them out with you and rub down your trolley, and wipe your hands and car.A very tricky situations here. A reader is considering leaving self-isolation as she can\u0027t get an online delivery slot.Via email, Elizabeth Jones says: I have been trying to get an online shop from Sainsbury’s for nearly two weeks. I am identified as an extremely vulnerable person. All phone lines to Sainsbury’s are either permanently engaged or answer to an automated message. As directed I have registered with gov.uk and Sainsbury’s but when I try to place an order it does not recognise me as a vulnerable customer. I have kind neighbours who will get essentials for me but to survive the next 11 weeks I will need more than essentials.  How can I contact Sainsbury\u0027s to rectify this situation?  I find this whole situation very frustrating, I am trying to abide by the restrictions placed upon me but in desperation I might have to leave isolation.Here\u0027s what Katie Morley has to say: I’m so sorry to hear this, Elizabeth. If you’re classed as vulnerable, yet still having trouble getting a slot, check your online shopping accounts are in your name, rather than someone else in your household who isn’t vulnerable. This could be affecting your ability to get slots. If that still doesn’t work, you should be entitled to free food parcels, so ring your council to let them know you want one. Failing this, I feel sure local community groups would be only too willing to do some shopping for you so you don’t need to leave the house.Our first question for today comes from David Lee. It\u0027s fair to say that David is pretty frustrated with the current registration process for getting priority in delivery slots. David says: I am one of the people deemed to be extremely vulnerable.  So far, I have received two letters informing me of this fact which means we are already seeing duplication of effort. In order to stand a chance of getting priority in delivery slots from supermarkets I have had to register on a Government website - they already know who I am because they’ve sent me letters. Why is something simple being made so complicated?Katie says: I know it feels frustrating. Supermarkets want to be sure they are giving slots to the people who really need them, and not just chancers hamming up their vulnerability. They just do not have enough slots for everyone.Afternoon all. We\u0027re back and ready to do it all over again. Today\u0027s Q\u0026ampA will be about all things shopping. Our Consumer Champion, Katie Morley is prepped and ready to go.

The first postcard was from Eastbourne, and the second from the Lake District. Return tomorrow to read Joe Shute\u0027s postcard from ChilmarkAt this time of year, Essex asparagus farmer Mark Thorogood is normally joined by 22 recruits from Bulgaria and Romania. The workers fly in from Eastern Europe and live across nine static caravans on the site until the autumn, harvesting his 25 acres of asparagus and 100 acres of spring barley, oats and rape.But life right now is not normal. A few weeks ago, Thorogood, a 40-year-old who is the third generation of his family to farm this patch of land, contemplated the first early spears of asparagus poking up the furrowed earth and made the painful decision that he would have to leave it all in the fields to rot.With the lockdown in place, the Eastern European migrants would be not making the journey this year. And it is not like he has ever received much interest locally for a gruelling and physically demanding job that requires up to 70 hours a week on the living wage (plus a bonus depending on the quality of the crop).And yet in recent weeks something he never envisaged has occurred. A nationwide call for British seasonal labourers to offer their services to replace an expected shortfall of 70,000 migrant workers this year has led to a surge in people volunteering.The charity Concordia, which has launched a Feed the Nation programme that is backed by various agricultural bodies, is already booked out for the rest of the month and is supplying 12 British workers to travel to Mark’s farm during the asparagus picking season, which starts now and lasts until June.Among them is a 55-year-old woman from Sheffield and another person of a similar age from Hertfordshire. Mark says he is receiving several phone calls a day, including recently from a woman suffering from angina. “She told me that she couldn’t bear the thought of my product going to waste and was willing to come and help in any way she could,” he says, though he gently refused due to the risk her health condition places her in.The new recruits, who will be staying in the same caravan accommodation as the migrants typically do, are supplemented by applicants closer to home.Among those to be picking asparagus for the first time is student Daniel Macmorland. The 20-year-old, who lives in a nearby village close to the farm, was living in student digs in Canterbury last month and preparing for exams in his second year of an environmental science degree at the University of Kent, when the campus was suddenly closed.Macmorland admits it is slightly bizarre to suddenly be out in the fields with the sun on his back rather than sinking pints in the student bar – but hopes there might be benefits for other students now in his position. “Students normally live on campus in the middle of a city eating processed food,” he says. “It will be useful to get that aspect of where your food comes from and in the future it might make people more willing to help out locally.”There are certainly worse places to work. The Thorogood farm is in Southminster, only a few miles from the sea, and a salt tang carries on the fresh breeze. Mark has won awards for his work promoting conservation on the land: the fields are alive with skylark and a lone buzzard swoops through a sky untroubled by the grounded planes at nearby Southend airport.Prior to the advent of rapid globalisation which created the supply of cheap labour from across the globe, agricultural labour was once a rite of passage for many Britons.Whole families would travel out from inner cities to spend the summer hop-picking in Kent. During the Second World War, the Women’s Land Army was famously recruited by the government to continue feeding the nation.In subsequent years, with agricultural labour still in short supply, some school pupils were sent to “harvest camps”.  reader Patrick Hollies submitted a letter to the paper last week detailing his experiences on one such camp where he was sent aged 13 in 1949 and slept in barrack blocks. ‘I don’t remember getting paid,’ he wrote, ‘but I learnt to drive a tractor, met my first girlfriend, drank my first bottle of beer and got a tetanus injection from the local vet after I stuck my foot with a pitchfork.’Back on Thorogood farm, Mark typically supplies his asparagus crop to New Covent Garden market which is then distributed to restaurants and hotels across London - Angela Hartnett’s Michelin-starred Murano among them. Demand, he says, remains undiminished during the lockdown with the farm shops he also supplies recording surging sales as people look to shop more locally during the crisis.It is not just youngsters currently looking for agricultural work. The sharp economic contraction has also led to many older applicants approaching Mark Thorogood. Among the new recruits is 56-year-old Matthew Beal, who typically works as a local handyman.Since the lockdown he and his wife, a self-employed hairdresser, have seen their work vanish and neither have earned a penny for the past three weeks. “I’ve never done this before,” says Beal, looking suspiciously out over the asparagus fields. “Normally I’m booked for three to six months ahead and I’ve got a list of jobs as long as my arm.”Self-employed joiner and landscape gardener Robert Hawkins, 45, has also applied to help harvest the asparagus crop. Despite having it in his blood – with both grandfathers arable farmers – he instead read environmental sciences at the University of East Anglia before deciding to work for himself in carpentry.As with 950,000 others last month, Hawkins registered for Universal Credit after losing his work overnight when the lockdown was declared – something which he admits “goes very against my instinct”.In between shifts on the farm, he has also signed up to be an NHS volunteer and is helping several families  who are self-isolating locally to him with deliveries of food.Even though he has financially suffered, he sees some good in the lockdown and a recalibrating of society’s priorities. “We’ve had so much luxury in recent times and social media has helped us become more self-absorbed,” he says. “I think this could remind people of the true value of society.”Mark Thorogood shares the hope that the national campaign to recruit volunteers will refocus minds on the importance of farm labourers, who are classed as key workers under the lockdown guidelines but often carry out their work unnoticed and unappreciated.Even during recent weeks, elsewhere in the country some specially-chartered aircraft are still flying Eastern European labourers in and Mark doesn’t anticipate the homegrown volunteers to be here next year. After all, he points out, these are people who are usually studying or working in other jobs and will return to them when, hopefully, the economy recovers.Whenever the lockdown is lifted, he expects it to be once more foreign labourers flying in to fill the void. And as with care home workers, delivery drivers and the whole invisible army of people that keep this country moving whose efforts have been drawn out of the shadows by Covid-19 - when they do he hopes that all of us regard their efforts with a renewed appreciation.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/13/12/bocelli.jpg","title":"andrea bocelli easter coronavirus milan concert duomo cathedral kim kardashian","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Kim Kardashian, Hugh Jackman and Kaley Cuoco are among the stars who have praised opera singer Andrea Bocelli’s moving Easter Sunday concert.The Italian tenor performed a show at\u0026nbspthe deserted Duomo cathedral in Milan on Sunday night (12 April).

But after the breakdown in relations with Russia in early March, it jacked up production to 11 million barrels a day.So some of those headline cuts merely offset the supply glut from the recent price war. There’s a formidable amount of black stuff in storage in ships and containers around the planet to get through.And then there’s the demand element of the equation to consider.The unprecedented lockdowns ordered by governments in response to the Covid-19 pandemic has seen global demand for energy plummet by around 30 per cent.Opec itself expected global oil demand to fall by 20 million barrels a day in April.That puts the 10 million barrels a day production cuts in the right context.As Bjornar Tonhaugen of Rystad\u0026nbspEnergy\u0026nbspputs it,\u0026nbspOpec has “only come up with half of the ransom money”.You can’t buck the market, as someone once said.Energy analysts are also doubtful about whether the production cuts will actually be delivered.Opec is not the cohesive force that it once was. The cartel has suffered from indiscipline internally. Can countries such as Iraq and Nigeria be relied on not to break ranks as their exchequers come under massive pressure in the coming months? And Opec allies are not necessarily reliable either, as the fiasco with Russia clearly demonstrates.“Trust, but verify” was the cautious view of the US towards Soviet nuclear disarmament pledges during the Cold War. Markets seem to be taking a similar attitude to production cuts now.And yet it’s possible to see something new emerging from the chaos of this price war, in particular the pressure successfully applied by Donald Trump to his Saudi allies and also Vladimir Putin’s Russia.The endorsement of the planned Opec cuts by G20 energy ministers last week and also the International Energy Agency, which was founded by industrialised countries in the 1970s to protect their fuel supplies, could also be significant.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe word is that large oil consumer nations including the US, India, China and Japan are preparing to boost their oil reserves in order to help support the global oil price – and non-Opec western states Norway and Canada have signalled a willingness to cut their own oil production volumes.Economists had expected the collapse in oil prices to exert deflationary pressure on the world economy. A deal to curb supply reduces some of that danger.These are early days, of course. But international coordination on oil production could be a significant legacy of this crisis. It’s far too early to talk about global recovery when we are still on the terrifying downward slope, but more a more stable energy market could help underpin it when it eventually arrives.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yes, we will have to wear masks, yes, there will have to be more physical distancing, yes, we must protect the vulnerable.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastAcknowledging the worldwide shortage of face masks, Dr Nabarro said they should first go to health workers as a priority, before they are given to people with coronavirus symptoms and those around them, and then people working in close contact with others, such as cashiers and hairdressers.“For the wider population, we probably won’t be able to ensure everybody quickly can access the good masks, the N95 masks, but then some form of facial protection I’m sure is going to become the norm – not least to give people reassurance,” he said.The WHO official added: “I don’t really like somebody in my role saying this is the advice, it’s up to national governments, but I think it will come because of what I’m calling being Covid-ready, learning to live with Covid.“It’s a revolution like when it was discovered that dirty water bore cholera in 1850, or like 25 years ago when we all learned about HIVAids\u0026nbspand its relationship with sex.“We changed and we adapted, we learned how to live with these new realities.”Dr\u0026nbspNabarro\u0026nbspsaid there would need to be evidence of the whole of society taking coronavirus symptoms seriously when they develop for the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspto be lifted.He said: “The most important thing to do is to isolate yourself when you have symptoms, and make sure all those with whom you’ve been in contact recently isolate themselves as well.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s all I would say, as someone with an enquiring mind.”Versions of the 5G conspiracy theory have been spreading online for years, with some proponents claiming the coronavirus outbreak is just the latest in a string of pandemics induced by\u0026nbspelectromagnetic waves.Created with Sketch.High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)The theory has been disproved countless times by scientists, with one microbiology professor recently describing it as\u0026nbsp”both a physical and biological impossibility”.That has not stopped the baseless claims being shared by high-profile figures such as actor Woody Harrelson and TV presenter Amanda Holden.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As though possessed by a collective mania, the residents of the Derbyshire town of Belper threw back their heads and began to moo like cattle…Though it sounds unlikely, this scene has become reality in lockdown Britain in 2020.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEvery afternoon at the allotted time, “hundreds” of people in Belper have broken the silence of the coronavirus\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspto channel the plaintive cries of incarcerated livestock.The bizarre ritual is the creation of local man Jasper Ward, who told BBC Radio 5 Live the bovine bellowing had made staying at home “a little bit more bearable”.“The crazy people of this town have taken to it like cows to grass,” he said.Created with Sketch.The 25 most remarkable animal pictures of the past decade Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.825 2010: A Marvel of Ants1125 2015: Tale of Two Foxes1425 2017: Pikin and Appolinaire1925 2017: Memorial to a Species2325 2018: Bed of Seals2425 2019: Land of the Eagle825 2010: A Marvel of Ants1125 2015: Tale of Two Foxes1425 2017: Pikin and Appolinaire1925 2017: Memorial to a Species2325 2018: Bed of Seals2425 2019: Land of the EagleMr Ward said he expected the project to last for a few days and would end with him being “ridiculed on social media”.Jaw-dropping video reveals supermarket workers using microphones\u0026nbspto announce that they are about to commence mooing, and inviting shoppers to join in.\u0026nbsp“We’re three weeks in and at six thirty there’s a chorus of moos,” said Mr Ward – who is now assuredly a hero in his hometown.A twitter page has even been created cataloguing the caterwauling citizens of Belper – many of whom are using additional rudimentary contrivances to amplify their guttural calls.\u0026nbspHow to eat healthily while in lockdownHow SNL’s at-home episode hit all the right notesHow socks became the unexpected fashion hero of lockdownAccording to the BBC, one resident, Isabel Kennedy, “has mooed since day one”.She told the broadcaster: “It’s a great way to get the community together – be part of something in these crazy and weird times. It’s the highlight of my day.”The last time Belper made international news was in 2001 after the town rejected the gift of a large fibreglass Mr Potato Head model from the US city of Pawtucket – which Belper is twinned with.At the time, Belper residents described the sculpture as “hideous”.

It’s great many of them will be able to do\u0026nbspsome of the things we normally associate with Easter, like enjoying chocolate, and our volunteers loved being able to add these to our deliveries.”The Felix Project has been ferrying over 20 tonnes of food each day to three of the huge community hubs established by London borough councils over the past two weeks – more than double the 10 tonnes a day it was supplying in normal times.In a bid to make the city-wide operation as efficient as possible, the charity has also forged an alliance with the two other big food surplus charities – FareShare and City Harvest – to create the London Food Alliance.“The food industry has really stepped up to help us – there’s been a brilliant response,” said CEO Mark\u0026nbspCurtin. “There’s still a huge amount of food coming from all our suppliers. And we’re doing everything we can to get that increased volume out where it’s needed.”The meal-kit company HelloFresh provides a regular supply of its surplus fruit and vegetables to the charity – and donated £25,000 to help the charity scale up its operations.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The pandemic has hit at cruel time for businesses who rely on themFor the first time in 800 years, the cathedral in Britain’s tiniest city will be empty this Easter Sunday.Several thousand visitors would have been expected to pour into St Davids Cathedral this weekend. Instead, the bishop of St Davids has invited them to pause at 10.30am on Sunday as she presides at the Easter Eucharist – from her kitchen.Because of coronavirus, several dozen of the small businesses in this seaside city in Pembrokeshire, west Wales, will also be losing out on visitors.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEaster, and the warmer weather it tends to bring, signals the awakening of the tourist season for hotspots across Britain.St Davids starts to see long lines form at beachside ice cream vans. Surfers hit the breaks on Whitesands Bay, tourists rent kayaks and coasteering guides, and\u0026nbspthen fill up on pasties called oggies before heading back to caravans and campsites.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastInstead, businesses have either sent staff home on furlough, reinvented themselves… or packed up.St Davids Cross Hotel, which has 16 rooms costing up to £145 a night, had been fully booked this weekend and most of next week. More than 100 guests have cancelled.“With the weather we’ve got down in Pembrokeshire at the moment, it’s been absolutely glorious for the last week and it’s going to be very nice next week,” says Alex Perkins, the hotel’s manager. “I suppose now we just hope that we’ll make it up in the summer or the winter.”Initially, the three-star hotel tried to adapt to the pandemic with takeaway food, and even put on a delivery Sunday roast service for Mother’s Day. But as time went on, the owners decided to completely shut and furlough the staff to reduce chances of transmitting the virus. “We’d rather people do stay at home than travel down to us,” Alex adds.Down the road, The Meadow cafe has made a slightly more unusual operational swerve. Co-owner Nick Michell has set up a health and fitness training service, offering one-to-one training through an app\u0026nbspand remote coaching.The 47-year-old says: “I was a personal trainer beforehand and I was intending to incorporate some of my services into what we do at the cafe, with a wellbeing offering.” Now that the cafe has closed, the fitness plans have been jolted into fruition.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would be extremely busy – Easter’s always a very busy time down here anyway because it’s the first of the big holidays after winter.”The farmhouse-style\u0026nbspcafe will benefit from the business rate relief, and the owners will take up the government’s offer to pay 80 per cent of the salary for the 10 furloughed staff. In the summer, another 10 workers are usually hired – a marker of the boom of the local economy in the tourist season. But the virus could wipe\u0026nbspout work for locals. St Davids has a population of around 1,600 but the city’s visitors reach into the hundreds of thousands throughout the year.As for business loans that are being made available by the Welsh government, Nick, who has an 18-month-old daughter, is not keen. “Loans are loans and you’ve got to pay them back,” he says. “With any new business, you invest significantly at the start. So we have already invested quite a lot anyway. We’re reluctant to refinance, to continue reinvesting with the unknown that is the future.”Unknown really is the word – the three-week lockdown marker is about to arrive, with no sign of an end yet in sight. And if we’re slowly eased out of paralysis, cafes, hotels and restaurants fear\u0026nbspmeasures will still restrict customers.The pandemic has hit at a cruel time. “We rely on from now until September to get probably 75 per cent of our income for the year,” Nick adds. His wife Emma, a yoga instructor, may soon be joining him in setting up remote classes.Back at the cathedral, Dean Sarah Rowland Jones still has high spirits. “We’ve got a community WhatsApp group, there’s stuff on Facebook, there’s a lot of people ringing each other up,” she says. “People are being particularly assiduous in looking out for one another. The rest of the year, the resident community is small. So in that sense, it’s quite easy to know who’s who and to watch out for everybody.”The locals who make up the congregation are also still able to join in by watching the cathedral’s YouTube videos, she adds.And at a time of uncertainty, at least they can be fairly sure that next year’s\u0026nbspEaster Sunday service won’t\u0026nbspbe held in the bishop’s\u0026nbspkitchen.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some 1.5 million people reported not eating for a whole day during the first three weeks of\u0026nbsplockdown, according to a\u0026nbspYouGov\u0026nbsppoll for The Food Foundation.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting\u0026nbspwork going on across the country to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak and is backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile several food banks have told us they have been forced to close their doors, many of them are attempting to switch gears and move into the home delivery of emergency food packages.Bassetlaw Food Bank in Nottinghamshire was forced to “temporarily suspend” normal\u0026nbspoperations at the beginning of April, after it lost more than two-thirds of its mainly older volunteers who are having to self-isolate or follow NHS shielding guidance.How to support our campaignAdministrator Mark\u0026nbspBagguley\u0026nbspis part of a skeleton team now working with\u0026nbspBassetlaw\u0026nbspCouncil Voluntary Service (BCVS) to make sure the most vulnerable people in the area get food parcels dropped at their door.“You just have to find a different way of doing things,” he said. “We’re trying to work others as best we can. It’s very difficult to say whether the local need is being met, now that everything has been thrown on its head. You just have to help as many people as you can.”Despite food donations left in supermarket collection points “dwindling significantly”, Mr Bagguley is making sure the produce gets taken to the BCVS’s central hub, where drivers deliver to people struggling with job losses, cuts in income or difficultly getting outside for health reasons.The Welcome Centre, an independent food bank in Huddersfield, has lost 50 per cent of its volunteers since the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspbegan. Yet demand for help has roughly doubled in the past few weeks.\u0026nbspKirklees\u0026nbspCouncil has sent two members of full-time staff to help the charity carry on by making home deliveries across the West Yorkshire town.“We normally help about 300 people in a month,” said Emma Greenough, one of The Welcome Centre’s managers. “It’s likely we’re helping around 600 people at the moment – although it’s guesswork at the moment because things are changing so fast.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the government could suspend the five-week wait for universal credit, it would be a big help to people.”Both the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest network of food banks, and the Independent Food Aid\u0026nbspNetwork (IFAN) are calling on the Department for Work and Pension to end the five week-wait on new claimants receiving their first universal credit payment.Ms\u0026nbspGoodwin said some of the independent food banks that closed a few weeks ago have already been able to re-emerge in a different form. “At the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak at least 12 of our member organisations closed. Since then, three of them have reopened because they have been able to adapt and put new processes in place.”The DENS Food Bank in Hemel Hempstead, part of the Trussell Trust network, is relying on extra help so it can continue to operate. Demand for food parcels has gone up 75 per cent in the past few weeks, at a time the food bank is struggling with a drop in volunteers. It has forged an alliance\u0026nbspwith another local charity called the South Hill Centre, allowing volunteer drivers to make home deliveries to people asking for help.“A lot of people have seen their income drop and they don’t have savings to cover them,” said Wendy Lewington, DENS Food Bank’s CEO. “For the self-employed, the government help that might be there in a couple of months isn’t there immediately so they’re struggling to afford the basics.”Both the Welcome Centre and DENS Decorum Food Bank are looking for financial donations and non-perishable items such as UHT milk, soups, tinned meat and fish – proving harder for many food banks to buy in bulk at the supermarkets.Despite the difficulties faced by small, local food banks, some of the larger food surplus charities – rescuing\u0026nbspunwanted or short-dated stock from restaurants, retailers and\u0026nbspmanufacturers\u0026nbsp– are stepping up to fill\u0026nbspsome of the gaps.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is supporting the work of our key partner The Felix Project – which has teamed with two other large organisations\u0026nbspin London to forge the London Food Alliance.The London Food Alliance is now coordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies, and also providing meals for\u0026nbspNHS staff.The Independent\u0026nbspis also encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The £1m you have donated will help us help The Felix Project feed NHS workers, care workers, the poor and the vulnerable. Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund. Felix is delivering to other homeless organisations, as well as The Marylebone Project, including Centrepoint.Des Scott, CEO of the Church Army, which runs The Marylebone Project and provides 112 beds to homeless women under the Edgware flyover, said: “Being able to get fresh vegetables is one of the key things we can do to keep these women healthy.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The only difference is that now I stand with my megaphone and shout, ‘Guys, please, two metres apart, you’re still going to get served, two metres apart, please.’”James Bardrick, head of Citi UK, said their donation to Help The Hungry\u0026nbspcomprised a combination of company money and an (as yet unknown) aggregation of employee donations which could conceivably exceed the £50,000 minimum pledged by the bank.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastHe added: “Our employees want to support those struggling.

And there are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence.Hostility with China is not going to help solve the coronavirus crisisTory rebels are right – Huawei is a threat to our national securityJohnson suffers revolt in Tory vote to end Huawei 5G involvement“Disrupting our involvement in the 5G rollout would do Britain a disservice.”Last month, the government hinted at future concessions to opponents of Huawei’s involvement in rolling out the ultrafast wireless technology when a minister said 36 Tory MPs who refused to vote in line with the leadership had been heard “loud and clear”.The rebels fear Huawei is effectively a front for the Chinese state – putting the UK’s security at risk – and want it ripped out of the 5G network by the end of 2022.But in his letter, Mr Zhang highlighted Huawei’s already extensive role in Britain’s data network, and said the firm was “focused on keeping Britain connected” during the “unprecedented” coronavirus pandemic.Created with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanHe said data usage had increased by at least 50 per cent since Covid-19 first reached the UK, placing “significant pressure” on telecoms systems.“That’s why reliable mobile and broadband networks are crucial.

A Westminster Magistrates’ Court judge rejected calls for an adjournment until September over what his legal team said were “insuperable” difficulties preparing his case due to the Covid-19 pandemic.In the preliminary hearings, Mr Assange’s lawyers claimed Donald Trump had offered to pardon him if he said that Russia was not involved in a leak of Democratic party emails ahead of the 2016 US election.Former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called the allegations\u0026nbsp“ a complete fabrication”, adding:\u0026nbsp”This is probably another never-ending hoax and total lie from the DNC.”Campaigners and friends have warned of\u0026nbspMr Assange’s deteriorating health for some time.His father, John Shipton, recently told the BBC that an extradition to the US would be akin to “a death sentence”.Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some people will even tell you that the locusts are more destructive than the coronavirus. There are even some who don’t believe that the virus will reach here.”Some farmers in Mr Abokat’s village near the Kenyan border bang metal pans, whistle or throw stones to try to drive the locusts away. But mostly they watch in frustration, largely barred by a coronavirus lockdown from gathering outside their homes.A failed garden of cassava, a local staple, means hunger. Such worries in the village of some 600 people are reflected across a large part of East Africa, including Kenya, Ethiopia and South Sudan. The locust swarms also have been sighted in Djibouti, Eritrea, Tanzania and Congo.The UN\u0026nbspFood and Agriculture Organisation\u0026nbsp(FAO) has called the locust outbreak, caused in part by climate change, “an unprecedented threat” to food security and livelihoods. Its officials have called this new wave some 20 times the size of the first.Army of 100,000 ducks deployed to combat locust infestationLocust swarms cross into hunger-hit South Sudan‘Catastrophe’: Biggest locust swarm in decades triggers dire warning“The current situation in East Africa remains extremely alarming as ... an increasing number of new swarms are forming in Kenya, southern Ethiopia and Somalia,” a new FAO assessment said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So far the FAO has collected $111m\u0026nbspin cash or pledges.The locusts are “invading the Eastern Africa region in exceptionally large swarms like never seen before”,\u0026nbspthe Nairobi-based Climate Prediction and Application Centre said.The new swarms include “young adults”,\u0026nbspvoracious bugs “that eat more than the adult ones”,\u0026nbspsaid Kenneth Mwangi, a satellite information analyst at the centre.Mr Mwangi and other officials in Kenya cited difficulties in fighting the infestation as coronavirus-related travel restrictions slow cross-border travel and delay the delivery of pesticides.The verification work of field officers has been curtailed, making it harder for the centre to update regional prediction models, Mr Mwangi said.In rural Laikipia county, among the worst affected in Kenya, some are calling attention to the threat to commercial farms.“I think, unfortunately, because of other things going on around the world, people are forgetting about the problem with the locusts. But it’s a very, very real problem,” farmer George Dodds told the FAO.Aerial spraying is the only effective way to control the locust outbreak. After the locusts crossed into Uganda for the first time since the 1960s, soldiers resorted to using hand-held spray pumps because of difficulties in obtaining the needed aircraft.Uganda’s agriculture minister said authorities are unable to import enough pesticides from Japan, citing disruptions to international cargo shipments.The government is yet to meet an additional budget of over $4m requested for locust control, the minister said.The sum is substantial in a country where the president has been fundraising from wealthy people to help respond to the virus and its economic disruption. Health workers are threatening to strike over lack of protective gear.In Ethiopia, where some 6 million people live in areas affected by the locust outbreak, the infestation if unchecked “will cause large-scale crop, pasture and forest-cover loss, worsening food and feed insecurity”,\u0026nbspthe FAO says.Bands of immature locusts are forming in areas that include the country’s breadbasket, the Rift Valley region, it said.Ethiopia’s agriculture minister has said efforts are under way to deploy six helicopters against the infestation that could last until late August.But ministry spokesman Moges Hailu spoke of an ominous sign: the locust swarms are now appearing in locations where they had not been previously sighted.Additional reporting by APShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 FebruaryHe added: “The worst crime he committed, in the eyes of the establishment, is not the policy he’s proposing it’s the fact that he was able to inspire popular movements, which had already been developing — Occupy, Black Lives Matter, many others — and turn them into an activist movement, which doesn’t just show up every couple years to push a leader and then go home, but applies constant pressure, constant activism and so on.”Many commentators have pointed out that because of Mr Sanders’s success and the way he especially inspired young voters – he won the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada – visually every Democratic candidate was obliged to have their own policies on topics such as climate change, greater accessibly to healthcare, and criminal justice reform.As it, Mr Sanders has said his name will remain on the ballot in the primaries remaining and he will continue to collect and accrue. He said this was a deliberate tactic to try and put pressure on the committee that agrees the party’s official policy platform this summer.Mr Chomsky said if Donald Trump\u0026nbspwere elected it would be an “indescribable disaster”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I just mentioned the Lancet figures. It will get worse. What this means for the environment or the threat of nuclear war, which no one is talking about but is extremely serious, is indescribable.”He said he assumed a Biden presidency would be a continuation of former president Barack Obama’s administration “nothing very great, but at least not totally destructive, and opportunities for an organised public to change what is being done, to impose pressures”.Israel intervention in US election greater than Russia’s, says ChomskyNoam Chomsky says antifa is gift to far right and US state repressionChomsky says Trump brought Doomsday Clock alarmingly close to midnightNoam Chomsky argues Antifa is a ‘major gift to the right’He said if Mr Biden, 77, were elected Mr Sanders and his supporters could continue to seek to put that pressure on him.Aware that he will need the backing and votes on Mr Sanders’s supporters if he is to defeat Mr Trump in November, Mr Biden immediately paid tribute to the senator after he suspended his campaign. In a statement directed at those who had so vigorously supported the veteran democratic socialist, he also said: “I see you, I hear you.”On Thursday, in what was seen as another nod to the progressives he need to win over, he unveiled two new proposals he said would help ease the “economic burden on working people”.These were a proposed lowering of the age eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 60 and eliminating student debt for some lower-income families.“In our nation’s 244 years, we have never weathered a crisis that we did not emerge from stronger,” Mr Biden wrote. “This one will be no different.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The sign that adorned the entrance of the market, a landmark of Wuhan city, has also been removed.As residents prepare for a return to work this week, business owners at the market will have nowhere to go. “Since all businesses need to apply for permission from the government before they restart operation, it will be impossible for these businesses to gain the government’s approval,” said Michael, who used to own a fruit stand a few blocks away from the Huanan Seafood Market and refused to give his real name.Wildlife trade was once a lucrative and thriving industry in China, but the suspicion that the current coronavirus pandemic started in\u0026nbspexotic animals smuggled into the country has forced the government to crack down on the decades-old trade.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast month, Beijing rolled out a strict ban on the breeding and consumption of wild animals, as it tried to prevent another outbreak from happening. This was a general guidance issued from the central government, with the power to enforce the law ultimately lying with provincial or municipal officials.Several other provinces have followed suit, and the southern industrial hub Shenzhen announced a ban on the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat on Thursday, becoming the first Chinese city to do so.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIn Wuhan, local officials have been increasingly strict in their crackdown on businesses engaged in wildlife trade or breeding. On 3 March, local authorities in Wuhan carried out a comprehensive disinfection campaign across the entire Huanan Seafood Market.However, recent reports suggest that despite the regional governments\u0027\u0026nbspefforts to put an end to wildlife trade, illicit commercial activities are still happening at public markets in certain parts of China. Earlier this week, the Mail on Sunday reported that thousands of customers flooded an indoor market in the southwestern city of Guilin in China, as living dogs and cats were crammed into cages while dead bats and scorpions were on display.Andrew Huang, a Chinese culinary expert, says one of the reasons why it’s hard for the Chinese government to completely end the consumption and trading of wildlife in China is because such behaviours have become part of decades-olds tradition in the country.“Different parts of China have their specific traditions of consuming wildlife for different purposes,” Mr Huang explains. “In the northeastern part of China, bears and deers are a big part of the local delicacies while in southwestern China, bats and pangolins are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The steady demand for such wildlife has nurtured a lucrative supply chain, including some businesses that focus on breeding specific types of wild animals.”Mr Huang thinks that the current crackdown on wildlife trade and consumption might temporarily prevent relevant practices from happening in public markets, but it will be hard to completely eliminate it from the Chinese culture.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“In the short term, even if wildlife sellers can’t keep selling these animals in public, they will try to find other ways to keep the businesses alive,” Mr Huang tells The Independent. “As the old saying goes, life will always find a way. Even if the government has banned wildlife trade and consumption, the tradition won’t be so easily wiped out.”‘No need to close the entire market’In Wuhan, while the plan to shut down the Huanan Seafood Market is underway, local residents have different opinions about how to handle the market where the coronavirus pandemic began.“Honestly, wildlife trade isn’t the main commercial activity at the Hunan Seafood Market, as most of the sellers still focus on selling different kinds of seafood,” says Ms Xu, who was a frequent shopper at the market until it was shut down.Since the market is right next to one of the major train stations in the city, she says, it has become the regional hub for selling fruits and seafood, as well as wildlife. Due to the large number of visitors coming from different parts of Hubei province, it also became the ideal breeding ground for the coronavirus.“I think even if the government wants to ban wildlife trade, they don’t have to shut down the entire seafood market,” Ms Xu says. “This will have a huge impact on local restaurants and businesses that have long relied on the market for their seafood supplies.”Ms Xu says that instead of forcing dozens of business owners to lose their livelihoods, the Chinese government should focus more on tackling the ongoing pandemic itself. “I wish the government could conduct more coronavirus tests on citizens, because I suspect many of them could still be asymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

our schools is one of the key issues the nation will face when it steps carefully away from this Covid- lockdown.Based on the evidence, I believe that re-opening schools should be considered early in the exit strategy because it appears they play a relatively small role in transmissions.We tend to see children as excellent spreaders of bugs, and therefore ­closing schools seems to make sense.Yet research published earlier this week shows that this isn’t necessarily true for the Covid- virus.Almost everything we know about closing schools to stop disease outbreaks comes from influenza.Flu is a very dferent virus to coronavirus, and children drive much of influenza’s transmission.Coronavirus is less likely to affect children and young people.They rarely get very sick, and they mostly get very mild symptoms or show no ­symptoms at all.During the  epidemic caused by Sars — a cousin of Covid- — the data showed that schools and schoolchildren played no role in transmitting the virus.To

getting some online teaching  —  my -year-old had brilliant support from his school before the holidays.But we know that some schools are offering much less, and I worry that it is particularly the poorest children who are ­missing out.Children also benefit from school through contact with friends and adults outside their family.Plus there is support for mental health and even in the food that they might not get at home.School closures also force children together with parents at home for weeks on end.This can be a source of great bonding, but we know that, particularly for teens, being cut off from peer groups and other adults is not good for their development or mental health.The issue of forcing key worker parents to stay home has been largely solved during the pandemic by keeping some schools open just for their ­children.But for parents who are not key workers, being forced to look after ­children for weeks at home can prevent them earning an income.Closing schools has in the past been shown to increase social contacts between children outside school, and between children and adults looking after them, particularly grandparents, who are most vulnerable to this virus.Currently, those over  should be self- isolating away from children.But there are many grandparents who are under .Andschools stay closed while we allow adults to exit lockdown first, we risk an increase in contact between children and grandparents.One of the problems is that we tend to think of schools as being entirely closed or open.Our research showed that there are a range of potential options.It would mean a partial or staged re-opening with social distancing built in.The point of social distancing for schools is to reduce the number of children in contact at any one time.Ensuring that dferent school years don’t meet would be a useful start.So have half the school attend in the morning and half in the afternoon, close the playgrounds and stagger year-group start, end and break times so that ­dferent years never meet.Then ensure that dferent classes don’t meet.This could mean staggering start times by class or alternating the ways that classes enter and leave school, and ­keeping students in form classes for all their lessons.Schools could also look at how feasible social distancing is within classes.True, most British classrooms could not fit a metre between desks.However,only half of the school is attending at any one time, classes could spread out across more than one classroom.We also need very clear rules on when not to come to school with any ­symptoms, and the need for self-isolation at homeothers in the family had been ill will be required.Teachers need to be protected, as we protect those who ­continue to drive buses, man shopping centres and work in our health ­system.And teachers should be early in the queue for testing.This may all sound too dficult.However, we owe it to our ­children to examine all of these options.It could be done more easilywe had sufficient testing to know which children or teachers had had Covid-.But we may need to proceed ­without that, given what we are currently told about antibody-testing timescales.As mentioned, our schools are already ­partially open — for the children of key workers and vulnerable children.Let’s gradually increase that “partially” in a way that’s guided by science.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the bus drivers — nine already dead in London alone from Covid-. And the pharmacists filling out prescriptions in tiny, windowless shops.And the postmen, delivery drivers, papergirls — and anonymous neighbours who put notes through doors offering help for the vulnerable.And the supermarket workers who stack the shelves to keep our nation fed. And a round of applause for our Queen,  this month, who gave the speech of a letime last Sunday — and for our Prime Minister who ended up in intensive care.From the bin men to Boris, we are surrounded by heroes — but the one glaring exception has been elite football.Despite inidual acts of heroism, such as Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford raising £million for underprivileged schoolkids, football has not covered itself in glory during this national emergency.On Wednesday, Premier League captains announced they were banding together to create a fund to raise millions for the NHS.This is a big-hearted gesture but can’t hide the fact that for much of this health crisis the national game has been hopelessly out of touch with the national mood.When the Prime Minister was seriously ill, it made the skin crawl to see whining millionaire footballers resisting pay cuts from clubs that have nothing to sell, no revenue coming in and no idea when football will begin again.Gordon Taylor, the £million-a-year chief of the Professional Footballers Association, has made his members about as popular as bankers.While the country fights for its le, Taylor has fought for the rights of loafing footballers to keep every last million. He has badly misjudged the moment, as have the clubs owned by billionaires who have furloughed their tea ladies while pampered footballers continue to earn up to £, a week.It has been embarrassing to see hypocritical footballers mistaking “lockdown” for “lock-in”, acting like the new rules do not apply to them.After previously urging fans to stay at home, Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish emerged bleary-eyed from an all-night party and pranged his -grand Range Rover.Manchester City’s Kyle Walker had a couple of escort girls delivered to his door, soon before telling the peasants to social distance and save lives and blah-blah-blah. All that stuff about washing your hands, Kyle — should that be before or after the escorts have been round And Spurs manager Jose Mourinho oversaw a training session on Hadley Common, for all the world asthere was one rule for the princes of football and one for the plebs who pay their wages.Do the fatheads of football ever watch the news Mass unemployment is coming. Many of the millions about to be chucked on the dole will be football fans. So how the hell can football — the players, clubs, PFA — continue to kid themselves the bubble they exist in has not already burst The world has changed.There should be no more all-night parties, no more escort girls and no more car prangs. Like it or not, footballers are role models and many will follow their lead.Troy Deeney, Watford captain and one of the prime movers behind the Players Together fund, defends Jack Grealish’s busy social le during the time of lockdown. “What’s he going to do ” Troy asked. “Sit in the yard on his own ”Yes, Troy — because that’s what millions are doing right now. Shocking, I know, but the new rules apply to footballers, too.Most footballers come from working-class backgrounds but too many of them have a sense of entitlement worthy of Marie Antoinette.Look what happened to her.NEVER going out is placing an unbearable strain on relationships.So it is nice to see that Camila Morrone, , and Leonardo DiCaprio, , seem to be happily self-isolating together.I was afraid Leo might decide Camila’s just too old for him.STEVE HEDLEY, rail union fat cat at the RMT, boasts that he would “throw a party”Boris Johnson died of coronavirus – and hopes “the whole Cabinet of Tory b******s” also become victims.If Hedley was on a ventilator fighting for his le, would he check how the doctors and nurses caring for him voted at the last election You don’t think those NHS heroes all voted Labour, do you, Steve WILLIAM and Kate carried out their first virtual royal duty this week, thanking teaching staff who look after the children of key workers.I have never seen smiles that wide on the faces of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.I am sure that, deep down inside, they are really missing Harry and Meghan.They are just covering it up really well.FAREWELL Honor Blackman, who has died at the age of , immortal for ever in her career-defining role as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger.It is funny how certain names fall out of favour.At school I had mates called Keith and Ian, but nobody is called Keith or Ian today.Same thing with Pussy Galore. Bond girls just don’t get called things like Pussy Galore any more.THIS lockdown is taking an enormous toll on jobs, education and mental health but most of us understand it is necessary.I am infuriated, though, by the constant threats to intensy the lockdown, including closing the parks,a handful of idiots continue to flout the rules.Health Secretary Matt Hancock rages that he finds it “unbelievable that people are not staying at home” – and threatens to ban all exercise.Personally, I find it unbelievable that Hancock makes threats like some little home counties Hitler.Give credit to the MILLIONS who are doing their best during the lockdown.Don’t threaten the decent majority with a punishment beating because a selfish minority break the rules.If this Government ramps up the lockdown they will lose the British people. And something will explode.If some morons can’t stick to the rules, punish THEM – not the rest of us.KILLING EVE lost its way when the show’s creator Phoebe “Fleabag” Waller-Bridge bailed out after the first series. The second series was painfully naff.Early reports on the third series, starting tomorrow on BBC iPlayer, are not promising.But Jodie Comer as Russian assassin Villanelle will always make you want to tune in. Evenit is just for her new outfits.THIS global catastrophe started in China.When the dead are buried and we stand among our ruined economies, there MUST be some kind of reckoning.After World War Two, the Potsdam Conference decided that Germany should pay billion for what Germany had inflicted on humanity.China is now boasting that le is back to normal there, while we are burying NHS nurses like Rebecca Mack, , who worked in a children’s cancer unit. She has been hailed as a “wonderful daughter” by her heartbroken parents.Coronavirus was not an act of God. It started in China.A study by  senior Tories concludes that the UK should pursue China through international courts for £billion in coronavirus compensation.Germany paid for starting the war. Why shouldn’t China pay for coronavirus GREAT news that Boris is out of intensive care and on the way to recovery.But when he emerges from that ICU, he must give himself all the time it takes to fully recover.And then Boris has to lose weight. I saw David Cameron describe Boris as “very fit”.Sorry – a -year-old man who weighs over st is emphatically not “very fit”.He is a serious illness – a heart attack, stroke or diabetes – waiting to happen.I know from having Boris as my neighbour for years that he loves his jogging and cycling. But please slim down, Boris.Carrie and your unborn child need you. So does Dilyn the dog. So does your country.Because Boris Johnson’s great genius is for giving people HOPE.God knows we need some of that right now. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a magnicent address, from a magnicent woman.Her experience and serenity did more to calm and inspire the nation than anything  I can think of as this crisis has unfolded.Best of all, she reminded us that there will be le beyond this lockdown — that we will meet again.If we just focus on the here and now, we won’t be able to prepare for the future beyond the virus.But it’s also true that none of us can think straight when we are in the eye of the storm.That is where good leadership comes in. It helps us all to hold strong, not to go to pieces and to stick to the guidance given to us.Everyone looks to the leader to make decisions, and it’s the decisions we make that will chart our way out of the crisis.Unfortunately, after the Queen’s address to the nation came the news that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been admitted to hospital intensive care.At that point, anyone who was in any doubt this illness did not discriminate was forced to reconsider.At the time of writing, Boris was back on a regular hospital ward. But his illness has been a reminder that any of us are susceptible to Covid-.Most people are shocked he is in hospital and sympathise with his pregnant girlfriend Carrie Symonds.But of course it has raised the question: Who is really in chargehe is not  Without leadership, we all get distinctly uneasy.We all have leaders in our lives. We are all looking towards them to show us what to do and lead us through it.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealSome companies have stepped up to the plate and are doing good things — reassuring their staff, treating people well and doing their utmost to make sure people will be paid. Some aren’t, of course. But good bosses are taking pay cuts and doing everything they can to keep their businesses alive and look after their staff.At West Ham United we continue to pay all our full and part-time staff  per cent of their wages.My financial director, my manager and I have all taken a  per cent reduction to make sure this happens.It’s when there’s a crisis like this that we see who is made of what.Boris’s temporary stand-in, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, while talking about the PM’s hospital admission, referred to him as his boss, his colleague, but also his friend.Respect and friendship are the key words when it comes to good leadership.A good leader makes the tough decisions because they are right, but they are also governed by ethics. They want to do the right thing, for the right reasons. They are happy to make personal sacrices to ensure the majority are looked after.It is more important now, than ever, to put people before profits.After three weeks of lockdown, with no chance of a let-up, it’s all too easy to fall prey to catastrophic, even apocalyptic thinking.But we have to sht our thought process. We have to accept and understand that, at some point, this WILL be over.When things are calmer and clearer, we can ask what we can do to ensure we are still operating as the world gets back to normal — whatever the new normal is.The experience we are all living through really is like a storm, which continues to rage.There are so many unprecedented aspects to this situation and there is not one person in the world who will come out of it unchanged.So while there are so many challenging and dficult things going on, perhaps this lockdown is a chance for us all to learn more about ourselves.How are you responding  Have you thought about how you can help others  Have you thought about volunteering for the NHS As well as the importance of good leadership, we all have our inidual roles when it comes to showing autonomy and courage about our own decisions.I’m sorry to say, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.So we all need to take responsibility — or we will never get out of lockdown.ANYONE who saw the social media video of Naomi Watts reaching breaking point after her printer, vacuum cleaner and dishwasher all broke down will surely have smiled in recognition.Naomi, who has been self-isolating in her Los Angeles home for three weeks, shared her very understandable anguish with a slow-motion video of herself screaming with the sound of a lion’s roar played in the background.I think we can all relate to her frustration.My lockdown revelation I am happy to report that I have given up ironing!WHEN it comes to illness, particularly cancer, I’ve long resisted all the talk of going into battle – mainly because of the unhelpful implication of weakness among those who “lose” that fight by dying.I feel the same way about descriptions of people “fighting” coronavirus.Illness is a fact of le. It is not a sign of weakness.The sad and terrible truth is that some people get this virus and others do not.Some have it very badly – a whole lot worse than others.We don’t yet know exactly why. We don’t even knowwe have the virus and may infect people.We don’t knowthere are antibodies that can protect us from getting it again, or how long that will take.We don’t knowthere will be a more deadly mutation of the same virus in the future.There is just too much we don’t know.But there are some practical things we can do.We need to help those who have it now, and the NHS and the Government are doing all they can in this regard.We also need to stop the spread of the virus, through testing. Hopefully that is going to happen soon.Meanwhile, scientists are also working around the clock to create a vaccine.Perhaps, most of all, we need to prepare for the possibility that this could all happen again.We need to learn lessons on food distribution, working from home, adapting our businesses – and having proper personal protection and hospital equipment ready and waiting.AS time ticks on, we are all realising what le is like without the things we used to consider necessities.Like our hairdressers.Claudia Winkleman’s Instagram post showing how unmanageable her fringe has become during lockdown made me laugh in recognition.My hair is grey, long and unkempt.On the one hand, it’s the least of my worries, which is quite liberating.Still, I did manage to get my hands on some hair dye for the roots.Do I care that it’s completely the wrong shade NO. I do not.So please, can we all just agree to turn a blind eye to the way we look when we finally emerge from lockdown HAPPY Easter Sunday, people. How will you be spending yours Personally, I have lost track of what day it is. The past few weeks have been a blur, with every day feeling like a cross between Sunday and Monday.It was my birthday last week and, without loved ones to hug, friends to see, drinks to be had, it was more or less just another day.Equally, this is the first time ever that Easter has felt like just another weekend.But I hope you can find ways to make it special. Just make sure you do so at home.THERE has been talk of schools possibly reopening after the Easter holidays – and who knows whether or not that is true But one thing I do know is that, whenever they do reopen, working parents will not only give the most massive sigh of relief, they will all be thanking their children’s teachers profusely for everything that they do.We will all also be thanking doctors, nurses, all NHS employees, as well as bin men, cleaners, shop assistants and all the other key workers we have under-paid and taken for granted.I really hope that is one thing which changes as a result of this pandemic.These people are the backbone of our country.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One says that restrictions should be lted sooner rather than later to reboot our ecomony, while the other argues that the restrictions are working, so now is not the right time to lt them.When Chancellor Rishi Sunak first announced his bail-out plan last month, it was estimated that ten to  per cent of workers in the ­private sector would need Government support.Now economic forecasters believe it could be a third of the total private sector workforce. That will cost the British taxpayer between £billion and £billion every three months.To date, about a fth of small businesses have been pushed into bankruptcy. If the lockdown continues to July, that figure will rise to a third.The effect of this on the economy will be catastrophic. According to the ­Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Britain’s GDP could contract by  per cent over the next two years. It shrank by six per cent during the global financial crisis of -.The Centre for Economics and Business Researchsays the lockdown is costing £.billion a day.Given we are now  days into the lockdown, this means we are already more than £billlion out of pocket.In short,we don’t ease off on the social distancing measures and re-boot the economy, we’re heading for the biggest economic downturn since the s.Against this, we are told thatwe end the lockdown more people will become infected, demand for critical hospital care will outstrip the NHS’s capacity and we’ll begin to see people dying in even greater numbers.I’m sceptical about that prognosis.It is based on the statistical modelling of Professor Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College, but there is mounting evidence that they under-estimated the percentage of the population already infected with coronavirus and over-estimated how deadly this disease is.According to Prof Ferguson’s model, fewer than five per cent of people have been infected. But according to another model, this one produced by Oxford University, it could be higher than  per cent, which would mean we are on our way to acquiring herd immunity.When Chris Whitty, England’s Chief Medical Officer, was asked at Thursday’s press conference what percentage of the world’s population has been infected, he put the figure at  per cent.If the true figure is between  and  per cent, the NHS can probably copewe ease off on some of the more extreme social distancing measures.Would ending the lockdown be ­gambling with people’s lives  Yes, but so will keeping it in place.Economic downturns cost lives, just as surely as viruses. During the global financial crisis of –, the suicide rate in Europe increased by . per cent. Economic recessions also cause a rise in poverty, domestic ­violence and murder.Philip Thomas, professor of risk ­management at Bristol University, has calculated thatour GDP falls by more than . per cent as a result of the lockdown, more years of le will be lost than saved.Politicians here and where have justied their cautious approach by ­saying they refuse to put a price on human le, as though the trade-off is between the lives of vulnerable people and economic growth.But the real trade-off is between the lives we might losewe end the ­lockdown tomorrow and the lives we know we will losewe keep it in place indefinitely.MPs aren’t being morally ­courageous. Rather, they’re just focusing on the next -hour news cycle, as they always do.What’s needed is a bold political leader who’s willing to risk some short-term pain to re-start the economy, thereby safeguarding all of our futures.I know of just such a person, but unfortunately he’s in hospital recovering from coronavirus.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe UK government’s measures to contain the coronavirus epidemic are just starting to make a ­dference.And with the three-week lockdown under review tomorrow, now is NOT the time to lt them.After a slow and indecisive start, the measures they now have put in place, including recommendations to stay at home, limiting travel, physical ­distancing, banning large gatherings and shutting shops and pubs, are just starting to show signs that they are slowing the spread of the virus.This means that there are fewer new cases, with fewer people becoming seriously sick and less demand on hospital beds, intensive care and articial ventilation.This means that the pressure on health services is reduced, which, in turn, will lead to fewer deaths from Covid- and other causes.Without the actions that have been taken and just letting the epidemic run its course, we would be likely to see more than half the population infected, and an overwhelmed health system with maybe five million hospital admissions and at least , deaths.The measures that have been taken in the UK have been of moderate strength compared to other countries.In France and Spain, the lockdown has been more severe, while in Sweden it has been less strict.The coronavirus epidemic can be thought of like a fire.If we starve a fire of oxygen, then the flames will stop and it will die down.So it is with the epidemic — reduce transmission from person to person and the number of cases will go down.Butyou let the oxygen come back too early, any embers in the fire will light up again and it will restart.So,we relax the lockdown too early, while there is still transmission of the virus going on, then the epidemic will restart.And that means that we would have wasted the efforts we have made so far.When transmission has stopped, or is at low enough levels that it can be monitored and each case and their contacts identied, isolated and treated, then the lockdown can be relaxed.We have not yet reached the peak of the epidemic, and we do not yet have the infrastructure in place for the systematic testing that will be needed to identy new cases, so now is not the time to relax the lockdown measures.Some people have talked about the serious damage done to the economy by measures the Government has put in place and the social disruption these have caused, in order to protect the public health of the nation.They have argued the lockdown will cause more harm than good in the long term. This is a  dilemma.Every le matters. Each person lost is a family member, a friend, a neighbour, a human being.They are not a number on a spreadsheet.This lockdown is the only way for us to get back on our feet.If left uncontrolled, the coronavirus by itself will cause social and economic disruption as well as damaging public health.It doesn’t need any help from politicians.It is up to us all, for the sake of ourselves, our families and our loved ones, to follow the rules, and our solidarity will allow the country totowards normal as soon as possible.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The true figure could be ten times as high — or more.This, remember, is the regime that still lies about the thousands slaughtered in the  Tiananmen Square massacre.Yet China, having destroyed lives and livelihoods around the globe, is emerging as the big winner from its own pandemic.Like vultures hovering over roadkill, leaders of the world’s second-biggest economy are eyeing up the casualties of this made in-China calamity.Covid- risks opening the door to Beijing’s dominance over world trade and commerce, at unimaginable cost to our freedoms and democracy.Rattled world leaders, from Australia to Germany, are drafting emergency laws to prevent China mopping up crown jewels in pharmaceuticals, minerals, articial intelligence and robot technology.But it is probably too late. The West has turned a blind eye to China’s decades of industrial espionage and its cut-price grab for market share.Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is utterly dependent on cheap, heavily subsidised Chinese components and the VW and Mercedes car sales that account for a third of their profits.Suicidally, it will see Chinese cash as a passport out of the crisis.“We have grown too idle and too comfortable to want to do the things the Chinese do for us,” says a Cabinet insider.The world stood silent as China’s Belt And Road programme gobbled up key ports and industries, rare earth minerals and rich farmland across Africa and the Third World.Beijing is now rubbing its hands at the prospect of fresh bargains.Household-name firms here and in Europe are struggling to survive the lockdown. Some will never reopen their doors.The best might end up in Beijing at fire-sale prices.China has already seized a big stake in the UK with its richly subsidised £billion contract for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset.Telecoms giant Huawei has its sticky fingers all over our sensitive G superhighway — a decision which must now surely be reversed.The image of communist China as a civilised equal partner is a dangerous fantasy.“China is not and never will be our friend,” a senior minister warns. “But it is the only one with ready cash and all our markets have collapsed because of something China started.“Our economy is being shattered and it is their fault. The idea of selling them some of our best companies is horrying.”China’s own economy has been hammered too. But it remains a ruthless totalitarian state which brooks no opposition.The brutal incarceration of a million Uighur Muslims in “re-education” camps is a blot on the civilised world. So is the trade in human organs from executed prisoners.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealWho will stop China becoming the world’s dominant power It will be hard for our liberal elite to swallow, but the only answer is Donald Trump.The American President has already cracked down on China’s trade and currency cheating. Democrat rival Joe Biden — backed by peace-at-any-price Barack Obama — would kowtow to Beijing.At this pivotal moment in world history, it is reassuring to know President Trump has a high regard for our Prime Minister.Once Boris is back on his feet and coronavirus begins to fade, he must join forces with the world’s greatest superpower and address the smiling menace of Chinese President Xi Jinping.As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.Boris was hardest hit, followed by chief of staff Dominic Cummings, who is only now ing to work after a fortnight in bed.A dozen others, including Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and No Press chief Lee Cain, went down like skittles.So who was the super-spreader The finger of suspicion is pointed at health supremo Matt Hancock, first in and energetically first out of self- isolation. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Weaposre sorryyou think the data we release is next to useless, but please be assured it is the most useful data we have.Weaposre sorryyou feel that not telling you how many medics and carers have died with coronavirus because that was inappropriate at that time, in some way contradicted the fact we told you exactly which films Boris Johnson was watching on his iPad while in hospital.

There are many iables between nations, and such comparisons are not always entirely fair.If you feel that herds in other countries were treated like grown-ups, and acted like grown-ups, and that those countries are doing rather better with this bug than our own, then all we can say is that treating people as a herd is not the policy of this government at this time.

Some PPE from China has been rejected due to our very stringent checks, because nothing is more important than protecting the NHS and saving lives.Iaposm sorryyou feel we have not done that. Weaposre sorryyou feel that previous governments capped the wages of NHS staff in an effective pay cut, that in  many of those now running this government ignored a pandemic practice exercise which highlighted some of the problems weaposre now facing, or that in some way we spent more time forcing junior doctors out on strike than on resolving their concerns.Let me assure you we are doing everything in our power to flatten the curve in the opinion polls, which was ing before lockdown and is now shooting up because the herd is desperate to think the country is being led by those who know what theyaposre doing.The last thing we want is for anyone to remember that Winston Churchill was one of our most popular leaders ever, yet was trounced by the electorate the first chance it got.

The Scottish First Minister admitted today that the UK governmentaposs review expected on Thursday will inevitably see an extension of the lockdown. The UK has entered a fourth week of lockdown as the battle against coronavirus intensies. Parts of Europe have seen restrictions relaxed after a drop off in cases as hopes were rising that a similar decision could be made here. But it now seems certain that Britain will not follow suit after the death toll surpassed ,. An announcement on the next step is expected to be made by the UK government this week, probably on Thursday. But Ms Sturgeon has all but confirmed there will be no positive lockdown news coming in the week ahead. She said: There is of course due to be a review of these restrictions this week. I want to today be very clear so that nobody is under any illusion.  That review is not likely to result in these restrictions being lted in the very near future.

The lionising of a Prime Minister thankfully released from hospital only adds insult to the terrible injury endured by families mourning lost loved ones. Deputising Dominic Raab boasting his boss is “a fighter” was grotesquely insensitive: thousands of husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters didn’t perish from lack of courage yet some almost certainly died who could’ve been saved. Justice and maintaining le demands we scrutinise Johnson’s errors, Britain’s toll of , deaths in hospitals alone a loss far greater than Germany’s under , in a larger population despite the coronavirus infecting both countries around the same moment. The warning from one of the Government’s most senior scientic advisers, Jeremy Farrar, that the UK’s likely to be among the European nations hit hardest, possibly even the worst, surpassing Italy, France and Spain, is a brutal condemnation of a PM slow to act. Failing to prioritise tests, masks and ventilators cost lives, probably including NHS workers. Johnson’s boast at the beginning on March  he was shaking hands with everyone in a hospital, lying it had coronavirus patients, was the blasé recklessness of a politician more worried a lockdown might damage his popularity than doing what was right.

The tot underwent open heart surgery and endured problems with her windpipe but after months of treatment she stood a good chance of recovery.However, last Friday, she was confirmed as having the killer bug and be treated at Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital in Liverpool, Mail Online reports.She is on a Continuous Positive Airway Pressuremachine that supplies her with oxygen with her -year-old mum Emma Bates with her side.  For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here Only one parent can stay with her so her dad Wayne, , is self-isolating at the family home in Bury, Greater Manchester, because of the contact he has had with his poorly daughter. The couple are keeping in contact by phone calls and regular Facetime video chats. Mr and Mrs Bates believe that because Erin has already beaten so many battles in her short le that she can win this latest fight. However they are angry that some members of the public are still flouting the lockdown rules which may result in the virus continuing to spread. Mr Bates, a mechanic for Toyota, old Mail Online: People are still not taking this outbreak seriously and that upsets me. I take it personally. There was a picture Iaposve seen of a beach where there was an ice cream hut open with people queuing outside like it was a normal day. It horries me that people still are not sticking to the lockdown measures. It does upset both of us. Mrs Bates wrote on Facebook : All I’m seeing lately is jokes about coronavirus. I understand humour is very important to keep you going through this hard time but please think about those people it does effect.Our little girl has lung and heart disease and floppy airways and is still currently sitting in intensive care,our little girl catches this virus she won’t be as lucky to fight it. The anxiety every time a new nurse or doctor comes into our bay is getting unbearable. And the simplest things like going to get a drink downstairs now scares me so much so that I don’t and I isolate myself so I don’t have to come into contact with anyone just to keep my little girl alive. So please people before posting jokes and silly comments please think about who might see or read it, as some of us are living in this nightmare and are going to find these months extremely dficult. In another Facebook post she wrote: Both myself and Wayne are utterly heartbroken yet again that we are in a position where we may lose our little girlshe doesnapost carry on fighting. Please, please, please keep Erin in your prayers. We canapost lose her over this virus. She has battled through too much – we need her, she completes us.  I hope that those who havenapost taken this virus serious read this and I hope it now sinks in. Mr Bates said that when Erin was born, he and his we had been told they might not be able to have children so were aposover the moonapos after trying to start a family for  years. But their daughteraposs first six months have been an emotional rollercoaster as she was diagnosed with a catalogue of medical conditions including a heart condition that meant she had open heart surgery in December. In January, she also suffered a respiratory virus, which causes a potentially fatal bout of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in babies. Erin also suffered tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia which affected her her windpipe and its branches into the lungs, and already required use of the CPAP machine. She is currently in a stable condition and her parents have thanked the dedicated NHS workers at the hospital. The family have received messages of support from well-wishers on Facebook.  "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus live pandemic uk updates","story":"NewsCoronavirus LIVE updates: Lockdown wont be lted this week as UK not past the peakBoris Johnson tested negative for coronavirus when he left hospital and is recovering at Chequers while doing no governmental work as the UK death toll rose by  to more than ,ShareByAbigail OLearyDanya BazaraaSenior News ReporterUpdated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video boris-johnson-makes-first-statement-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-live-pandemic-uk-updates-\"\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-fargate-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-live-pandemic-uk-updates- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-fargate-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"Dominic Raab told todayaposs daily press briefing that the Government will not be lting the UK coronavirus lockdown this week.The Foreign Secretary said the UK was still not past the peak of the virus and added that we donapost expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place after scientic advisory groupmeets later this week.

She had been reported missing by concerned relatives on Motheraposs Day and officers later broke into her home and made a chilling discovery. Police said that the retired midwe had a severe blunt trauma head injury. More details of the her death emerged as an inquest was opened and adjourned at North Staffordshire Coroneraposs Court. It comes as police secured a European Arrest Warrant as part of their attempts to extradite a -year-old man from Sweden. They say they want to speak to the man in connection with her death. The inquest was told how Wendy had been reported missing by her daughter on Sunday, March  after she failed to get any response when she knocked on the door of her Tunstall Road home. Police soon broke in and made the terrible discovery.  North Staffordshire assistant coroner Sarah Murphy said: The circumstances reported to the coroneraposs court are that the deceased lived alone and was having building work done at the house. She was not satisfied with the builder and another contractor was due to start. On March  via social media she last had contact with her family. Her daughter later sent her a message but it was not replied to. Her daughter became concerned and visited her on March . There was no reply to her knocking on the door and she found flowers on the doorstep sent by her brother. She became concerned and contacted the police and reported the deceased as a missing person.  Police arrived and checked the property and while at the back they noticed a curtain hanging from the window of the conservatory. They saw there was furniture covered and on the floor it looked like there was a body covered in plastic sheeting. They found the deceased on the floor in the conservatory. The deceased had a severe blunt trauma head injury. There were signs of a disturbance as there was glass and a bottle smashed on the floor. We donapost have a cause of death. A post-mortem examination has been requested and there is reason to suspect that the death was violent and unnatural and therefore an inquest is necessary.

Do you know a coronavirus hero  Get in touch with your story at  webnews@mirror Joe, who repaid the cash a short time later, was incredibly touched by her random act of kindness. He wrote: Queuing outside in the sunshine, it was great to see the Sainsbury’s team working away calmly and professionally, but sharing a laugh with the queuing customers, too. I was shopping for my parents and my uncle as well as for my own family, so ended up spending over an hour inside searching the shelves for unfamiliar products, only to find that – once I’d run everything through checkout – I’d left my wallet at home. A young lady who had just finished at the next checkout immediately offered to pay for me – well over £ – despite not knowing me from Adam. Not only that, she then waited around, with her young child, while I ran my parents’ and my uncle’s shopping through, too, and paid for that as well.  Thank you Sainsbury’s staff for keeping calm and carrying on, but more than anything, thank you Ky F for showing how wonderful people can be when the chips are down. Ky was tracked down and approached by Leicestershire Live. Currently furloughed from work, she said she had been shopping with her daughter, five-year-old Bella, when she spotted Joe and realised he was in a pickle.

Mum-of-one Aleisha, , told the Daily Record “People need to realise this isn’t a normal virus- it’s very dangerous and scary. “People may think it won’t harm them but they could be carrying it and pass it on to someone who’s not able to fight it off the same. “The quicker people start realising it is very serious and start listening to what the Prime Minister is saying about staying home, the quicker it’ll be over.” Speaking about how scary it was when her daughter caught the virus, she said : “I couldn’t stop worrying about her in case she caught what we had with her only being  weeks. “I noticed Kinsey just wasn’t herself.

Dr Sanjay Patel, a consultant in paediatric infectious diseases at Southampton Childrenaposs Hospital, said fewer children with conditions such as appendicitis, dehydration and sepsis were being brought to its emergency department. He said that some mums and dads were assuming that all illnesses were being caused by Covid- or were not seeking healthcare due to fears over contracting the virus. He has now helped develop national guidance on childrenaposs health to enable parents to assess when they should be seeking help. It consists of a red, amber and green traffic light system advising parents of which symptoms require them to seek urgent medical advice and the options available to them. Dr Patel said: These are extremely challenging and worrying times for families and I canapost stress how important it is to follow the Government advice about social distancing in order to slow down the speed of Covid-. However, Iaposm really worried there is a very real risk that some children with illnesses such as appendicitis, dehydration or even sepsis are not being brought to see healthcare professionals as quickly as they would be normally. We are seeing fewer children than we would expect to see at this time of year, particularly through our emergency department, and those we are seeing who do not have Covid- are more severely unwell. Weaposve seen evidence of this in Hampshire as well as across the country. Faces of the NHS heroes who have died during the coronavirus pandemic He continued: We know that the message about Covid- is so powerful and parents are putting most childrenaposs illnesses down to this. The other issue is that they are just too scared to bring their child to see a healthcare professional because they are worried that they might pick up Covid-. Therefore, it is really important for parents to recognise that Covid- is not causing severe infection and illness in most children. He added: If your child is unwell donapost assume they have Covid-, please take a look at the resources weaposve developed andyour child has any of the red or amber features seek help urgently.

It is now more than two months since the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the UK. Since the virus first began edging its way towards the UK public health officials have warned that new, persistent coughs and fevers are tell-tale signs of the disease. Other, milder symptoms have also become hallmarks of the disease in recent weeks. These include physical and mental fatigue, loss of sense of smell and a lack of appetite.As more and more people have been struck down by Covid- and understanding of the disease has grown, an even fuller list of symptoms has emerged. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@trinitymirror   A buzzing sensation One of the more curious ones is a buzzing sensation that runs through the body. While it has not been listed as an official symptom to watch out for, many people have posted online about experiencing a aposfizzingapos sensation. Tarana Burke, recognised as the founder of the #MeToo movement, said that her partner had the illness and the sensation that his aposskin felt like it was burningapos. Twitter user @Miafia described having “an electric feeling on my skin.” Dr Daniel Grfin, chief of infectious disease at ProHealth Care Associates in the US, has suggested the feeling may be part of an auto-immune response to a patientsapos nervous system. “Clearly it’s been identied, but we’re just not sure yet how widespread it is,” he told the New York Post. Dr Vipul Shah, Clinical Director at telehealth service Pack Health, suggested it may simply be people experiencing a fever for the first time. Needing the toilet Another mild symptom of coronavirus that is being reported with increased regularity is the need to go to the toilet more often. Dr Diana Gall explained to the Express : Digestion problems and changes in bowel habits - particularly looser stools and making more frequent trips to the toilet - are sometimes the first signs that you’re coming down with something, not just with this coronavirus.  However, diarrhoea has been reported as an early symptom in patients who have later tested positive for Covid-. A new study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, analysed data  patients with Covid- in China’s Hubei province and found nearly  per cent had diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain. Isla Haslam, , from Balham, South West London, experienced stomach problems while suffering with the coronavirus. She realised that what she first thought was the consequences of a lentil heavy dinner was in fact coronavirus when she began to feel feverish. Testicular pain The third, slightly less common symptom of the coronavirus, is testicular pain. Researchers from  Hard Medical School filed a case report about a -year-old man who tested positive for the virus, after going to hospital with a ‘stabbing pain’ in his testicles. While doctors could find nothing wrong with his  testicles, and CT scan showed damage in his lungs. Two days later, the man was diagnosed with Covid-.  Unfortunately, because the man had atypical symptoms, several other patients and doctors may have unknowingly been exposed to the virus. While it remains unclear whether or not his testicular pain was linked to the virus, other viruses have been known to affect the testicles. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for seven days. You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild.Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others as it can take  days for them to appear. DO NOT go to your GP or hospital. Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice. Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  Speaking to  MailOnline, Dr Viney, a surgeon in Birmingham, said: “There are certain viruses that can affect the testicles, such as mumps. “Only time will tellCOVID- also affects the testicles but it isn’t a symptom many of the patients I’ve dealt with have complained about. For most of them, their testicles are the least of their worries.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman helping vulnerable friend supplies","story":"NewsWoman helping vulnerable friend with supplies s to car to find nasty noteSarah Crossland, of Morley, Leeds, was shocked to find a passive-aggressive note slipped into her car that accused her of breaking the coronavirus lockdown rulesShareCommentsByRobert Sutclfe:,  APR NewsSarah Crossland urged people not to jump to conclusions \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Out come the burgers, hot dogs, sausages, chicken legs, fish and tasty char-grilled veg, all cooked in the sunshine. Most homes have a designated BBQ chef, who has their own special way of cooking outside - but Gordon Ramsay says theyaposre doing it all wrong. And since he owns a burger restaurant in Las Vegas he obviously knows what heaposs talking about. In a video viewed more than million times, Gordon explains not only how to make the perfect patty but all of the most common mistakes we make and how to avoid them. Gordon said: This is one of my most desired burgers, one of my favourite burgers and then goes on to mention that this burger is on sale at his burger restaurant in Planet Hollywood, Las Vegas, and is known as the F-Word burger. Use dferent meats Gordon explains that the secret behind a perfect burger is a mixture of dferent quality meats. He uses chuck, as well as ground beef and brisket. Preparation is key Gordon generously seasons the meat with salt and pepper and binds it altogether using a touch of egg. He says you canapost season the burgers after theyaposre cooked so he makes sure to roll the seasoning around the edge of the burger too. But says this should be done the day beforepossible, then you need to set them in the fridge so they stay nice and firm and donapost fall apart on the grill. And when it comes to cooking the bruegrs, donapost put them straight onto the heat from the fridge because then theyaposll be dry on the outside and raw in the middle. Drizzle a little olive oil onto them too - he uses grapeseed oil.  Put the BBQ lid down When you place the burgers onto the grill it should be piping hot and you should place them onto the hottest part - which is usually two thirds of the way up. When youaposve placed the burgers on the grill Gordon explains: The secret is to move it as less as possible. The more you move it, the more chance youaposve got of breaking the burger. Make sure to put the BBQ lid down once your burgers are in as this incorporates the heat, and gets a great sear on the bottom, so when we come to turn those burgers they donapost stick. How many times have you stuck burgers on the grill and wondered why itaposs sticking  Nicely oiled, quick sear and put that lid down - itaposs really important.  Toasting the buns Once the burgers are cooking the next step is to toast the buns. Gordon says We toast the buns because thereaposs nothing worse than a soggy bun. Toasting the bun makes them nice and crisp, and it protects the burger. He seasons the buns with salt, pepper and a drizzle of oil, before putting them on the grill and closing the lid again. And even toasts the tops of the bun too.  Get set up Gordon ensures that the rest of his ingredients are prepped, ready for when the burgers are cooked - they only take three to four minutes each side to cook completely. Tomatoes and lettuce are chopped, and the onions are on the grill cooking. He said: This is a really important tip. Why  It stops the burgers going cold - you want to at it when itaposs piping hot.  Adding butter Approximately two minutes before the burgers are ready to come off, Gordon adds butter. Gordon says: “Now at my burger restaurant in Las Vegas, we baste the burgers with Devonshire butter. “Today, we’re going to lightly brush a bit of butter onto the burgers. “With that flame underneath, it caramelises the butter and puts this wonderful flavour on top. “It makes the burgers so tasty.” He also suggests making a red-wine butter or a chipotle butteryou want to be even more chefy. And lightly season them again with salt and pepper.

Zhengli is one of the worldaposs top researchers on coronaviruses and has discovered dozens of deadly SARS-like viruses in bat caves. She studied samples taken from some of the first people to become infected with the new and then-mysterious respiratory illness in China in December and found it was similar to SARS. It was identied as a novel coronavirus and within three days she completed its gene sequencing, finding that it was  per cent identical to a virus found in horseshoe bats in Yunnan, a process which can take monthsnot years. The claims are the latest to emerge after a cover-up by Chinese authorities who failed to share information or issue warnings early on and, ultimately, contain a virus that emerged in Wuhan and then spread around the world, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and more than a million confirmed infections.Chinese journalist Gao Yu said he spoke to Shi during his incarceration in Wuhan, which was locked down for more than two months, and she told him her findings were hushed up, the  Mail on Sunday  reported.The journalist added: We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January  but was muzzled. The information about gene sequencing wasnapost made public until a week later. It is now being used around the globe in a race against time to find a cure and vaccine for the deadly bug, which has already infected more than .million people around the world and caused , deaths. For Zhengli the disocvery of the coronavirus gene sequence is the culmination of more than  years work, which has made her one of the worldaposs leading scientists in her field. But when the virologist received the fateful call on December  last year, just after the first patient samples had arrived at the lab in Wuhan, she admits she knew she would be about the battle her worst nightmare. And Zhengli had one overriding fear - had the new virus been accidentally unleashed by the lab she worked in. In the  years she had been working with bats, Zhengli had found the subtropical areas of China posed the biggest risk for the coronavirus being transmitted from animals to human - not the centre of the country where Wuhan is located. She said: I had never expected this kind of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China. I remember thinking aposcould they have come from our lab apos Zhengli was at a conference outside Wuhan when she received the terrying phonecall that would change the course of the world. Two hospital patients had an unusual type of pneumonia and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention needed Zhengliaposs expertise amid fears this new strain of the virus could be a deadly risk to public health. Her director told her to drop whatever you are doing and deal with it now and she was immediately on a train back to the lab in Wuhan. Zhengli and her team worked round the clock to find the genetic code of this new strain of coronavirus as the Covid- spread around the world like wildfire. But it was a moment she had spent her entire career working towards - starting with her first virus expedition back in . Zhengli travelled to bat colonies located in caves near Nanning, which she described as spellbinding. But the work was hard, with long hikes and risky decents into caves to find the creatures - and could often be frustrating. She was part of the team who were searching for the source of the SARS epidemic after a team from Hong Kong had reported that civets, which are similar to mongoose, had been the source of the virus and they were found in the subtropical parts of Asia and Africa. Before SARS the world had been blissfully unaware of the devastating impact of the coronavirus family but the epidemic led to a global push to both learn more and work to prevent a pandemic - and Zhengli was part of that early team. And the one thing that seemed to be key in the outbreak of a coronavirus was that they had started in bats before spreading to other animals and then humans. For months, work on the epedition was relentless with the team waking at dusk to work ovrnight when the bats had left the caves to hunt for food. They would collect blood, saliva and fecal swabs before grabbing a few hours sleep only tothe following morning to collect urine. For weeks there was no sign of coronavirus in the DNA that had been collected. Zhengli was heartbroken. She said: Eight months of hard work seemed to have gone down the drain. We thought coronaviruses probably did not like Chinese bats. At the end of their patience, the team were about tohome when another lab gave them a diagnostic kit for testing antibodies produced by people with SARS. Admitting she didnapost have high hopes it would work, Zhengli said she had nothing to lose by testing the samples and the results were incredible and was a turning project for the scheme. Antibodies against SARS were found in three species of horseshoe bats, which meant they were one step closer to finding the genetic code. After testing a huge number of sites, the team then narrowed their search down to the outskirts of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan and for the next five years they targeted their research on that area. Horryingly, the team discovered hundreds of strains of coronaviruses but thankfully just dozens were similar to SARS, could infect human lungs and were immune to vaccines and cures that had proved successful against other forms of the virus. And finally, in one cave, the scientists found what seemed to be the epicentre for SARS - but this came with an added risk. It meant millions of bats were mixing and creating increasing opportunities for the virus to evolve and for new strains to emerge. They also found that the virus could spread to those who werenapost directly handling the animals. People living in a nearby village had seen bats flying around. Six people had suffered from symptoms similar to SARS. And this was not the only time Zhengli and her team had found evidence bats were spreading a new strain of the deadly virus. Six miners had been struck down with an illness similar to SARS and when Zhengli investigated the mineshaft where they were working, they discovered it was covered in a disgusting-smelling fungus. The mine was closed immediately to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. Zhengli fears that the more humans move into areas previously havens for wildle, the greater the risk of unleashing new coronaviruses on the population. This coupled with the movement of wildle and livestock around the world, along with increased long-haul travel, creates conditions perfect for the potential spread of a pandemic - something Zhengli has long feared. A year ago, Zhengli and her team published a study warning of the potential of a bat-borne pandemic. Little did they know just  months later their doomsday predictions would come true. Then, at the turn of the year, everything they had been preparing for for the last  years suddenly needed to kick into action. Amplying the genetic material of the virus using the polymerase chain reaction technique Zhengli and her team found five of the infected patients had the same genetic sequences found in all coronaviruses. Zhengli admits she didnapost sleep at all during those first few days of frantic testing and a week after the first case had been reported she was certain a new strain of coronavirus has caused the sickness that had killed the patients - and Covid- was born. Chillingly, it also showed there had been just one point where the virus had passed from animals to human and had then spread through human to human contact - until it covered the world. They also found the virus could have been in existance for months but hadnapost started to spread until it reached Wuhan - and its wildle markets where animals are sold, slaughtered and skinned, as customers browse the stalls. They sell a range of creatures, such as bats, civets, pangolins, badgers and crocodiles, although Zhengli and her team believe the virus came directly from the bats themselves. Almost two months after the first cases of the virus emerged in Wuhan, China permanently banned wildle consumption and trade. It is estimated this will forced million people out of work and cost the Chinese economy about £billion, however, Zhengli believes the consumption and trade of wildle is not the whole problem. Bats are believed to have responsible for six outbreaks of coronaviruses, including the Covid- pandemic, but experts insist problems only occur when people come into contact with the creatures themselves.Le is Wuhan is slowly ing to normal, although China has recorded its highest number of daily new  coronavirus  cases in almost six weeks, sparking fears of a second wave of Covid- after restrictions were eased.A total of  new coronavirus cases were reported in mainland China on Sunday, up from  a day earlier and marking the highest number of cases since  infections were reported on March . But for two months Zhengli barely left her lab and survived on nothing but instant noodles as she and her team worked to not only identy the virus but come up with the key to a cure. The found how it gets into human lungs and are now working on drugs that can block it, as well as trying to come up with a vaccine and trial it on people. Zhengli describes the Wuhan outbreak as a wake-up call for the world and work is now taking place around the globe to find a way to prevent another pandemic.

Officials say the sudden rise is due to infected travellers arriving from abroad, many of them crossing the border from Russia. A total of  new coronavirus cases were reported in mainland China on Sunday, up from  a day earlier and marking the highest number of cases since  infections were reported on March . Heilongjiang province, which borders Russia in the north-east, has become Chinaaposs new battleground against Covid- as the rise threatens to push the entire country back into a state of near paralysis. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. The National Health Commission said  of the new cases - or more than  per cent - were imported, a new record. A total of  Chinese nationals who entered Heilongjiang province from Russia tested positive. Our little town here, we thought it was the safest place, said a resident of the border city of Suenhe, who only gave his surname as Zhu. Some Chinese citizens they want to come back, but itaposs not very sensible, what are you doing coming here for   Though the number of daily infections across China have dropped sharply from the height of the epidemic in February, China has seen the daily toll creep higher after hitting a trough on March  because of the rise in imported cases. Chinese cities near the border with Russia are tightening border controls and imposing stricter quarantines in response to influx of infected patients from the country.  Suenhe last week announced restrictions on movements and gatherings similar to those imposed in Wuhan city, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged late last year, and extended the closure of its border with Russia. The land route through the city had become one of few options available for Chinese nationals trying to get into China after Russia stopped all flights to the country.  Suenhe and Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang, are now mandating  days of quarantine for all arrivals from abroad as well as nucleic acid and antibody tests. Streets in Suenhe were virtually empty on Sunday evening due to restrictions of movement. Residents said a lot of people had left the city as the number of infected people crossing the border from Russia rose. I donapost need to worry, Zhao Wei, another Suenhe resident, told Reuters. If thereaposs a local transmission, I would, but thereaposs not a single one. Theyaposre all from the border, but theyaposve all been sent to quarantine. In Shanghai, authorities found that  people who arrived on Aeroflot flight SU from Moscow on April  have the coronavirus, Zheng Jin, a spokeswoman for the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, told a press conference on Monday.  China has cut the number of people crossing its borders by  per cent and has tried to stop all non-essential journeys, said Liu Haitao, an immigration official, at a separate briefing on Monday. Our border is long, and apart from the border crossings and passages, there are a large number of mountain passes, paths, ferry crossings and small roads, and the situation is very complicated, he said. Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Center for Diseases Prevention and Control in Beijing, said the trend for local transmission of the disease in the capital was low. Imported cases are still the highest risk in Beijing in the second half of April, Pang said, adding that nearly eight per cent of the , nucleic acid tests carried out in the city since April  had been conducted on people who had come from abroad. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China now stands at , as of Sunday.  At the peak of the first wave of the epidemic on February  there were over , new cases. Though the number of daily infections across China has dropped sharply from that peak, China has seen the daily toll creep higher after hitting a trough on March  because of the rise in imported cases. China has been accused of underreporting its total number of infections. China hid work of Bat Woman scientist China is accused of hiding the findings of a coronavirus expert - known as Bat Woman - after she quickly identied the genetic make-up of the new strain that has infected millions. Wuhan-based virologist Shi Zhengli is one of the worldaposs top researchers on coronaviruses and has discovered dozens of deadly SARS-like viruses in bat caves. She studied samples taken from some of the first people to become infected with the new and then-mysterious respiratory illness in China in December and found it was similar to SARS.  It was identied as a novel coronavirus and within three days she completed its gene sequencing, finding that it was  per cent identical to a virus found in horseshoe bats in Yunnan. But she was muzzled and her team was ordered not to reveal any information about the new disease, which was already spreading rapidly as China kept the world in the dark. The claims are the latest to emerge after a cover-up by Chinese authorities who failed to share information or issue warnings early on and, ultimately, contain a virus that emerged in Wuhan and then spread around the world, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and more than a million confirmed infections. Chinese journalist Gao Yu said he spoke to Shi during his incarceration in Wuhan, which was locked down for more than two months, and she told him her findings were hushed up, the Mail on Sunday reported. The journalist added: We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January  but was muzzled. The information about gene sequencing wasnapost made public until a week later. The day that the genetic information was mapped, Yanyi Wang, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, ordered staff not to reveal any information about the disease, it is claimed. After local doctors were detained for warning locals about the virus, the director claimed inappropriate and inaccurate information was causing general panic.  She ordered staff not to post any information on social media or speak to the media. Just over a week later, a team in Shanghai published a sequence on an open access  after studying samples from an infected patient. Their laboratory was shut for rectication two days later. One of the earliest Covid- cases emerged in mid-December when a patient, who worked at a wildle market in Wuhan that became the early epicentre of the outbreak, was hospitalised with a double lung infection in the city in central China. The usual treatment for flu-like illness failed to work and new cases soon emerged. The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need. Our Mirror Coronavirus Heroes series wants to recognise all of those helping the most vulnerable during the crisis. Whether itaposs a local business going the extra mile for the community or a teenager helping an elderly neighbour, we want to hear about it. You can email your stories of Mirror Coronavirus Heroes to webnews@mirror. On December , Wuhan health officials were told that the illness was being caused by a new coronavirus. Three days later, at least two doctors from Wuhan - Li Wenliang and Ai Fen - shared information about the new virus on the social network WeChat. Li, a whistleblower who was warned by police to stop making  comments, died in February after contracting the virus. Ai is missing after giving media interviews criticising Chinaaposs censorship and hospital authorities for suppressing early warnings of the outbreak. She told the Chinese magazine, Renwu, or People, that she was reprimanded after alerting her bosses and colleagues of the new virus in December.  On  December, she received the laboratory results of one case which stated: SARS coronavirus. The next day, Wuhan officials confirmed almost  cases, shut down the wildle market and notied the World Health Organisationaposs local office about the mysterious illness. New cases continued to emerge and the outbreak was spreading outside of China, but for a week in January health officials in Wuhan insisted they had not received any new patients. During that time, the first known case outside of China was detected in Thailand and a case was reported in the US as infected people left Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province to travel across the country and around the world. Chinese authorities insisted they hadnapost seen any clear evidence that the virus could be spread from human to human.  By then they had lost control and hospitals were becoming overwhelmed by the rising number of infected patients. Within days Dr Zhong Nanshan, the countryaposs top respiratory expert and the face of its containment effort, revealed that human transmission was taking place. Wuhan and several other cities struggling to contain the virus went into lockdown on January , days before the Lunar New Year holiday, but by then millions of people had left without being screened. That day, Shi Zhengli and her research team published their data identying the illness on a scientic portal before it was published in February by the medical journal Nature. In the weeks that followed the lockdown in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread to and within other countries due to imported cases and community transmission.  China is still censoring academic research into the origins of the new strain of coronavirus. The authorities have placed new restrictions on the publication of research that could shed new light on how it was passed from an animal to a human. All academic papers are being given extra vetting before being submitted for publication, it emerged on Monday. Studies must be approved by the central government before they are shared with the rest of the world, according to since-deleted online posts by two Chinese universities. A researcher told CNN that the new restrictions were another attempt by China to cover up its failures and would likely disrupt important scientic research. The researcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation, added: I think it is a coordinated effort fromChinese government to controlnarrative, and paint it asthe outbreak did not originate in China. And I donapost think they will really tolerate any objective study to investigate the origination of this disease. PPE bound for UK held up by red tape Meanwhile, personal protective equipmentis being sent from China to the UK amid shortages at healthcare facilities in Britain and the deaths of almost  NHS workers. However, much of the kit from China is unusable because it fails UK safety checks.  Some shipments are being held up by red tape in China, the worldaposs biggest supplier of PPE, and some are wrongly labelled and do not contain the right gear, it has emerged. For example, a crate is labelled gowns but it contains masks instead. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast there were concerns about a shortage of PPE in some hospitals. Stocks of gowns have run critically low, he added. Mr Hopson said the supply of gowns - imported from China - was hand-to-mouth.

This has been dficult to accept.“The SPFL board and executive freely admit that they focused on the sporting merit of the proposal and did not take into consideration any financial fall out to their member clubs.“Fundamentally, we believe that in these exceptional and uncertain times, no member club should be worse off as a result of this proposal than they are today.“The current proposal will see member clubs cumulatively have in the region of £.-£ million pounds of lost revenue.“Amongst the member clubs there have been numerous discussions of the SPFL’s offer as well as viable, equitable proposed alternatives that could see, potentially, a neutral outcome for all clubs involvedthe season cannot be finished.“In all cases, current placement monies could be distributed to the member clubs in very short order while maintaining all SPFL obligations.“Make no mistake we would have to work quickly and diligently to ensure that members’ current needs are met and that the democratic process is followed, but it is achievable.”An SPFL spokesperson added: “It is very important that clubs consider carefully the resolution and we are grateful to those clubs who have voted already.“With the Ladbrokes Premiership and Ladbrokes Leagues One and Two isions each having approved the resolution, we await the voting slip from the one Ladbrokes Championship club that has yet to vote.“We will provide an update as soon as we are in a position to do so.”The SPFL set an initial deadline of pm for clubs to vote.However it is understood league rules give members  days to vote on resolutions – and Dundee are keen to weigh up their options.It is believed Partick Thistle and Inverness Caley Thistle were the two Championship sides to vote against the plan.As a result, Dundee appear to be in a position to set whichever agenda they please in negotiations with the SPFL.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

I was free to talk to clubs.“I spoke to Mark McGhee at Motherwell and Gus MacPherson at St Mirren.“The chance to go to England and play for that club [Coventry] came up and it was a no-brainer really.“My agent and I sat down…we didn’t need to think about it.“There were other reasons why it was more beneficial for me – you’re trying to make a living in your career.“I had three top-flight teams up here who I had the chance to go to.“Lee Wilkie was at Dundee United at the time. I remember Craig saying that he would be one of the people I’d be coming in to try and play beside.“That was the three teams interested but thankfully I chose Coventry.“I really enjoyed the experience of playing and living in England. I was down there at .“I think I played my best football at Coventry.”The Dark Blues gaffer and Hearts legend Levein would cross paths again years later, this time with international football on the agenda.But for McPake and Scotland, it wasn’t meant to be and he ended up being capped by Northern Ireland and Michael O’Neill.He said: “I was at Coventry and Craig Levein was Scotland manager at the time.“Michael McBride, our physio, worked with me at Livingston and he was the national team physio.“He’d be telling me, ‘They’re down watching you’.“A few times I was really close. I was desperate to just get in and experience it.“But it got to the point that Michael O’Neill heard I could play with Northern Ireland [through a Coleraine-born grandparent].“He called Allan Preston [football agent] and Alan called me.“I said, ‘Can you ask Craig what the chances with Scotland would be ’ To be fair to Craig, he said, ‘I’d never say it’s a definite no buthe’s got the chance to play international football then I’d take it’.“Without saying ‘definitely no’, he definitely did say no!“I’ve still got mixed emotions about it. My dad wasn’t too sure, he didn’t want me to do it.“Other people advised me to do it and I had some great trips. I got one cap but I was in the squad seven or eight times.“Getting to train with people like Jonny Evans, Steven Davis…I loved the training and I loved the trips.“I would’ve liked to get more game time but it was causing a problem to my back and ultimately that’s why I stopped.”He made his Northern Ireland debut in a - hammering at the hands of the Netherlands on June , , just weeks after his Hibs side were beaten - by Hearts in the Scottish Cup Final.McPake – who came up against Dutch stars Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie – said: “It wasn’t like a normal friendly, it was mayhem.“The Amsterdam Arena was packed. I’m looking at it and going, ‘Wow’.“I think in that two weeks, with the Scottish Cup Final and then that game, I got beat - on aggregate.“I had a week in Dubai between that so I suppose that makes up for it.”McPake is approaching six years at Dens Park, after initially joining as a player in May , and he didn’t envisage such a long spell at the club.He said: “If I did, I’d be living in Dundee or somewhere around about there. I often say that to Dawn [we]. I love it up there.“In terms of players, Cammy [Kerr] was there – he was only a young boy. Gowser [Paul McGowan] signed at the same time as me.“It’s genuinely the best club I’ve worked with in terms of all the people there.

I first got worried when I went to Tesco with my mum and the shelves were empty, we couldn’t get any of our usual shopping then my school closed.I was excited but then it sank in that this wasn’t for a fun reason or for a holiday, it was to keep us all safe. I got quite worried when we were sent home and I had a lot of questions in my head like what’s going to happen  When will school reopen  Will everyone be ok  How will people cope being inside all the time I didn’t mind doing schoolwork at home, it was hard to adjust to just doing my work by myself and not having my friends and my teacher around. It’s also really distracting being at home, so sometimes I don’t think I was that focused, sometimes the day went quick other days it felt long. My mum says I eat a lot and we have done lots of baking to save us going to the shops. I can’t wait to go and meet my friends again and I kind of miss that part of school the most.I really miss my football, most of all I miss my freedom to go where I want to.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water.

He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears. You could use them.The hare stroked his ears.ldquoSo I do he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so the squirrel and hare ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, collecting as much water as possible.They both ed to the fire, and stood a safe distance away.

Hotel owners Cameron and Susan Law intend to step down from the business, which has been in the family for  years,the proposals are given the green light.Susan, who was previously chairwoman of Muirfield Riding Therapy, which offers free horseriding for people with disabilities, stressed that The Mallard Hotel would remain open prior to any development.At the time of the public exhibition, she told the Courier: ldquoI think, initially, I was quite shocked that it was going to be knocked down but in retrospect it is the best thing, really.ldquoObviously, we will be sad to see it go but we will take The Mallard Hotel with us, is how I am thinking now.

Where do you feel the anxiety  Be conscious of what your body is telling you. Is your heart racing, stomach churning  To help ease these symptoms, be mindful of your breathing. Inhale through your nose for  slowly and exhale through your mouth again counting to  slowly. Repeat this exercise four times.AwarenessWe cannot control how her lersquos have changed due to this pandemic but what we can control is our thoughts to this global crisis. To quote from the Greek philosopher Epictetus ldquoPeople are not disturbed not by things, but by the views they take of them. Through awareness of how our thoughts make us feel, we can challenge these to more positive helpful thoughts. Awareness is the key to unlocking our distorted thoughts and through recognising whether we are for example predicting, judging or catastrophising, this can assist us in challenging and changing these negative obtrusive thoughts to more positive helpful ones.Self-CareTake this time as an opportunity to look after self. Self-care is crucial for building up resilience to le events and there is no time more important than in the now to engage in self-care: it is a priority. Self-care consists of several elements:Physical self-care such as nutrition, exercise and sleep.Mental self-care such as being aware of our thoughts and behaviours and engaging in activities such as crosswords. Emotional Self-care such as being aware of our emotions for example anger and sadness and how these can be managed. For example, through keeping a daily journal to recognise the triggers for our emotions.Spiritual Self-care such as awareness of when our minds are racing with thoughts and to try and be still. Engage in activities such as meditation, mindfulness and through being still in the now this will quieten the racing mind and provide strength at this challenging time. Take time to assess your self-care by implementing a self-care plan and commence small steps to change through looking after self. ldquoAn empty lantern provides no light. Self-care is the fuel that allows your light to shine brightly. If you find yourself struggling with anxiety, low mood or lapsing into unhelpful ways of coping, then contact Sharon.

Situated on the banks of the River Teviot, in an award-winning conversion of the former Victorian electrical works, the distillery is laying down spirit for a future Single Malt release, makes an excellent gin, and recently released a vodka.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin is genuinely Scottish Gin ndash wholly distilled from barley grown within  miles of the distillery. It is named after William Kerr ndash Hawick-born, and among the th centuryrsquos most accomplished botanists. He sent  plant specimens back to Kew Gardens from his Far East travels.Kerr would likely have approved of the distilleryrsquos Carterhead Still ndash one of only a handful in operation. It gently heats the botanicals rather than boiling them like most other gin stills, capturing more of the subtle flavours. Together with the barley, this gives the gin a distinctive depth. The rounded flavour works well with the bitterness of tonic water, creating a beautully balanced GT.The newest addition to distilleryrsquos range is Puffing Billy Steam Vodka ndash unfiltered malted barley vodka, named after the special still which plays a key role in its production. The spirit is steamed through charcoal inside the still itself and never filtered as a liquid, preserving the delicious character of the barley.Itrsquos the only vodka in the world made this way, and drinks commentators have praised the result, suggesting it could reinvigorate vodka, a spirit somewhat overlooked during the recent gin boom. Fabulous with tonic or Ginger Beer, the vodka also tastes incredibly smooth sipped chilled and straight.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin and Puffing Billy Steam Vodka are available direct from the distilleryrsquos online shop, currently offering free delivery anywhere within the UK when you buy a bottle.See www.thebordersdistillery shop ------------------------------------------------The Mortgage Advice Service ScotlandRe-mortgaging During the Coronavirus OutbreakAlthough health concerns are their immediate priority, people are searching for ways to reduce their monthly expenditure and cutting their biggest monthly outlay makes financial sense.Although the Coronavirusis having a signicant impact on obtaining funds for purchasing a new home, re-mortgages are still available from lenders at competitive rates and depending on the size of your mortgage, you could make substantial savings each month by simply changing lenders.Re-mortgaging neednt be a hassleEvenyou can save hundreds of pounds by shopping around, the thought of trying to switch your current mortgage may seem like a hassle you could do without.However, re-mortgaging isnt nearly as much hassle as you may think, because, thats where we step in and do all the work that is involved in finding you a fresh deal that can lower your monthly payments and maybe even help you to pay off your mortgage quicker.Choosing the right mortgage can be tricky.Next to purchasing your home, choosing the right mortgage is probably one of the most important decisions you will make when you are looking for a new deal.Approaching your current lender or bank may not result in you obtaining the best mortgage deal because they generally only consider their own products.

The place was an Aladdinrsquos cave of implements for cutting, sawing, pounding, impaling. If you owned a Texas ranch and had a yearning to renew the fences, everything yoursquod need is here. So tooyou had to exterminate rats or mice, wasps, beetles, or any other pest that was getting in your way. There was a corner devoted to horses, with enough combs, brushes and hoof-picks to tart them up for Ascot. And there were elixirs and ointments and dips not only for horses but for sheep, pigs and cattle.The store is well placed, beside an auction market. Hundreds of metal corrals encircle the trading hub of this historic mart, the first of its kind in Scotland. It was opened in  by a butcher whose we realised he could do better for himself, and persuaded him to go into the auctioning business.Early in the morning, several times a week, farmers pass our cottage, heading for the mart with lorries and trailers packed with cattle and sheep. A short while later they rattle back home empty. In the present lock-down they are almost the only traffic going by, and I picture all us villagers lting our heads from whatever wersquore doing to watch. Tractors are even more exciting. One went past four times in each direction the other Sunday ndash just turning my head made me feel wiped out.At this time of year, tractors are busy harrowing and fertilising, but the most important activity is lambing. Irsquove never understood why, at Easter, we celebrate with chocolate rabbits when it is newly arrived lambs we should be thinking of. Everywhere you look there are picture-book hillsides of grazing ewes, eating asat an all-day buffet, while their infants dance like popcorn all over the place.By March, lambing season is in full swing, and gravelly bleating is, for me, the sound of spring. As daffodils splash verges and woods with colour, lambs cavort with no thought for tomorrow . The other day, on my way home from a hardware store ndash we needed to repair our wood-burning stove ndash we passed a field whose corner had been fenced off to create a maternity ward. The midwersquos caravan was parked among them, presumably making the midnight sht a little less arduous. Two lambs, sitting as close as eggs in a box, stared at me with beady black eyes, so motionless they appeared not even to blink. At a few days old, they were brilliant white, asstraight out of the washing machine. Their mother, in contrast, was a mess. Her filthy fleece hung off her in shreds, like a catwalk model swaggering down the podium, her woolly cape worn so low off the shoulder it almost trips her up.For any ewe about to go into labour, seeing a new mother in such a ragged state can do nothing for their nerves. Nature is meant to take its course easily in the sheep pen, with none of the coaxing, hand-holding or pain relief humans generally need. And when it comes to the farmyard, most of the time thatrsquos how it works. But as anyone who read James Herriot as a youngster knows, things can quickly go wrong. When they do, it iniably requires middle-of-the-night trips to snow-bound barns, and armpit- gloves.Sheep, a vet once told me, are always finding new ways of dying. Whether during pregnancy and birth, or out on the summer hills, their capacity to self-destruct is impressive. I spare you the details over your quailsrsquo eggs and kedgeree. I spent a lot of time, once, talking to hill sheep farmers, shepherds and vets for a book I was writing. Studying a veterinary textbook on ruminants and their ailments, and the photos in particular, was the most effective diet I ever went on.It made me realise how stoical these creatures are, and how much we take them for granted. With our streets empty and silent, and the knowledge of a highly contagious disease on the loose, these eery times are reminiscent of the dreadful Foot and Mouth outbreak in . Back then, throughout East Lothian where I lived, and in Dumfries and Galloway, where friends were farmers, there was a deathly hush in the countryside. The sight of empty green slopes, where there should be flocks and herds, was a definition of abnormal. As was driving through disinfectant at the gates of every farm. Worst of all were Hieronymus Bosch landscapes of smoking pyres. To blot out the sight and smell, farmers closed windows and curtains.Until that calamity I had never fully appreciated how big a part farm animals play in my understanding and enjoyment of the country. Now that it is us who are under threat, the tables are turned. But for all the bucolic charm of seeing lambsrsquo tails whirling like windmills as they suckle, this season is becoming a headache for farmers. Until Covid-, their main worry was the impact Brexit would have on trade deals and the price of home-reared meat. All that seems far off right now. With some abattoirs and most international borders closing, the farm calendar of breeding, rearing and slaughtering is at grave risk of disruption in the coming months. Among the lessons this crisis might teach us is the value of locally grown produce, and the necessity of being as self-sufficient a country as possible.While we get through this unnerving situation, those of us who live within sight and sound of frolicking lambs, or who follow media-savvy shepherds online, are grateful. The natural order of things is carrying on all around, just waiting for our ."},{"url":null,"title":"ron-mckays-diary-memories-mean-spirits-never-forgetting","story":"Rummaging through a drawer in the kitchen the other day, bored, looking for I know not what, I came across a rather careworn Polaroid photograph dating back more years than I want to recall. I donrsquot know why it was filed among discarded gts from Christmas crackers, bent cutlery and a corkscrew , but it was. When I rubbed away on the surface it revealed me with my arm round the legendary photographer Harry Benson. It was taken by his we Gigi at the Old Course in Troon, where Harry was brought up and where he was back visiting.The word legend is carelessly bandied about, but in this case it applies in neon. Harry was a well-known snapper when he first travelled to the USA with The Beatles in , during their first barnstorming tour of the country, and he decided to stay. Well, the money was better for a start. His pictures ndash and you will have seen them ndash have appeared in Le, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. Hersquos also taken more than  cover shots for People magazine and appeared in countless other publications.Harry chronicled some of the most important moments in modern history. He has photographed every US president from Eisenhower to Trump, the Queen several times, was feet away from Bobby Kennedy the night he was assassinated ndash ldquoI kept telling myself lsquothis is for history, pull yourself together, fail tomorrow, not todayrsquo ndash and he was in the room with Richard Nixon when he resigned. He witnessed the Berlin Wall being built and taken down, and was on civil rights marches with Martin Luther King Jr. He has history coursing through his veins.He also took some stunning and shocking shots of Glasgow, where he was born. Andyou look at his website yoursquore greeted with a large black-and-white picture of Richard Burton giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to Elizabeth Taylor.As we knocked around Troon, Harry showed me one shot he had taken of a major film star which Vanity Fair had passed on because it revealed a track of cocaine from the actorrsquos left nostril.

The live-in daughter, the lawyer, who has never scrubbed a sink or washed a floor in her le, points me to someone called Mrs Hinch who is something called an influencer, because she has three million followers on Instagram who apparently take her advice about which product to scour their lavvie with.Hinch, who is a -something Essex mother, has apparently made a million or more posting videos of her cleaning rituals. Personally Irsquod rather watch paint dry than her spraying her shower and getting stuck in with the rubber gloves. She holds up the cleaner pack to camera before getting busy and apparently each posting earns her around poundk from the manufacturer, and then next day Home Bargains is cleaned out of it by the YouTube generation.Itrsquos cheap advertising for the company, I suppose, and good for Mrs Hinch, who apparently used to suffer with severe anxiety ndash cleaning became her coping mechanism. Yoursquod think she might have some compulsive disordershe wasnrsquot laughing into her Marigolds all the way to the bank.Fake news Why has Donald Trump so vigorously promoted hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid- when therersquos not, as yet, a scintilla of scientic evidence that it works  Itrsquos an anti-malaria drug which also can have severe side-effects, ranging from nausea and hair loss to blindness and cardiac arrest, and, since Trump championed it, speculators have been stockpiling.

But as whisky expert Angus MacRaild was about to find, behind the doors of the impressive property lurked an intoxicating and quite unexpected treasure trove unlike anything he had ever seen before.ldquoI was in the middle of Colorado, several thousand feet above sea level and feeling rather spaced out from jet lag, he recalls.ldquoI was quite discombobulated anyway. But inside this grand house and down the stairs in the basement was a wooden led room ndash a whisky cellar.As he crossed the tartan carpet, his jaw dropped. ldquoThe wooden shelves stretched from the carpet to rafters, specially designed for this whisky collection, he recalls.ldquoNo-one knew about this. It was like a preserved Aladdinrsquos Cave of treasures. It was remarkable.Whisky expert MacRaild had been dispatched to the high plains of Colorado to check out a collection of malt whiskies gathered by a very private enthusiast.What he found was a real-le whisky galore.On each shelf was crammed bottle after bottle of single malt whisky rarities. A  Macallan Fine and Rare -year-old worth an eye-watering pound million, bottle after bottle of  Black Bowmore ndash each one estimated at pound, ndash a Glenfiddich  Rare Collection , one of just  bottles ever produced, and dozens of highly sought-after bottles from lost distilleries: Dallas Dhu, Glenugie, Killyloch, some almost a century old.Still reeling from encountering one of the worldrsquos most stunning and secret collections of single malt whisky, MacRaild spotted something  that would make his heart sing.ldquoAt the back was a typical pub wood bar with a gantry and a wee sink. It was jammed full of bottles.ldquoIt was ridiculous, he laughs. ldquoThere would be a fairly standard bottle of whisky that would cost maybe  or  sitting next to a bottle that was worth ,.ldquoThat was his drinking stock, stuffed behind the bar, ready to be drunk.ldquoThat told me this collector was first and foremost a drinker who loved the social aspect of Scotch whisky.It seemed Gooding ndash who had been raised surrounded by soft drinks bottles so could be forgiven for enjoying the clink of a glass bottle against a tumbler ndash wasnrsquot collecting because he wanted to make a buck. Rather, this was a man who quite simply adored a decent dram.In the coming week, Perthshire-based Whisky Auctioneer will carry out the second part of its sale of Richard Goodingrsquos single malt whiskies ndash named ldquoThe Perfect Collection.The first, in February, saw more than , malts from the collection attract , bidders from  countries. Highlights included a rare Macallan  Valerio Adami -year-old which alone sold for a record-breaking pound,.It raised more than pound million.The second instalment of the collection consisting of almost , bottles went on sale on Friday and will continue for a further eight days. It is expected to achieve a similar sum.Part of the collectionrsquos charm, says MacRaild, is it eccentricity, quality and the fact that no-one knew it was there.ldquoIt was collected before whisky collecting took off as a global phenomenon,\" he says. \"It was an age of innocence when collecting whisky was a niche thing.ldquoThe internet came and changed the face of what was just a hobby.Born in Denverrsquos wealthy Belcaro neighbourhood in , Richard Goodings financial clout to lavish cash on fine whisky was never a problem.His grandfather, James A Gooding, launched the Pepsi Cola Bottling Company of Denver in , supplying bottles of soft drink across Colorado and parts of surrounding states.After his father retired, Gooding took over as owner and chief executive officer. However, his tenure only lasted from  to  when, aged , he decided to sell the company back to the parent corporation.The move brought him a fortune ndash his wealth was rumoured to be in the region of  million.And what better way to celebrate than with a dram or two However, nipping to his local Walmart was not going to bring Richard Gooding the liquid treasures he sought.His personal pilot, a silver-haired chap called Kirk with a bushy white moustache, recalls frequent jaunts across the Atlantic with Gooding in search of single malt whiskies.Speaking in a video produced for the Perthshire company organising the sale of Goodingrsquos collection, Whisky Auctioneers, he offers a fascinating insight into the lestyle that money can bring.ldquoWe went to Ireland, Scotland,  or  trips specically for auctions for purchasing whisky, he says.ldquoWe pulled up to Talisker and just knocked on the door. People answered and they gave us tours. It was before all the tasting rooms were open and all the displays and stuff like that.ldquoHe would go to Macallan and start taking to the people, saying lsquoOkay, I would like to have this one and this and that one and that onersquo.ldquoAnd they are looking at him and saying, lsquoDo you want this, or this rsquo And he would say lsquoI want them all!rsquo.ldquoHe was into the whisky business long before it became as popular as it is today, he adds.ldquoHe tasted a lot of them when we were on these trips, but the majority of his purpose was to have a collection of one of everything that was ever made.ldquoThe lsquoperfect collectionrsquo.Gooding, with a self-taught knowledge of whisky and very deep pockets, enjoyed a warm welcome at distilleries which were still to witness the global explosion in whisky collecting that exists today.ldquoIt was a golden age when you could find an incredible array of bottles, adds MacRaild.ldquoApparently he just turned up and bought stuff. He would go around Speyside with his driver and stop off at distilleries to see what was interesting.ldquoHe would go to Gordon  MacPhail, the whisky specialist shop in Elgin which had incredible stocks, and fill his boots.Gooding bought at the perfect time ndash many of the bottles he acquired  years ago for a few hundred pounds are now worth several thousands.ldquoRichardrsquos mission was to collect a bottle that represented every single distillery, said his we Nancy, who he had met at high school in Denver.Perhaps she was too busy enjoying her collection of horses to pay much attention to her husbandrsquos wood-led cellar, groaning with bottles and where he would happily consume parts of his collection at the bar.ldquoHe opened a lot of bottles with his friends, says MacRaild, who has helped to catalogue the collection for the auction sale.ldquoYou would find a fairly standard bottle of whisky that would have cost maybe  or  sitting next to a bottle that was worth ,.Yet, perhaps strangely for a man who built one of the worldrsquos most impressive whisky collections, his lersquos passion is absent from the obituary in the Denver Post following his death at the age of  after an -year struggle with melanoma.Described as a ldquoquiet and generous philanthropist who did not enjoy the limelight, among his interests ndash aviation, boat design, architecture, music, language, food and travel ndash whisky does not get a mention.ldquoHe was a person who enjoyed the concept of design, his obituary adds, perhaps an explanation for those remarkable wooden shelves, heaving with bottles of ious shapes, some with artistically designed labels, others strikingly plain, such as the most expensive of the current lot, that  Macallan Fine and Rare -year-old And like that perfectly arranged collection, he took pride in presentation: he didnrsquot do ldquodressing down, preferring a well-cut suit worn with a carefully-chosen shirt ndash he would always wear pink on a Wednesday as a tribute to all fighting breast cancer.His colourful collections of shirts were matched by one of his ldquosignature Leonard Paris silk ties.ldquoHis collection of ties has to be record-setting for quantity and iety, his obituary adds.Of course, ties are not what Richard Gooding is now known for.Experts who have sted through his whisky collection have described it as one of the most exciting discoveries of the whisky world. Itrsquos ldquojaw-dropping, ldquonothing short of overwhelming, ldquoeclectic and ldquopeerless, they say.Yet MacRaild says Richard Gooding was probably no dferent to the rest of us.He simply loved a dram.ldquoOnce you are bitten by the Scotch bug, thatrsquos it for le.

The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year before , and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today.This is an incredibly rare example, bottled under the Largiemeanoch label, a brand devised for a series of private bottlings for The Howgate Wine Co in Edinburgh in the late s.A legendary bottle of whisky, distilled at Bowmore in  and bottled from a vatting of three sherry casks. A -year-old was also bottled.Glenlivet Liqueur Scotch Mayor, Sworder and Co circa sThis was bottled by Mayor, Sworder  Co, a fine wine merchant from London. Up until the mid-s, the company also had many dealings in spirits, bottling whisky and gin. The firm contracted blends from Bulloch Lade, but also produced its own label called Red Monogram.It regularly received fillings of Glenlivet and Ardbeg for its production, and in earlier years, sought-after Longmorn malt as well. These casks would occasionally be bottled as single malts for the companys more discerning customers, as was the case here. Its Glenlivet was often pre-vatted for blending purposes, so bottled as a single malt here with an undiscernible vintage or age statement. This was bottled at some point in the early s.The early reverence for this now iconic Speyside distillery is clear in the wax dipping of these bottle tops, a practice the firm usually reserved for its high-end vintage port.Glenfiddich  Peter J RussellGlenfiddich was an early advocate of the single malt Scotch category, and its faith is rewarded today by being one of the best-selling Scotch brands in the world. It became the first distillery to market its single malt brand in , and was the first to open its facility to visitors. Glenfiddich was an important trailblazer in the whisky industry, whose contribution cannot be forgotten. The scale of its operation today is a testament to this.This is a spectacular example of one of the distillerys early single malts, bottled here especially for Peter J Russell  Co in Edinburgh.Pre-war vintages in single malt are exceptionally rare, particularly from distilleries like Glenfiddich.

Although very popular, Longrow remains an elusive whisky, with only - casks of it filled at the distillery each year. Early champions of this spirit included the legendary Italian bottler, Silvano Samaroli, who bought and bottled a number of famous casks from the inaugural vintage, and is credited by many with a good deal of the brands success.

Now they are trying to ensure that people are fit and in shape to head back to the hills when restrictions ease.Through their development arm ClimbScotland, which is a programme by Mountaineering Scotland to help inspire people of all ages and abilities to get involved in climbing, both indoors and outdoors, they have been trying to keep enthusiasts engaged during lockdownWith members of Mountaineering Scotland and Climb Scotland craving ways of keeping fit in preparation for ing to climbing when lockdown ends, Jamie Smith, development manager for ClimbScotland, said they started to look at ways they could offer advice and came up with the idea of #Quarantraining. A number people have been posting their own activities on the Facebook page showing the kinds of activities they have been doing.He added: ldquoPeople were wanting to know what they could do and that is when we came up with the idea of quarantraining. We have a programme which involves a daily word and people can do exercises linked to each letter of a word we post on social media. We have YouTube videos which show how you can keep fit while doing everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea.Already Climb Scotland is thinking ahead to the days after lockdown.Mr Smith added: ldquoWe are having conversations about that at the moment and I think there will be need to be a phased approach. Anyto climbing or hillwalking will have to be done gradually and safely. If you have had a month or two off from climbing, you are not going to be as fit and have the same strength back immediately. Finger strength is very important for a climber and that can be one of the first injuries when people make a comeback as it needs to be done gradually.ldquoWe have to make sure that peopleto the sport safely. If you have had a break from any sport you need to ease back into it and mountaineering is no dferent.ldquoGiven that people have been in lockdown, it many well spark interest from newcomers to the activity as I am sure people will want to get outdoors and enjoy Scotlandrsquos beauty.* Shops across Scotland are closing.

We all have habits that we perform every single day, we make cups of tea, we brush our teeth, we have a glass of water. What I want to show you is a way we can take advantage of these current habits, to make new habits. So, letrsquos take my example of drinking tea.While Irsquom waiting for my tea to brew, I can practice doing push ups. Over time doing push-ups will become a new habit attached on to my old habit of making tea.PracticeThe next point is, I would like you to think of these exercises as practice not training. In training itrsquos easy to get bogged down by sets and reps but these are not important for practice. In practice, we arenrsquot concentrating on how many reps we can do but rather on the movement itself.Practice is as much about increasing our own body awareness as it is about performing the exercise. Try and do these exercises slowly and with focus. Ask yourself questions like, where am I generating tension in my body now If yoursquore struggling to focus as the exercise is too easy or too hard, each video will show you some iations that you may find easier or harder.FormThe last point I want to talk about is Form.No-onersquos form is perfect when theyrsquore starting out with a new exercise. We all find it dficult doing something new, so donrsquot beat yourself up about it and more importantly donrsquot give up in frustration.Dficulty gives an opportunity to improve.In each of the videorsquos wersquoll give you some pointers to help improve your form. We need feedback in order to make adjustments to improve this form. We can do this using body awareness like I mentioned earlier but it can also be useful to video ourselves doing these exercises, to seewe can spot any issues.So there you have it, three things to keep in mind when doing these exercises:Use old habits to create new habits these exercises are an opportunity to practice movement form takes time and practice to develop.* Shops across Scotland are closing.

The internet means access to sophisticated online archives is only a mouse click away and there are scores of websites offering advice to those hoping to discover their inner Sherlock Holmes.It all makes genealogy ndash and historical research more generally ndash ideal for locked-down Scots seeking mental stimulation at home.The premises of institutions such as the National Library and National Records of Scotland might be shut but thatrsquos no barrier when information can be obtained instantly and from anywhere. Even more importantly, much of it is free.Researching your family treeThere has over the last two decades been an explosion in the range and richness of online content available to those looking to find out more about their ancestors. Public interest in family history has grown just as rapidly.The ScotlandsPeople Centre in Edinburgh , part of the National Records of Scotland, provides online access to births, marriages and deaths, as well as wills, census documents, Coats of Arms and valuation rolls.Fees are charged for viewing some items but, explains Iain Ferguson, Centre Manager, the entire operation has been designed to maximise speed and ease of use.ldquoInstead of the olden days when you had to come in, we now have digitised museum records, he says. ldquoYou just type in a name and year, and the system can search for it in an instant. And you have the opportunity to look up images of records.Of course, the online quest to trace a family tree doesnrsquot have to be limited to big national organisations.Independent websites can also offer a vital helping hand. FindMyPast , one of the largest and best known, gives armchair genealogists access to billions of records and its archive is expanding all the time. Late last year, it announced a new online collection spanning nearly five centuries of Dundee and Angus history. The materials provide names, dates, residences and occupations, as well as photographic documents of streets and people. Many are full colour scans from paper originals.Technology and a certain BBC TV show, says Mr Ferguson, have combined to turbo-charge the popularity of genealogy as a hobby ndash and therersquos no sign of a slowdown.ldquoI would say there has been growth in the number of people being interested in family history, certainly, particularly around ten years ago, when Who Do You Think You Are was on television, he adds.ldquoAnd, as time has progressed, more and more records have been put up by family history societies and so on. People are far more keen. They have a thirst for knowledge.Itrsquos good to talkWhile technology undoubtedly supports the task of discovering an ancestor or their involvement in a major historical event, theres no substitute for conversation with family when it comes to unearthing the most exciting clues.Grandparents, aunts, uncles and, of course, mum and dad should all be among the first ports of call. Even older siblings and cousins can helpelderly relatives have passed away. And video chat apps mean the coronavirus lockdown is no obstacle to enjoying quality, face-to-face contact.ldquoTalking to your family is hugely important, says Tahitia McCabe, Genealogical Studies Postgraduate Programme Course Director at the University of Strathclyde.ldquoItrsquos the way you get the juicy bits - the stories and all the interesting stuff. Genealogy is about bringing history, people and places to le.ldquoThe official records donrsquot tell you the lsquowhyrsquo. They can only really capture the interface with governments and organisations, all the formal things that happen in your le. But there are lots of things that happen that donrsquot get captured in a formal way.Moving the focus of genealogy beyond official records and on to real human relationships is crucial to its wider appeal, says Ms McCabe, adding that the number of people under  attending her courses is definitely ldquocreeping up.The broader pictureAn accurate record of inidual events is vital but so is context - and few institutions are better equipped to provide this than the National Library of Scotland .Its huge multi-media archiveis a gold mine for digital genealogists and historians of all ages, particularly those seeking information about ancestors caught up in the two world wars.Lists of officers enrolled in the army, navy and air force, and an extensive collection of black-and-white photographs from the Western Front, are available free of charge. Also on offer are clan histories, maps and a moving image archive containing footage from communities across the country. Lucy Church, NLS reference services assistant, says such resources are vital for adding a social dimension to the raw information set out in documents such as birth, marriage and death certicates.ldquoPeople use [our collection] to find out about specic iniduals but what itrsquos best for is the bigger picture ndash social and local history, for example, she adds.ldquoWhat we have available has vastly increased in recent years. Since the internet has been available, the archiving world has really engaged with it - and how we can provide a service through it.Stressing that staff are always on hand to assist home users in dficulty, she says: ldquoIf you think of institutions like ourselves, the National Museum of Scotland, National Records ndash they all have really excellent websites. The best way [for people] to familiarise themselves with the collection is to have a look and just be guided by what their particular interest is.Parents in particular will find Scotlandrsquos major cultural institutions invaluable when theyre trying to keep children busy. The NLS website features a wide-ranging learning zone with materials about topics such as the womenrsquos suffrage movement.The Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust, meanwhile, has created dedicated online resourceswhich its leaders hope will inspire youngsters to create prose, poetry and art about Bonnie Prince Charliersquos famous victory in  over a government army led by Sir John Cope. Entries will be published online and organisers hope to include as many as possible in a special commemorative book to mark the battlersquos th anniversary.Also offering online home schooling assistance is the National Wallace Monument, which has launched a video series to help young people learn about William Wallace and the Wars of Scottish Independence. Available at www.nationalwallacemonument, it is aimed at children aged between  and  who are encouraged to watch the videos and answer questions based on the content.Catherine Morrison, Learning and Volunteer Co-ordinator at Stirling District Tourism, says: ldquoUsually, Irsquom hosting trips for school children at the Monument, or visiting schools to teach them all about William Wallace. These are things wersquore not currently able to do, but we wanted to do something to support parents and keep their children learning about history.Sidebar ndash top tips for the budding genealogist Start with what you know. Begin by writing down everything you know about your family ndash names, dates of birth, places of residence. Evenall you have are rough dates and more questions than answers, itrsquos a place to launch your project. Talk to your family ndash do this sooner rather than later. If elderly relatives have all passed away, try older siblings or cousins. Search official records. Generally, yoursquoll want to try and obtain birth, marriage and death information for your ancestors and anyone  on your tree that is of interest. Plus, finding them on available census records is of primary importance. Itrsquos best to start as close to the present as possible and work your way back. That way you can usually very facts with your memories and records, or by checking with other family members. Once you have built up your skills, keep going!

Unlike in England which limits the number of dogs which can be used to just two, there is no limit to numbers in Scotland.According to anti-bloodsport campaigners, a lack of clarity in the law has opened the door to the risk of hunts continuing to use packs of dogs, raising concerns that foxhunting with hounds is continuing in all but name.Police Scotland has also previously suggested that the law banning fox hunting in Scotland is unworkable and creates a level of confusion which can deflect from the spirit of the law.Moves to strengthen the law which were to be included in forthcoming Scottish Parliament business have now been put on hold as a result of the current health crisis.Campaigners are now calling for political parties to enshrine a change in foxhunting legislation in their manestos for next yearrsquos Scottish Parliament elections.The League Against Cruel Sports say they filmed incidents at the JedForest hunt at Jedburgh and the Duke of Buccleuch hunt near Eccles in the Scottish Borders.Footage captured on  December during the JedForest hunt appears to show a pack of hounds on the scent of a fox. The charity says it believes the JedForest Hunt was encouraging its hounds to search for and chase foxes.Steven Irvine, Police Scotland Wildle and Enviromental Crime Officer said: ldquoOn Tuesday,  December, , a complaint was made to police about a fox hunt in the Jedburgh area. Our enquiries are continuing into this matter.In the second film also involving the JedForest hunt on March  this year, a fox is seen bolting after it was dug out from underground. The hunt then attempts a gunshot before the pack of hounds chases down the fox.In the final clip, a huntsman from the Buccleuch hunt is seen throwing a dead fox into a pack of hounds near Eccles in the Scottish Borders. The incident took place during the hunt on March .In both cases, the films were shared with police however, no crime was established in either case.Robbie Marsland, Director of the League Against Cruel Sports, Scotland said: ldquoWe believe the law does not work. For the last five years we have been filming Scottish hunts and looking for patterns of behaviour.ldquoThey say they are shooting foxes, but in the first year we didnrsquot see a single gun. When they knew we were filming them, guns started to appear.They would be held up in an ostentatious manner.ldquoEvery hunt we saw looked to us like a tradition hunt looked before the ban except occasionally a man would be standing there with a gun.ldquoHunts often come up with a way of protecting themselves and for the police to say they donrsquot think itrsquos possible for a prosecution.Campaigners want new legislation which would reduce the number of dogs used during a hunt to just two, and a clause that would outlaw the practice of laying a fox scent for hounds to follow ndash known as trail hunting. Popular in England, there are concerns that it can lead to hounds confusing scent baits with live animals.Countryside Alliance Director Jamie Stewart criticised the campaignersrsquo methods and insisted hunts in Scotland were abiding by the law.ldquoOnce again the LACs have reverted to the deceitful practice of hiding in bushes and using heavily edited footage to suggest illegal practices in an attempt to deceive the general public and to try and influence politicians.He added: ldquoScottish Mounted Fox hound packs operate a legal pest control service to comply with the Protection of Wild MammalsAct .ldquoThe impact of fox predation on livestock, red-listed, and other vulnerable, ground-nesting birds is well-documented.ldquoIn addition to this, scientic research tells us that foxes could be responsible for the savage death of up to , lambs in Scotland every year.

Indeed, some estimates suggest the extra shared cost for the UK could be around pound trillion, which would increase the national debt by  per cent.Basically, this means that there has been a signicant \"material change\" in Scotlands financial position since the last SNP conference when all sorts of fancul promises were made about establishing our own currency and so on. Compounding the problem for an independent Scotland has been the crash in oil prices, which at the current level would produce little or no tax revenues. Furthermore, there are serious isions opening up in the EU with key politicians in Italy and Spain calling for \"common debt\" , otherwise the \"very existence\" of the EU would be at stake.Taking the above into consideration there are now no credible commentators left who believe there is the slightest chance that Scotland could leave the UK or that it would be in our interests to join a ided EU. Perhaps it is now time for Ms Sturgeon to be honest with her followers and explain that there has indeed been a \"material change\", but this time it means they need to accept the cost of leaving the UK is too great for at least a \"generation\" or more to come.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.I FOUND much to agree with in Doug Maughan and Iain Millars lettersabout Labour and its new leadership. In fact,when I read Neil Findlays letterI started to write a reply which began \"Well, thatdidnt last long\".It showed the enormity ndash impossibility, Im beginning to think ndash of the task, and the stupidity and pigheadedness of the people Jackie Bailie, Ian Murray and Sir Keir Starmer are up against.Ive spoken to many Labour supporters, including an MSP, whose needles are stuck in the groove that the SNP wedged them into, marked \"you lost in Scotland because you sided with the Tories in \".No they didnt, they squandered the huge thanks and goodwill of two million No voters by failing to unite in their opposition to Indyref and come up with the leadership and policies to win any of the subsequent elections indeed, as Mr Millar quotes, democratically \"ridding Scotland\" of its SNP Government.And now this capitulation into federalism or more devolution appeasement, an unworkable approachthat was theme of a frustrating speech by Gordon Brown, one of my heroes of , at the recent These Island conference.For all the economic, social, security, Covid, and Brexit reasons that are regularly aired in these columns I disagree with the conclusion that independence is the answer. In fact, Im one of a growing number who think devolution has failed and should be morphed into something more agile and effective.Reduce the bloated  MP and MSP count to  talented MPs, boost the Scottish Offices power in Westminster and power in Scotland by having ministers in political charge of the main devolved departments and a civil service immune to the bullying and patronage that seems to have infected Holyrood.And get behind Andy Burnhams City Region vision that is working so well in Manchester.I have heard it explained at These Islands and a conference run by Aberdeen City and Shire, whose administrations, frustrated by SNP centralised, back the idea.Scottish Labour leaders could do worse than pay a visit to Aberdeen, see how effectively the joint Labour and Conservative administrations are working, copy their ideas and reverse the bulky, vindictive suspension of its Labour group.There is a long way to go.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.IF the Scottish Labour Party is serious about trying to regain lost ground, and to provide a credible opposition to the SNP, it must get rid of its current ineffectual leader, who has been a complete disaster. As a floating voter, I feel a team of Jackie Baillie and Anas Sarwar might just begin to appeal as an alternative, provided the party can overcome what appears to be its many prejudices.John N E Rankin, Bridge of Allan.Shops across Scotland are closing.

These teachers have had their normal ways of working turned upside down overnight and are working extremely hard to support learning for all. This includes taking advantage of online tools where possible and seeking to provide hard copy materials where it isnt.

We are to ldquoreact equally selflessly  I would never ever dispute the extreme hard work, dedication and selflessness of our NHS heroes and key workers across the country. To me, however, this statement insinuates that teachers across the country are not already doing this. Whilst I canrsquot speak for all schools in the UK, my colleagues and I have all, where possible, willingly volunteered to care for children of key workers, putting ourselves at risk each time we enter the school building and increasing our chances of contracting Covid-.On top of that, in the two weeks prior to the holidays as well as the days leading up to the school closures, my colleagues and I worked tirelessly to develop an online learning . Trying to change your practice in that short timeframe is a challenge, I assure you.We spent those two weeks, hours in front of the computer, planning, implementing and marking work, responding to parent queries and questions and sending videos and messages of support and encouragement to our naturally worried pupils.We are now in our school holidays so naturally this is to be a time for rest and recuperation. Not quite ndash we have continued to volunteer our time to be in school, again looking after pupils where families need us most. I couldnrsquot be prouder to support them. Next week, I will have to open my forward plan, film videos and create resources for my pupils ing to ldquoremote learning after the holidays.Next time, Mr Marr ought to show a little consideration for those actually working at the class level just now, who are making the most out of a trying and dficult time for all schools up and down the country.Sacha Taylor, class teacher, Glasgow.Shops across Scotland are closing.

As of last week, the expert teachers that Ms Benedetti has recruited to her cause for the live workshops have been sharing those skills via the internet with daily lessons.As well as Ms Benedettirsquos own thrice-weekly ldquoLive at Five lessons and discussions on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays via the YouTube, Facebook and Instagram s, sessions have included rhythm games with percussionist Elsa Bradley on Monday, double bassist Stewart Wilsonrsquos practice tips on Tuesday, Fe Youth Jazz Orchestra founder Richard Michael explaining improvisation on Wednesday, violin for beginners with Rachel Cooper on Thursday and Lucinda Geoghegan, whose Kodaly-method training is the basis of the success of the National Youth Choir of Scotland, leading a singing session on Friday.

I canrsquot wait!The Benedetti Foundation has made resources available to help young violinists join in the project. Sheet music for Salut drsquoAmour can be downloaded free from the website, where there are performances by the violinist to play along with as well as by her accompanist Petr Limonov alone, so that the student can be the soloist. Ms Benedettirsquos own performance with Mr Limonov will be released as a digital single by Deccaon Friday April .Nicola Benedettirsquos initiative, and the wider work of her foundation, is only part of a huge transfer of music-teaching resources to online formats as a result of the Covid- crisis.

Each year, the event attracts a stellar line-up of altruistic, empathetic figures in business who wish to tackle shared challenges ndash people like HeySummit CEO Robert Gelb, who believes values and purpose will become the primary focus for all businesses in the future.ldquoIrsquove been involved with Impact Summit from very early on and I am a huge champion of it.

We create their landing pages, look after speaker accounts, manage attendees and help everyone pick and manage their schedules.ldquoWersquore very hands-on and want attendees and participants to all have a special, bespoke experience that is highly informative, worthwhile and also a pleasant experience.Despite global broadband networks being currently overloaded and specic servers hosting conferencing s heavy with activity, Gelb is confident that the popular Impact Summit will not fall foul of any technical gremlins on the day.ldquoThe mainstream mediarsquos current criticism of the security of s such as Zoom are wildly over-hyped and mainly based on users not being aware that they can alter settings. These providers have to balance ease of use against locking the whole thing down and I think they do it rather well.ldquoWe have hosted thousands of conferences over the past few years and we are proud of our reputation for stability and fluidity for attendees. It really will be a great experience and we know how to pull it off smoothly.ldquoImpact Summit is a huge, ambitious event and the sky is the limit for what it can achieve in Scotland and even further afield.

So in that interim period, s like HeySummit will certainly perform well as people seek to adapt to their own circumstances and monetise their specialisms in new ways.ldquoEntrepreneurs and firms will all be looking for solutions to staying visible, focused and to generate revenue. Many are clearly looking to ersy income due to the current crisis and thatrsquos where we come in.ldquoVirtual summits, conferences and workshops are great ways of monetising networks, contacts and developing new angles to business.

It is anticipated that a more detailed briefing on how these are progressing # whether they are to be extended by a specicof time or relaxed in any way # may be given at the beginning of next week.Mr Raab, who is currently deputising for hospitalised Prime Minister Boris Johnson, also warned the public against disobeying the current guidance over the Easter weekend # a time which folk would normally take trips with  extended family and friends.This follows an announcement by the Scottish Government, today that total of  people in Scotland have died with coronavirus.

If someone is threatened by cattle, they are encouraged to release your dog and take the shortest route out of the field. As always pick up and remove all waste. A government spokesman said: #This is a temporary situation and it is more important now than ever to maintain good relationships between neighbours and within communities. This is not about restricting the general right of responsible non-motorised access to land but it is part of the wider approach to prevent COVID- deaths and preserving the nation’s food supplies.#Exercising access rights responsibly means respecting the needs of other people, and you will need to adapt your behaviour accordingly in the national effort to contain the spread of COVID-. Land managers should respect access rights, which are particularly important at this dficult time. If necessary, use helpful signs to highlight issues to users and suggest reasonable alternative routes.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward. He had to pay my dental bill and a £ fine. Torquil Mackenzie # a name I will take to my grave!” “I can#t remember how far back it was but it was a while ago — it was a cup final up in Uig against Portree. The game went to extra-time # we had Bruce Neil and Paul Flynn sent off but ended up winning something like -.“I remember John ‘Spod# Macleod scoring a goal and running up the touchline with his hands cupped over his ears to the once noisy Portree support who had given him dogs# abuse during the game. That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management.

The money is intended to help ease cash flow pressures as the sector suffers the catastrophic economic impact of coronavirus.But on what would have been the start of the summer season, businesses have seen their tourism income drop to zero and are desperately trying to keep afloat until the scheme goes live.NITA chief executive Joanne Stuart called for interim payments to tide firms over.We are now pleading with banks and other financial institutions to work with the industry as they wait to submit business critical applications, she said. Jobs are being shed now, cancellations have already happened, businesses are ready to close now. The Assembly needs to make interim payments nowthese businesses and jobs are to survive.Firms are struggling to meet upfront staffing costs as they await the implementation of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, and were relying on the grant scheme to fill the gap in funding.This meant we would have had an interim cash flow that would have plugged the gap until the furlough scheme went live, added Ms Stuart.However, as the grants have not been distributed, businesses may not be able to survive until the end of April much less start making grant applications.In the absence of immediate cash flow relief, the NITA said companies and jobs will be lost ahead of the scheme#s implementation.The tourism industry will be an important part of our economic recovery once we start to see restrictions lted and the impact of the virus receding, it said. We need to ensure tourism businesses survive through these unprecedented circumstances and be in a position to provide a future for staff and deliver for the economy.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is when Northern Ireland needs to be getting creative, getting ready to attract visitors later this year when so many people starved of their holidays will be looking for somewhere to go.I look at the industry here, and have done for many years, and see a fractured industry that#s simply not making the best of what#s on offer across the whole island of Ireland.Stephanie, here with her husband and programme producer Mark, had planned to fly from Dublin for Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, on March .But with planes grounded just a couple of days before her departure date, any hopes of making it back to her home town of Lanesborough in Massachusetts were dashed. Instead, she has found her ideal home from home at Corner Cottage in Cairncastle, courtesy of Tim Campbell, the director of the Saint Patrick Centre in Co Down.It looks like we#ll be here until July at the earliest, possibly even September the way things are going in America, she added.In a lot of respects we#re lucky to be here.

Government measures to reduce the spread of the Covid  virus by limiting when the public can leave their home has led to an increase in walkers in local parks, greenways and public footpaths and with it more dog foul for Councils Cleansing teams to clean up. googletag.cmd.push Mayor Boyle urged dog owners to show respect for public health and other parks and greenway users when walking their pets. The vast majority of dog owners are conscientious and clean up after their dogs but there has been a noted increase in fouling since the new stay at home measures were introduced,” she said. Dog excrement left on our streets and parks poses a serious public health hazard and is putting extra pressure on our Cleansing team at this dficult time.  I would appeal to all owners to carry a bag to lt the dirt and dispose ofit in a designated dog bin where possible or in a black bin. googletag.cmd.push “Similarly, owners are reminded that when in designated pedestrian zones, dogs must be on a lead held by someone who is able to control it and owners should be mindful of other dogs and members of the public who could be scared of animals.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in .

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus. You could just see everybody that was there...wanted to be there.” Away from the fun, there was also an appetite for work. Manager Kevin McNaughton had enlisted fitness coach Malcolm McCausland. No longer was it running laps til you boked. “He would take us up to do sprints and he gave us a programme of what to do ourselves,” Mullan points out. Going into the Ulster final, Derry were perfectly poised. They had ran Antrim to three points two years previously, had a strong league campaign under their belt and were convincing semi-final winners over Down. Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals. With an Ulster title in the bag, the duo ramped up the preparations even more. “Training wouldve involved a lot of shorter games...they had everything speeded up and closed in. The training matches were faster, there was no time - you just got the ball and got it away. “I remember that everybodys hurling was good at that time and you got used to the speed the big boys played at, thats what they concentrated on.” It was time to take their hurling to the biggest stage of all. *** Adrian Logan was deployed to Derry to get a taste of the new hurling revolution and arrived at Younger Homes in Maghera. It was the week of the new Ulster champions baptism against All-Ireland contenders Offaly in the Croker cauldron and Niall Mullan was the interviewee. “I remember telling him that theyknew absolutely nothing about us and we knew who they were. I thought that was an advantage and we were going to throw the kitchen sink at them.” Derry travelled south the day before the game and stayed out of Dublin. Everything was relaxed. During the week, the squad were flying at training. The scene was set. Sitting in the dressing room, Niall Mullan was conscious it could be his last game with the famous Oakleaf badge on his chest. “Collie McGurk was , Conor Murray was  and I was ,” Mullan now jokes. “So thats over  combined years, so there were no speed merchants.” As the team togged out, Mullan noticed the usual nerves werent present. He was taking it all in his stride. “I was walking about...thinking Ill beoff after  minutes or I will play well. Thats just how I felt.” “Collie would always talk in the changing room and he was telling us lets get wired into these b******s, there would always be some of the players chipping in.” From the win over Antrim, the management had some reshuffling to do. Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus. You could just see everybody that was there...wanted to be there.” Away from the fun, there was also an appetite for work. Manager Kevin McNaughton had enlisted fitness coach Malcolm McCausland. No longer was it running laps til you boked. “He would take us up to do sprints and he gave us a programme of what to do ourselves,” Mullan points out. Going into the Ulster final, Derry were perfectly poised. They had ran Antrim to three points two years previously, had a strong league campaign under their belt and were convincing semi-final winners over Down. Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals. With an Ulster title in the bag, the duo ramped up the preparations even more. “Training wouldve involved a lot of shorter games...they had everything speeded up and closed in. The training matches were faster, there was no time - you just got the ball and got it away. “I remember that everybodys hurling was good at that time and you got used to the speed the big boys played at, thats what they concentrated on.” It was time to take their hurling to the biggest stage of all. *** Adrian Logan was deployed to Derry to get a taste of the new hurling revolution and arrived at Younger Homes in Maghera. It was the week of the new Ulster champions baptism against All-Ireland contenders Offaly in the Croker cauldron and Niall Mullan was the interviewee. “I remember telling him that theyknew absolutely nothing about us and we knew who they were. I thought that was an advantage and we were going to throw the kitchen sink at them.” Derry travelled south the day before the game and stayed out of Dublin. Everything was relaxed.

Bishop McKeown visited the cemetery at dawn to sprinkle graves using Easter Water that was blessed in St Eugene’s Cathedral during the Easter Vigil Mass on Saturday night. The visit was arranged in co-operation with Derry City and Strabane District Council. Bishop McKeown said he hoped the Easter Blessing would bring some comfort to grieving families across the Derry Diocese who are unable to visit the graves of their loved ones. He said he was very aware that the government legislation that forced all cemeteries and burial grounds to close for visitors, was a dficult one for many people, but he urged the public to be mindful of their own health and welfare and to take heed of the government advice to Stay at Home. googletag.cmd.push He urged people to have faith and to remember their loved ones through prayer and reflection and encouraged the public to care for one another during this dficult time. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see. It can get really emotional as there are now family members turning up to wave and talk to their relatives through windows while I sing.ldquoItrsquos heartfelt to see their enjoyment at being able to connect with their parents or grandparents inside. It can be heart-breaking at times but itrsquos still nice to see it.ldquoI have been told by some of the carers that they have seen some patients with dementia sing along to the music and thatrsquos also really good to know.A former soloist with St Patrickrsquos Church in Ballynahinch and ex-pupil of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College, Wayne ensures he keeps the residents and carers safe at all times.A long extension power lead from the home is laid for him before he arrives so he can plug in his mixing desk, microphone and laptop.Wayne said: ldquoItrsquos sterilised before I get it and when I had it back itrsquos sterilised again so I have no direct contact with anyone in the home.ldquoI try not to sing beyond  minutes as the homes often open the windows to allow residents to hear better and Irsquom conscious of not wanting anyone to get too cold in the process.Wayne started off singing at a Magherafelt nursing home when a pub owner hersquos friendly with was approached by the home asking for suggestions at how they could entertain the residents.He added: ldquoThe residents in the home loved it and asked me to come back again so I did and then I got calls from other homes.He now has nine performances under his belt with the help of his brother-in-law, former Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin, and his sister, Michelle, who runs Paddy Kellyrsquos Bar in Ballynahinch.Wayne, whose parents Maurice and Naveen still live in Ballynahinch, has been a show band singer for years and once performed with the legendary Sunshine.Gigs for his wedding band, The All Stars, have been cancelled or postponed as couples were force to rebook their wedding dates.Wayne is performing free of charge and says he is happy to as it gives him some focus in his le at this time.ldquoI donrsquot have much  to do as work has stopped, but I do feel a lot better knowing that Irsquom bringing some happiness to others, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Binmen.jpg","title":"Binmen receiving thank you messages for essential work  ","story":"THE districtrsquos binmen have been thanked for continuing to provide collection services during the coronavirus pandemic.Some people have been pasting messages on their bins thanking the men for the job they are doing, while their efforts have also been commended by Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Working in extremely dficult circumstances, the binmen are providing a critical service at this time and their efforts have not gone unnoticed by ratepayers who taking time to wipe the handles of their bins with disinfectant before they are collected to help keep refuse staff safe.Householders are also being reminded to ensure that they continue to place the correct waste in the right bin to help ease the burden on public health services to help stop additional risks to staff who are working under increasing pressure.Refuse collection staff have been singled out for particular praise as they collect and transport waste, with their work also helping to protect the environment.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots said the materials refuse staff collect for processing such as cardboard, plastic and glass are vital resources in package production across the food and retail sectors, explaining that ain recycling could impact on the supply chain ing effectively.He added: ldquoAll those working in the waste sector are key workers and I have also established a COVID- Waste Group to provide support, guidance and regulatory direction to the waste sector.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which recently closed all its household recycling centres to redeploy staff to work in refuse collection mdash said that all bin collections continue as normal.However, residents are asked to provide additional help by ensuring that bins are put out for collection no later than am every morning or the night before.Where possible, residents are asked not to restrict bin lorry access and park as considerately as possible. Over recent weeks, binmen have experienced issues accessing homes in a number of areas including Ballynahinch and Newcastle to collect bins.Residents are also asked to ensure that all bin handles are cleaned or wiped-down before and after use and not to approach refuse staff without following the minimum two-metre social distancing guidance.Commending refuse staff for the work they are doing in dficult circumstances, the council chairman explained that as the coronavirus crisis unfolded, the local authority was quick to implement a number of health and safety measures to protect staff.He explained that the measures allowed bin collection teams to continue the service with minimal disruptions to residents.ldquoCrews now operate staggered start times between .am and am and are authorised to leave work immediately upon the completion of their rounds, said Cllr Casey.ldquoTo support social distancing, crews are restricted to one driver and one loader in each cab. For crews that operate as one driver and two loaders, the loaders are transported behind the collection lorry in a support vehicle.ldquoLoaders are also asked to limit their time in cabs to an absolute minimum and can be collected and drop-off points along designated routes.Cllr Casey said the local authority is constantly reviewing its services in light of ldquorapidly changing events and may make further changes at very short notice.He said the current situation remains challenging and is dependent on the ongoing impact of COVID- on council employees.The chairman continued: ldquoWe would like to thank all our frontline workers who continue to engage with our residents to deliver essential services.ldquoI fully appreciate the disruption this has had on normal working routines. However, as a workforce and a wider-society we are now having to make signicant changes to our daily lives. I would also like to thank the public for their support and patience during very dficult circumstances.:Cllr Casey added: ldquoWith our household recycling centres now closed to free up resources needed to maintain domestic refuse collection services and help ensure compliance with social distancing guidance, we are appealing to people not to fly-tip and to do their bit to keep the district clean and safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 County.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre to be community hub  ","story":"DOWN Leisure Centre has been transformed into a new community co-ordination hub to ensure that vulnerable residents across the district receive essential supplies.Set up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the Downpatrick hub is one of three that have been established across the local authority areas.Others have opened in Kilkeel and Newry but the distribution centres are not open to members of the public or community groups.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hub which is to play a key role in delivering the service on the ground.Down Leisure Centre mdash which has been closed to the public for the past month as a result of global pandemic mdash has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required.When fully operational, over  leisure centre staff will be redeployed to work across all sites and work alongside others from across the organisation to help operate a lsquovirtualrsquo hub to coordinate the response.Staff training is currently underway for those who will be working in split shts at the centres while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The service was formally launched on Monday across the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas, with deliveries expected to centre on food supplies.In addition, a COVID- community helpline is already operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support can make contact between am and pm, seven days a week.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net.

He said that when Secretary of State Humphrey Atkins meets Eire Foreign Affairs spokesman Brian Lenihan in Dublin later this month, he should remember his Governmentrsquos pledge that the future of Northern Ireland was a matter for the people of Northern Ireland, her Majestyrsquos Government and the Parliament of the United Kingdom.Mr Beattie said Mr Lenihan should be warned that Loyalists would not tolerate interference by Eire in the internal affairs of Ulster in order to prop up the SDLP or in any SDLP proposals for power-sharing or a Council of Ireland.ldquoMr Atkins should take note we will never surrender to any pressure from Dublin or London that would hasten the arrival of a united Ireland.

More than pound was taken and police also found that the front door, which had been forced open, was badly damaged.They also said excrement was littered around the balcony and that someone had urinated in the building.STRANGFORD mdash The Strangford car ferry service experienced its busiest ever Easter period in its -year history. There was a marginal increase of  on last yearrsquos record total of , cars carried across, although the number of passengers using both ferries ped from , last year to ,.Inevitable delays developed in both Strangford and Portaferry as the two ferries tried to cope with the rush of motorists to the Ards Peninsula and Lecale coast.Easter Sunday was a particularly busy day for the ferry crew with , cars and , passengers being carried across mdash a considerable increase on last yearrsquos figures. Monday was again the busiest day of the year with a staggering , cars using the crossing and , passengers.The ferry superintendent, Mr Louis Fitzsimons, paid tribute to the work of police in Strangford in keeping traffic moving.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all.

To help overcome this a new mobile telephone number is available mdash  .Good Morning Down was established to help reduce loneliness and isolation. Volunteers also signpost those who need further support to other agencies.Good Morningrsquos Down service has never been more important. One of the charityrsquos volunteers, Aidan Harris, says the current climate represents a challenge for everyone, particularly those who live alone.ldquoThe staff moved out of our base at the business park over two weeks ago, but we are providing the service from our own homes and what we are doing is very much appreciated by those we contact every week, he explained.ldquoWe certainly are living in unprecedented times none of us have ever experienced anything like this in our letimes and hopefully will never do again.Aidan explained that while a lot of information people need to hear is circulated via social media, many elderly people do not have access to it. In the main, he said they are relying on the television and radio.ldquoWe are letting them know what is happening and reinforcing the message to stay indoors and not let anyone into their home, even their own relatives. We are highlighting the importance of them doing all that they can not to catch the virus, the charity volunteer continued.ldquoPeople are very concerned at what is going on and many of those whom we contact used to get out to attend ious clubs but they have all closed due to the pandemic which means the elderly and vulnerable are spending even longer alone in their homes.Aidan also revealed that some who normally received only one call a week are now getting several more, with people brought off the waiting list so they can be contacted.He also revealed that the charity is also providing the people they contact with details about local shops which are providing a delivery service.ldquoWe are emphasising the hand hygiene message as much as we can and reminding people to stay indoors. We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11245244.jpg","title":"latest figures reveal island trend","story":"Latest statistics show that in the Fermanagh and Omagh District region the number of positive cases rose to  with a total of  positive cases across Northern Ireland.Health Minister, Robin Swann explained that there is likely to be a second surge of the virus later in the year: ldquoEven then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le in Northern Ireland.

At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...However, the statement implied that Sinn Fein’s objection was on procedural grounds rather than because in principle it opposed any Army role. Ms O’Neill said that “we will not rule out any measure necessary to save lives” but added that Mr Swann “has a responsibility to exhaust all options, including the use of other blue light public services and civilian contractors, to ensure that ventilators and le saving equipment are moved swtly to where they are needed most”.In an interview with RTE on Saturday, Ms O’Neill said “we have to do everything necessary to save lives”, but then went on to say: “I don’t believe that British Army assistance is necessary at this point. I believe that all of our modelling indicates that we are coping, albeit in the most challenging of circumstances.”Three weeks ago in the Assembly Mr Swann said that his focus was on saving as many lives as possible and he would accept help from wherever it could be found.He told MLAs: “I’ll use whatever tool I have at my disposal to tackle this virus. If the Irish Army want to come up and help us too when they’ve it sorted down there, I’d be more than happy to welcome them.”DUP Agriculture and Environment Minister Edwin Poots said that Sinn Fein was not actually trying to stop the Army being involved, but accused it of a “silly PR stunt”.In a Facebook post on Saturday, Mr Poots said: “Michelle O’Neill would be better seeking a meeting with the republicans in her own constituency who entirely ignore social distancing than engaging in silly PR stunts about something she in reality has no intention of trying to stop.“Robin has my support in doing whatever needs done, however it is done, by whomever it is done.”With the exception of Sinn Fein, every other Executive party publicly endorsed Mr Swann’s attempt to secure support from the military in the battle against the pandemic.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said on Saturday: “Fteen people died of coronavirus overnight in the North. I’ll support anything that gets PPE and ventilators to where it needs to go. Let’s stop playing politics and do whatever it takes to save lives.”Responding to Mr Eastwood’s comments on Twitter, Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “Could not agree more. Robin Swann has my and the Alliance Party’s full support for taking extraordinary measures to try to save people’s lives. All and any help is welcome at this critical time.”First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster said: “Northern Ireland has been working together on tackling this awful disease. We need to keep at it.“When your loved one is lying in hospital, who built the ward will be the last thought on their mind. Let’s build the capacity we need. We fully support the Army being used to build necessary beds.”Ulster Unionist MLA and Royal Irish Regiment reservist Doug Beattie said that Sinn Fein’s rejection of help from the Army was “becoming absolutely tiresome”. He highlighted that the military had in recent weeks already been used by Stormont to create a temporary morgue, without objection from republicans.He added: “I guess few will complainpersonal protection equipment or ventilators are supplied via a military driver or a civilian driver orthe doctor and nurse treating them is military or not.”As in most countries battling the pandemic, the Army has been increasingly involved in the effort to assist health staff as they have become stretched.At the weekend the Ministry of Defence said that nearly  members of the armed forces are being loaned to NHS ambulance services to support their work.Personnel from all three strands of the armed forces will be sent to work at five ambulance trusts.Although their responsibilities will y depending on the area, the new duties will include driving ambulances and taking calls from the public.Eighty service personnel will be sent to the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust where they will drive emergency response vehicles, larger ambulances and work at the response centre which covers five counties around London.In London,  medical personnel from the armed forces will form  critical care transfer teams to transport patients who need to be moved between intensive care units.Engineers from the Army are also supporting the London Ambulance Service to maintain suction units used in ambulances.In Wales,  soldiers finished their two-day ambulance training at the Sennybridge Training Camp near Brecon on April , ready to be deployed across Wales to assist paramedics with non-clinical tasks.Thirty-seven military personnel have been deployed to the East of England Ambulance Service, which covers six counties including Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire, to assist with tasks including driving and logistics.The group all volunteer as emergency responders in their free time and have previously trained with the service.Members of the RAF are already assisting the Scottish Ambulance Service with a trial of a medical isolation and transport system, using RAF Puma helicopters to take critically ill people to hospital.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Our armed forces always step forward at the appearance of threats to the country and its people.“Across the United Kingdom, soldiers, sailors, airmen and women have got the backs of our NHS colleagues as they confront coronavirus.”Members of the armed forces have helped with the response to the outbreak in a iety of other ways.Military personnel were involved in the planning and building of the first NHS Nightingale hospital at the ExCel exhibition centre in east London, as well as its equivalents across the country.Armed forces personnel made up of  drivers and  driver’s mates have also been trained to fill and transport oxygen tankers to NHS facilities.The Ministry of Defence said there are hundreds of personnel delivering supplies of PPE for the NHS based at distribution centres across the country, amid reported shortages of the vital equipment.Speaking on Friday night, Mr Swann told this newspaper that he hoped the military request would not be isive, repeating his view that the only thing that will ide people in this pandemic is whether they live or die.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital

These communications are ongoing.“Prospective PPE supply routes from China for Northern Ireland have not been finalised.

The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
