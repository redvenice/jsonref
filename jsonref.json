Meghan wears some excellent clothes.One blogger wants everyone to know that size doesn’t cut you off from getting to inject some Markle into your wardrobe.Katie Sturino, founder of The 12ish Style blog and owner of the late, great Toast the dog, has teamed up with Ryan Dziadul, the founder of Extra Extra Style, to show that people of any size can recreate the excellent outfits worn by Meghan Markle and Prince Harry.As part of Katie’s #supersizethelook series, she and Ryan wore dupes of the royal couple’s outfits and recreated their poses – and looked brilliant.‘I started a series called Supersize The Look where I take celebrity looks and recreate them for a larger body size,’ Katie tells .‘The point is to show women who might feel like they can’t “pull off” a style they are inspired by because they are not the same size. You just have to put your confidence on first!’For Katie, hopping on the Meghan Markle effect is important, because seeing someone rocking the same style could give other women the confidence to love their bodies and wear whatever the f*** they want.‘I wish I had someone when I was growing up to look to for style inspiration that looked a little more like me,’ she explains.‘It would have saved me from many years of negative self talk about my body.‘I spent my teens and twenties punishing myself for not being “skinny”. I felt fat. All the time.‘I hated walking into crowded parties because I felt that everyone was thinking about how big I was.‘I fluctuated on the scale swinging between intense workouts and not even going to the gym. The moment I realized that there were other women out there that looked like me and had the same struggles as I did, I was freed in a way.‘Style has nothing to do with size!’Meghan’s not the only celeb Katie’s been copying.

Yesterday morning the European Court of Human Rights refused to intervene in the case.Speaking outside the hospital yesterday evening, Mr Evans: \u0027I\u0027m stood here now and Alfie is still here. Why? Because I\u0027m still fighting for him, I\u0027m still fighting and so is Alfie. I have been in touch with the Ambassador of Italy. My son belongs to Italy. I love Alfie and I love Kate, I will not give up.\u0027Around 100 people remained outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital awaiting news on Alfie Evans while a line of police officers guard the main entrance, with more police stationed at other entrances. Pope Francis said on Twitter: \u0027Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted.\u0027           Police attempt to keep protesters, one pushing a pram, out of the hospital\u0027s revolving door          Alfie Evans is in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition          Tom Evans pictured with the Pope, who has thrown renewed support behind the familyA source close to the Evans family said a UK judge would hold an urgent telephone conference with Italian legal representatives to discuss Alfie\u0027s plight.Alfie\u0027s father met the Pope last week to ask for asylum, kissing the pontiff\u0027s hand and begging him to \u0027save our son\u0027.The head of the Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, which is administered by the Vatican, also travelled to Liverpool in a bid to have the boy transferred, saying Pope Francis asked her to do everything \u0027possible and impossible\u0027 to save him.The hospital previously offered to help in the case of Charlie Gard, who died from a rare form of mitochondrial disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, including in his organs.One in four hospitals are refusing to perform C-sections to...Share this articleMr Evans\u0027s sister Sarah also emerged briefly from the hospital yesterday to tell supporters that Alfie\u0027s \u0027heartbroken\u0027 father was still inside the hospital.  Their case went before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) yesterday morning after it was rejected by the UK\u0027s Supreme Court, but judges in Strasbourg also refused to intervene, saying the application was \u0027inadmissible\u0027.Following the decision, around 200 people gathered outside Liverpool\u0027s Alder Hey hospital, as supporters blocked the road outside the hospital, linking arms and chanting, \u0027Save Alfie Evans!\u0027       Some of the protesters attempted to get into the hospital as police guarded the entrance          Some of the group surge towards are door after protesters tried to block a road to the hospitalDozens had ran towards the main doors before police officers stationed inside and out strung across the entrance blocking the way, and after after a short stand off the crowd retreated to gather around 100 yards away on the road outside. One woman described the crowd as \u0027terrifying\u0027, saying: \u0027Everyone just ran and were going for the doors, pushing police out of the way - but they weren\u0027t going to get in past the police. \u0027I understand people want to support Alfie and I\u0027ve got a lot of respect for people who want to support him but I\u0027ve got respect for the hospital as well because they\u0027ve saved my little girl\u0027s life.\u0027 Another woman whose child is being treated at the hospital after being in a car accident and whose son had a separate appointment at the hospital today said: \u0027We support Tom and Kate but we don\u0027t support them storming.\u0027We were walking out and I had my baby in a wheelchair. I was getting tossed and turned by coppers trying to get out and my baby was terrified,\u0027 she said. Some Twitter users compared the case negatively to the national euphoria following the birth of the royal baby on the same day. One said: \u0027A royal birth means nothing to me I\u0027d rather focus my attention to things closer to home and show my support for Alfie Evans. All the best little man.Another said: \u0027My thoughts are with Alfie Evans today, not the royal baby.\u0027      Alfie\u0027s father Tom said today he believes his son is going to die and threatened private prosecutions against medics from the hospital          A large crowd of around 200 demonstrators gathered outside the hospital today          Police guarded the hospital\u0027s entrance after a group of protesters surged towards the door          Merseyside Police said they recognised the \u0027sensitivities\u0027 involved in the case          A large crowd gathered outside the hospital after Mr Evans spoke of his fears his son would dieIt comes after a British judge said flying Alfie to a foreign hospital would be wrong and pointless, in a decision since backed by Britain\u0027s Appeal Court and the Supreme Court.An ECHR spokesman said today: \u0027The European Court of Human Rights has today rejected the application submitted by the family of Alfie Evans as inadmissible.\u0027The couple have argued that Alfie is being wrongly \u0027detained\u0027 at Alder Hey and have made a habeas corpus application.A writ of habeas corpus - Latin for \u0027you may have the body\u0027 - is a legal manoeuvre which requires a court to examine the legality of a detention.It is a piece of common law which probably dates back to Anglo-Saxon times.A spokesman for Alder Hey said: \u0027Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital remains open as usual for all visitors and appointments, however visitors may notice an increase in visible police presence in and around the hospital site - this is part of our ongoing security arrangements.\u0027 The case has echoes of that of Charlie Gard, who was born in August 2016 with a rare form of mitochondrial disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, including in his organs.The British boy died on July 29, one week short of his first birthday, after doctors withdrew life support treatment.Gard\u0027s parents fought a five-month legal battle for him to be taken to the United States for experimental treatment.They lost a series of appeals in British courts and the ECHR.      Around 200 people gathered outside the hospital after Mr Evans said his son would die today          Protestors want the hospital to keep Alfie alive and allow his parents to decide his care          Protesters who call themselves \u0027Alfie\u0027s Army\u0027 held placards outside the hospital today          A protester ties a balloon to a road sign on which demonstrators have tied messages          His parents Tom Evans and Kate James are fighting to have him moved to a hospital in Rome.

However, the book failed to perform well after many pointed out that the book contains very generic and obvious suggestions.Pippa has also written for publications such as The Spectator, The Sunday Telegraph and was named contributing editor of Vanity Fair in 2013.           Pippa  nearly stole the show during 2011\u0027s Royal Wedding of Kate Middleton and Prince WilliamIn April, just before Kate Middleton gave birth to a baby boy, it was reported that Pippa was pregnant and due to give birth in October 2018.What is Pippa Middleton’s net worth?Pippa Middleton’s net worth is estimated to be $1 million (£716,425), according to Celebrity Net Worth.The majority of that money derives from the £400,000 advance Pippa was paid for her 2012 book, \u0027Celebrate\u0027.In 2015, Pippa’s company PXM Enterprises, which manages her ‘publishing activities’, posted accounts revealing that Kate Middleton’s sister made over £200,000 between May 2013 and May 2014.

Around 4 p.m., after Madonna had given her small household staff the rest of the day off, he scaled the fence encircling the estate, broke into the house and confronted a terrified Madonna. \u0027After slapping her around, he bound and gagged her, then strapped her to a chair with twine.

Prince George talks to his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth ahead of the Christening of his sister Princess Charlotte  Prince Charles with Prince William and Harry pictured inside Kensington Palace (left) and the family with Princess Diana (right)‘He adores bath time with the children,’ says one of William’s circle.The new Prince will be introduced to a surprisingly ‘normal’ life in Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace. While there are domestic staff — with an intriguingly international flavour — they are nothing like the number employed by Charles and Diana when William was a child. They had a least a dozen full-time staff in London, including a dresser for the Princess, housekeeper, butler and a valet for the Prince.The key figure today is Maria Borrallo, 47, the stern-looking, but engagingly personable, nanny who has been with the couple since the arrival of George.          An official pictured released for Prince George\u0027s birthday Then there’s the housekeeper, Antonella Fresolone, who used to be one of the Queen’s senior housemaids, working at Buckingham Palace for 13 years. As well as overseeing the running and cleaning of Apartment 1A, she loves serving up steaming pasta dishes from her native Italy to the family.Fijian ex-paratrooper Tifare Alexander — known as ‘Tif’ — performs odd jobs and the occasional bit of chauffeuring.When Prince Philip retired from official duties last year, two of his staff who were on secondment from the Army — Corporal Stewart Harvey and Lance-Sergeant Stuart Hayes — moved across to join William and Kate’s team as orderlies and, when needed, to help Harry at nearby Nottingham Cottage, which he now shares with fiancée Meghan Markle.Their duties, apart from walking William and Kate’s pet cocker iel Lupo, have been to help as waiters at social functions and official dinners, as well as cleaning shoes and delivering hand-written notes, a royal custom.That\u0027s my boy!

George and Charlotte wait in the window of Kensington PalaceWilliam has succeeded in creating something of the warm family atmosphere he found with the Middletons when he first knew Kate. But, as working royals, he long ago accepted that his and Kate’s home could never be quite like theirs. He’s matched them in one area, however — like them, he now has three children.By last night everything had been made ready in the Peter Rabbit-themed nursery to welcome home George and Charlotte’s new baby brother. I gather there are some new additions to the nursery, but no fresh licks of paint.There are, however, lots of new soft toys already — some from George and Charlotte — and many baby presents have also been delivered to the Palace.Officially, the couple say they won’t be hiring a maternity nurse to help with the early days of the new arrival. Insiders say Kate plans to breastfeed her new baby, but no one would think less of her if she did decide to call in specialist help, particularly during the night (a maternity nurse will normally sleep with the newborn and take the baby to its mother to be fed).After the birth of Prince George in 2013, Kate was on her knees with exhaustion because he hardly slept, and wanted his mother’s constant attention.When George was born, William and Kate had the builders in at Kensington Palace and were still living in cosy two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage.They almost immediately headed off to the Berkshire home of the Duchess’s parents.          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for photographs in the garden of Kensington Palace with their son George and dogsBy the time Charlotte arrived two years later, the £4.5 million refurbishment of Apartment 1A had been completed. With five reception rooms, three master bedrooms with adjoining dressing rooms and bathrooms, there is certainly plenty of space.The imaginative transformation includes a night nursery where Charlotte and George sleep, and a day nursery for playtime.On the first floor are the master bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and his-and-hers dressing rooms.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where they live in Nottingham Cottage, after they announced their engagement.On the top floor, reached by a lift, are nine further bedrooms for staff, while a basement area where the photographer Earl of Snowdon once had his darkroom is now a well-appointed gym with laundry and luggage rooms nearby.The kitchen, on which the couple spent £170,000 of their own money, is the heart of this royal home, and where they like to entertain close friends and family.For more formal occasions guests, who arrive through a bright and airy entrance hall with intricate cornicing and black and white flagstones, are shown to one of the two drawing rooms — in one there is a grand piano and cream sofas with floral scatter cushions.Soon enough, the latest addition to the House of Windsor will no doubt be crawling all over them with mischief in mind."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/01/4B62894900000578-0-image-m-15_1524442617384.jpg","title":"QUENTIN LETTS sees humbling Home Secretary","story":"    Miss Rudd issued another apology for British bureaucracy\u0027s goofs in demanding paperwork from West Indian immigrants who have lived here for decadesFrom that far corner he just monitored a delicate matter.

While there are domestic staff — with an intriguingly international flavour — they are nothing like the number employed by Charles and Diana when William was a child. They had a least a dozen full-time staff in London, including a dresser for the Princess, housekeeper, butler and a valet for the Prince.The key figure today is Maria Borrallo, 47, the stern-looking, but engagingly personable, nanny who has been with the couple since the arrival of George.

Insiders say Kate plans to breastfeed her new baby, but no one would think less of her if she did decide to call in specialist help, particularly during the night (a maternity nurse will normally sleep with the newborn and take the baby to its mother to be fed).After the birth of Prince George in 2013, Kate was on her knees with exhaustion because he hardly slept, and wanted his mother’s constant attention.When George was born, William and Kate had the builders in at Kensington Palace and were still living in cosy two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage.They almost immediately headed off to the Berkshire home of the Duchess’s parents.

But his magnificent work is still no match for the Parthenon Marbles. My god, what art!The British Museum’s astonishing, ravishing, sublime new exhibition – I could add a lot more superlatives and still be understating it – brings you face to face with the most revolutionary sculptures ever created. It also has some fine works by Auguste Rodin.The wonder hits you as soon as you enter and find yourself confronted by Rodin’s The Kiss sharing a pedestal with two goddesses carved two and a half millennia ago. The Kiss is, well, it’s The Kiss – one of the most sensual and captivating masterpieces of modern times, a provocatively erotic blast of free love that shook Paris in 1882. It is one of the best-known, best-loved sculptures in the world. And those old Greek goddesses blow it away. Partly, it is a matter of sheer heft. The version of The Kiss exhibited here is a delicate white plastercast loaned, like most of the Rodins here, by the Musée Rodin in Paris. The goddesses were carved from a huge block of marble by the Greek artist Phidias and his team. They had the inspired idea of letting two figures flow into one, with the front goddess reclining against her companion’s lap as their bodies interfold under rivers of exquisitely carved drapery. If Rodin’s Kiss is sensual, so is this, but in a more mysterious way. These beings are superhuman yet human, ethereal and carnal, soft and strong. They make The Kiss appear slight and easy, like a piece of soft porn exhibited beside, well, beside the Parthenon marbles.For this pair of nameless and – due to a gunpowder explosion when Athens was under Turkish control – headless inities are part of the stupendous array of carvings Lord Elgin removed from the Parthenon at the start of the 19th century and shipped to London. The debate about the ethics of what Elgin did has been raging for more than 200 years and this exhibition won’t change that. Its title is perhaps an attempt to deflect the argument, though, for this show is not about Greek art in general but rather about Rodin’s obsession with the Parthenon marbles – and how modern, how alive, how strange and dreamlike they look when we see them through his eyes.There was a time not so long ago when the classics needed no defenders. Classical, from the Latin for “the highest class”, means best. In Athens in the 5th century BC, a style of art was invented – at once acutely real, viscerally carnal and otherworldly – that so impressed later generations, it became “the classical”, the best, the definition of great art.Today, we have an arsenal of words to dismiss it: formal, rigid, cold, deathly, even Eurocentric. That’s why a lot more people rage about ownership of the Parthenon marbles than actually take much time to look at them. Artistic taste in the 21st century is so far from revering the ancient that, to get some proper aesthetic attention for these supreme masterpieces, the British Museum has to bring in a famous modernist. If Rodin saw something in these old stones, maybe we can too – that seems to be the logic.And it works brilliantly, because Rodin really did love the Parthenon sculptures. From an 1896 bust of his friend Mariana Russell posing as Pallas (Athena) with the Parthenon sprouting from her head, to sketches of the Parthenon marbles he made while staying in a hotel across the road from the British Museum (to be near them), there’s abundant evidence of his passion.This flows through what amounts to a complete retrospective of his dizzying career. Two full-size versions of The Thinker, an array of swarming images in plaster, marble or bronze from his masterpiece The Gates of Hell, and even The Burghers of Calais, brought from its usual home by the Houses of Parliament, reveal the boundless imagination and boldness of Rodin.We find it hard to describe innovation except in terms of generational war: the new must crush the old. So it is all too tempting to think an artist like Rodin, who invented modern sculpture singlehandedly, must have despised the past. This exhibition provides ample evidence of how erroneous that is. It includes Rodin’s own collection of ancient Greek and Roman art. Some coins? A piece of amphora? No, he bought full-sized classical statues including a torso of Aphrodite and a youthful Hercules. He loved what time has done to them: their broken bodies inspired his own incomplete images of human forms tortured by pain and longing.Rodin understood that one of the most powerful ideas in ancient art is pathos. Greek art is addicted to the body but that doesn’t make it simply sexual. The body can express pain in tautened muscles, harrowed poses. That is why The Burghers of Calais, with its anguished figures expressing tragedy to their fingertips (literally – those twisted fingers say it all), is the most truly Greek of Rodin’s masterpieces even though it has a medieval theme.Interwoven with his works are some of the greatest sculptures from the Parthenon, brought across the museum from their usual home in the dreary, outdated Duveen Galleries and shown here much more intimately that ever before – low down, close up, with perfect lighting, and even delicately cleaned. My god, what art. A centaur is throttling a human of the Lapith tribe. Its thumb presses against the vulnerable neck with terrifying naturalism. What I’ve never noticed before is the totally convincing thumbnail that digs into the skin. All carved in marble.Cold? Rigid? Rodin didn’t think ancient Greek art was either of those things and nor will you after seeing the mad, marvellous exhibition that the British Museum’s sensitive Hellenophile curator Ian Jenkins has created with the Musée Rodin. Maybe what Rodin really has in common with the creators of the Parthenon is an insatiable appetite for life. Karl Marx called ancient Greece the happy childhood of humanity. That captures the joy and optimism we can still feel in the Greek vision. Of course, there is pain aplenty in the Parthenon sculptures. Yet it is part of an epic sense of the complex marvel of existence that bursts out of this exhibition like Athena from the head of Zeus. Rodin was right. The Parthenon marbles are the greatest works of art on earth, wherever they are housed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8952af7309acc6edfa0414f42ff4c44367c2c261/0_0_4256_2832/master/4256.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cfdd294c1d80c507d98cd710fbd1ce21 1400w","title":"london nights exploring capital after dark in pictures","story":"Fusing portraiture, documentary, conceptual photography and film, London Nights will reveal the capital after dark through photographs from the late-19th century to the present day.

It raises in a very sharp form the question of responsibility for what appears on a user’s screen: is the owner of the site responsible for the content that appears\u0026nbspthere, even though no human eye may ever have seen\u0026nbspit? Facebook and in fact all the ad-supported businesses on the internet maintain that they are platforms, not publishers. Their responsibility extends only to content they know about. Is this enough? Should they also be responsible for content they might reasonably anticipate?Facebook’s defence is that it has taken down inidual adverts as they are reported Lewis counter charges that they are soon, predictably, replaced with almost identical ones. It does appear odd that Facebook, which is extremely keen on facial recognition and can label the people in friends’ photograph feed with sometimes disconcerting accuracy, is apparently unable to recognise the face of a television personality made as recognisable as possible or to kill automatically any ad in which it appears. In a similar way, YouTube, owned by Google, is far more successful at keeping pornography off the site than it is at keeping off incitements to hatred or bullying. All that really frightens them is the thought of driving advertisers away.There is a technical defence in these cases: the advertising business on the web is almost entirely automated, and human judgment appears to play no\u0026nbsppart\u0026nbspat all. Every time you load a page on an ad-supported site an invisible auction is conducted between competing programs in microseconds to sell\u0026nbspthe advertising slots on it, based on everything that is known about you from all across the internet and indeed elsewhere.That is why the harvesting of enormous quantities of data is so important to all these companies: not just for the personal information that you know you are giving up, but for the further information that can be extracted by looking for patterns across tens of millions of other users. This means, in theory, that advertisers can search across the whole of the internet for the cheapest place to reach the audience they have in mind, while publishers can deliver the most exquisitely segmented audiences., too, is enmeshed in this system, just as every other newspaper is. Nonetheless, it’s clear that the complexity of the technologies involved can’t be used to remove all human or corporate responsibility. The participants in an ad-funded online world are to some extent publishers as well as platforms. The software they use did not write itself. Algorithms are not acts of God or nature. They are the product of human ingenuity and, as such, there have to be humans or corporations held responsible for their actions. This principle is obvious when it comes to the software that drives cars. Why should the software that drives advertising be any different?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ece9298269f905abdbd35c04782a6a61cf8163e/0_255_4229_2537/master/4229.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abdca29762038100706aa8424f89ce86","title":"the guardian view on macron in washington a need for results","story":"A young European leader flies to Washington on an official visit. He is a modernising charmer from the progressive wing of politics, articulate and comfortable with the media. He arrives to meet an American president whose politics are emphatically not his, and whose election has dismayed US liberals, disrupted the transatlantic alliance and alienated European opinion. The new US president is an American exceptionalist. He is no respecter of human rights and international institutions. But the European leader has decided to hug him close in the hope of influencing his decisions. Washington rolls out the red carpet. It is captivated by the visitor’s eloquence and charisma, such contrasts to their own leader’s bombast. Improbably, the two men find themselves starting to make big plans together.For anyone whose memory goes back to the run-up to the Iraq war, this is a sobering vision. When Tony Blair first visited George W Bush in 2001, he began a process that would end, among other things, in the wreck of his own reputation, the collapse of his party’s electoral ascendancy and the undermining of his country’s moral and international standing, all of which continue in some degree to this day. Whether Emmanuel Macron, who arrived in Washington on Monday for a two-day state visit to Donald Trump, will give way to a Blair-like hubris in his dealings with the White House is too early to say. There are sound, serious reasons for thinking history will not repeat itself. But the risk is undoubtedly there.French public opinion likes its leaders to play a global role. But it is as hostile to Mr Trump as any in Europe. Mr Macron needs something more than White House and Capitol Hill plaudits this week if his pragmatic approach is to convince at home. Thus far, his record is not impressive. Mr Macron has not hidden his disagreements with Mr Trump. He has pressed the US president to reverse his abandonment of the Paris climate accord, to keep the US engaged in Syria to constrain the Assad regime, to hold off on his wish to pull out of the Iran nuclear accord and to pull back from his planned tariffs on EU goods.None of these has succeeded. If he can shift Mr\u0026nbspTrump on any of them, Iran in particular, it would be a surprise and a coup. The epiphenomena of the visit – the handshakes, tweets, pouts, talk of bromance and the fact it will overshadow Angela Merkel’s visit at the end of the week – will inevitably dominate this week’s headlines. That also happened when Mr Blair went to Washington in 2001 for a meeting that seemed at the time to be merely about toothpaste and sweaters. But\u0026nbspbeyond the symbolism of Monday’s dinner at George Washington’s home, where the key to the Bastille, a gift to the first president from the Marquis de Lafayette, hangs in the entrance hall, the substance of the Macron visit needs to be real.

Two-thirds of the fish UK consumers eat are imported from overseas, and the costs of those would rise, due to the trade barriers resulting from a hard Brexit. Moreover, the fall in the price of UK fish would lead to a drop in earnings for UK fishermen. Overall, the analysis shows closing the UK’s sea borders would be a “lose-lose situation” for both UK and EU consumers and fishing industries.The issue of fishing has become one of the most highly charged Brexit issues. The current EU system is perceived as unfair, with vessels from other EU nations landing 10 times more fish from UK waters than vice versa. Ministers have said UK boats will catch hundreds of thousands of tonnes more fish after Brexit. But fishermen have repeatedly expressed fears that the ministers will not “take back control” of UK waters, but instead will trade away access to British waters in exchange for access to other markets. In March, the UK government angered the industry by conceding that EU fishing rules will remain in place until 2020.Furthermore, the UK imports almost twice as much fish as it exports, with the top five being cod, tuna, prawns, salmon and haddock. The impact of a hard Brexit on trade would make these more expensive, the researchers found. The impact would also hit UK fish farms, which export most of their products, and the fish processing industry, which relies on imports.She said the apparent opportunity for the UK to “cash in” by closing marine borders is scotched by the analysis. “Overall, the advantage of an increased fish access is completely outweighed by the costs of protectionism,” the report concluded.Prof Bryce Beukers-Stewart, a fisheries expert at the University of York, UK, said: “What is interesting is they have taken a very broad view, unlike a lot of the other analyses.” This includes assessing impacts on both the UK and other EU nations, examining how changes in wild fisheries impact on farmed fish sales and how prices change.”It shows a familiar story – that the implications of Brexit are so much more complicated than the simple campaign message of ‘taking back control’ led people to believe,” Beukers-Stewart said, adding that he thinks a total ban on foreign vessels is unlikely as things stand.The increased fish caught in UK waters by UK boats in the hard Brexit scenario would be species such as blue whiting, herring and sand eels, Beukers-Stewart said: “There is not a huge appetite for these in the UK, to put it mildly.”But fisherman Aaron Brown, founder of the Fishing for Leave group, disagrees that the UK would lose out from a hard Brexit: “We regain approximately 600,000 tonnes net from a clean Brexit. Prices may drop short term but eventually they will recover as the UK processing industry also rebuilds.”“If the UK regains what should be rightfully her resources, implements new UK policy to address both EU and domestic failings, then the future can be very bright for British fishing,” he said.Helen McLachlan, at WWF-UK, said the new analysis held no surprises: “We import most of what we eat and export most of what we catch.” She said a good Brexit transition could see new rules enabling both a healthy ocean and a thriving fishing industry.The WUR analysis employed a widely used economic model and also tested to see how much changing the necessary assumptions affected their conclusions. The overall “lose-lose” outcome of a hard Brexit in fisheries remained in all circumstances, with only the scale of losses being different. “We have good trust in our results,” said Bartelings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d76d89edc88d7c902e5961f751cc848478c067e/678_209_2318_1391/master/2318.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f6057a1a7f0a1aad5ede7a729ae8c9","title":"verne troyer life in pictures","story":"Verne Troyer, who at 2ft 8in was one of the world’s shortest men, racked up 30 film credits in a career ning 24 years"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0217eb62c6bb14f360a9833d09a17cdfe15c7a8a/0_300_4585_2751/master/4585.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e455cece7a7fa7bb28149e5e886b5b58","title":"andres iniesta begins barcelona goodbye as an era draws to a close","story":"Departing legend belongs to us all – tears, applause and another moment of quiet awe marked a fitting cup final farewellThere were two minutes to go in the final, his final, when Andrés Iniesta began the long walk goodbye.Slowly, swallowing hard, eyes red, he made his way across the pitch, team-mates coming to embrace him as he went, and all around the politano supporters got to their feet, applauding. They stood in the Barcelona end and they stood in the Sevilla end too. Iniesta’s name rolled around, accompanying him until he ducked out of sight, taking a seat on the bench. He sat there for a little while, tears forcing their way through, and then he got up again and went to collect the Copa del Rey, alone.It was the 34th title of his career and a 35th will follow, but it was this one that felt like it marked the end: the last waltz. As he climbed up to collect the trophy, down on the grass Barcelona’s players waited for him, much as they had waited for him when, 51 minutes into his 670th game for Barcelona, he scored the fourth goal, ensuring that this would always be his night: the Iniesta Final.Collecting Lionel Messi’s pass, with a gentle shift of the hips, just a hint of a pause, he stepped past David Soria and rolled the ball in. He jumped into the air and at some point in that leap, sadness crept into the celebration, nostalgia flooding the stadium. They knew what this meant.Any doubt disappeared when they saw the Barcelona’s players’ reaction, more eloquent than anything they could have said. “There were a lot of emotions in that goal,” Iniesta admitted afterwards. “Lots of emotions, lots of feelings, lots of years. I really wanted this final to go well and I’m happy.” The normal huddle broke up and then, almost one by one, they waited for Iniesta, a moment each. Eyes closed, Messi held him in an embrace that may become the image of the final, maybe even a generation he held on just that little bit longer, like he didn’t want to let go.There was something in that. In good times and bad Messi looks for Iniesta, and in bad times above all. It is in those moments when he seeks security, assurance, that he most wants the Spaniard at his side. “I know how difficult it is to do what he does,” Messi says in Iniesta’s book, The Artist.“On the pitch I like him to be near me, especially when the game takes a turn for the worse, when things are difficult. That’s when I say to him: ‘come closer’. He takes control and responsibility.”It is a simple solution, successful for well over a decade and expressed on Saturday night, like a portrait of their era, Barcelona producing a performance that may have been as good as any since Wembley 2011. And yet time waits for no man, not even the man who sometimes seemed able to control it. You can slow the clock, but not stop it and when Messi looks for Iniesta next season, he will no longer be there he’ll be 5,000 miles away. 22 years after arriving, 18 after meeting Messi, 16 since his debut, Iniesta is leaving Barcelona he’s leaving Spain too, for China. An announcement is expected this week.At 33, a starter in 24 of 33 league games and eight of 10 in the Champions League, on course to win a league and cup double, it may have come too soon. That, certainly, was the conclusion drawn after Saturday night. China looks incongruous. The headline on the front of AS on Sunday morning said it all: “Iniesta, don’t go!” But the appeals for him to stay, while they express that hope that he might yet change his mind, will also reinforce his belief that this is the right time to go. The right way, too: remember me like this.Although Iniesta wouldn’t say so, something broke last year, and while a momentary fix was found, a “lifetime” contract signed and his role renewed, he didn’t want to leave too late, a long goodbye from the bench. Nor did he ever want to face the club he joined aged 12.Iniesta described that day in September 1996 when he arrived at La Masia as the worst of his life. José Bermúdez, another resident, remembered him as “pale, tiny and sad, delicate and sensitive”. Iniesta couldn’t stop crying. A few hundred metres away in the Hotel Rallye, nor could his parents. His father, José Antonio, couldn’t sleep and the same went for Andrés’s grandfather. Together, they planned to go and get him, take him home. Mari, Iniesta’s mum, stopped them. “Let him try,” she insisted. So, they did.They took him to school the next morning and then headed home to La Mancha. Iniesta felt abandoned when they weren’t there to pick him up that afternoon. Victor Valdés was there at the start. “His success was forged through silent tears,” Valdés says. It is some success: 34 titles, soon to be 35, his departure accompanied by another double. There have been two trebles as well, and the World Cup and the European Championship, twice in a row. Which makes it sound almost as easy as his football makes it look, but it hasn’t been.Iniesta does not use the word depression but he has spoken eloquently about the “dark place” he was in after the 2010 World Cup, how he felt in “freefall”. He went into the 2009 Champions League final with a hole in his thigh, ordered not to shoot. He reached the World Cup struggling with injury, running around hotel corridors in the middle of the night, unseen by team-mates, trying to prove his fitness to himself. It says something that Vicente Del Bosque said he would wait for him, as long as it took it says something too that when he suffered an injury 17 days before the 2009 final, Pep Guardiola insisted: “He plays.”He played, the way only Iniesta could, the way that became symbolic of a generation: arguably the best that football in Spain, maybe anywhere, has seen. “An era departs with him,” said AS’s match report. “A style, too. A way of playing and a way of life.” After Rome, Alex Ferguson talked about how “he and Xavi get you on that carrousel” and he experienced that again at Wembley in 2011, an era-defining display revived on Saturday.In South Africa, he scored the winning goal, 116 minutes into the final, peeling off his shirt to reveal a vest underneath. “Dani Jarque, always with us,” it said, written by the physio Hugo before kick-off for Iniesta to wear in honour of the Eyol captain, his friend, who had passed away after a sudden unexpected heart attack. Jarque’s wife Jessica watched the match on TV, her first in a year since his death. “Seconds before the goal, I knew it was coming. I started to cry before you scored,” she told Iniesta. As the ball sat up, he said he heard “the silence”.And then he scored. The goal.“Iniesta is leaving us,” ran one headline last week the key word was “us”.Iniesta is applauded at every stadium in Spain, but it is not just because of that goal and it is not just Spain. It happened in Turin and Lisbon too, and at the Santiago Bernabéu. On Saturday, it happened again it was not the first time but it felt like the last, a touch of melancholy. It is not just him, it is what he represents. “The last emperor,” Marca called him. “How happy he made us. Something in your soul dies when a friend goes nothing will ever be the same,” one editorial read last week – and that too was in Madrid.Iniesta belongs to everybody, like some shared treasure, held close but enjoyed together. Luis Enrique called him “world heritage”. When the goal went in on Saturday, on Cadena Ser radio the commentator joined those chanting his name. “The scriptwriter has done it this final needed this moment,” Lluis Flaquer said. “Iniesta! Iniesta! Iniesta! We can’t leave here without joining in the chant, which is the chant of all football lovers, dedicated to a universal manchego.”It is the player and the person, the way he is, that helps explain that. He is every man’s in part because he is everyman: there’s a normality about him which is not entirely normal in football, and he is universally admired. “He’s an amazingly good person someone kicks him and he’s the one who says sorry,” Samuel Eto’o insists. Sergio Ramos disagrees: “You can’t kick him it’s Andrés,” he says.After Spain defeated Croatia at Euro 2012, Ivan Rakitic, still not the club-mate he would become said: “We can play against all of them, but against Iniesta it is different. He is another level again. He has everything: he’s so fast, he thinks so quickly, he’s in control.” That day, Fernando Torres noted: “When he has the ball, it’s like everything else stops, like the camera is going in slow motion. I’ve known him for 15 years and he’s never, ever had a bad game.” On Saturday, Vicenzo Montella described him as an “extra-terrestrial”.Sometimes, though, it’s more than words. Some years ago now, Iniesta was recording a video, explaining to the camera as he walked through the move where he shifts the ball from one foot to another and back again. He came to the defender, a fellow Barcelona player, and went past him. Swish, swish, and he was gone. He was “walking” everyone through it but it still happened so fast as to be almost imperceptible. There was something of that in Saturday’s goal the ball doesn’t even change direction much the defender does, as if Iniesta is controlling him too. That day, there were only five or six people there but there was an audible gasp – from professional players.“Bloody hell,” one spat out.There is work behind it but Iniesta believes it’s intuitive. “What I did at 12, I still do now,” he says. What he does delights it also creates a sense of quiet awe, even among those for whom football holds fewer secrets. Vicente Del Bosque says it is like he is watching the game from the stands while still on the pitch, a player of “uncommon intelligence and awareness”. Paco Seirulo, fitness coach at Barcelona, talked about his “mastery of the relationship between space and time.” When Louis Van Gaal gave him his debut, he said: “There’s the pitch. It’s yours. Play.” He played. And play is the word.The day that Iniesta was first invited to train, Luis Enrique was sent to pick him up at the gate because otherwise the security guard, Antonio, wouldn’t have let him past. Luis Enrique later called him “Harry Potter” but doesn’t recall it, despite Pep Guardiola urging team-mates: “Remember this day, the day you first played with Andrés.” Guardiola knew he’d been encouraged by his brother Pere to see Iniesta a few years before. As he left, he came across a friend. “I’ve just seen something incredible,” he said. That day, Guardiola also famously told Xavi: “You’re going to retire me. This lad is going to retire us all.” Now, after 670 games, Iniesta is going too. He goes like this, playing his way.“He’s a phenomenon, a force of nature: no one plays like him and no one can compare to him,” wrote Xavi, the man who was closer to him than any other, who with Iniesta defined a generation. “Sometimes I get the feeling that Andrés doesn’t realise how important he is: one day he’ll retire and we’ll see the magnitude of what he has done.” He surely knows now, as that day draws closer: he saw it on Saturday. “It’s emotional to see the affection and respect people have for me,” he said.There is not long left, they know. Soon, maybe too soon, Lionel Messi will look across and see an empty space. They all will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ae54046702ea6760dd4cacc275d68ac7478792d/0_31_1656_994/master/1656.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=465aa35b76947e58534a903bedf9b6dc","title":"everton newcastle united premier league match report","story":"One banner called for Sam Allardyce to go at Goodison Park but Theo Walcott’s sharp finish shielded the Everton manager from further hostility. Those wishing to register distrust in the former England manager’s style must make do with a club survey for now.Walcott’s third Everton goal since arriving from Arsenal in January lifted an otherwise grim affair and Everton to eighth in the Premier League as Newcastle’s winning streak came to a subdued end. Rafael Benítez and his players have defied expectations to haul themselves clear of relegation danger but a lack of quality in attack was glaring.Newcastle finished on top, preying on Everton’s anxieties, having a handball claim against Phil Jagielka dismissed and almost equalising in the final seconds only for Seamus Coleman to intercept Jacob Murphy’s cross towards Dwight Gayle with a superb header.Benítez claimed Bobby Madley was too lenient with Everton’s physical approach but accepted that, in Walcott and Wayne Rooney, lavish spending at Goodison has at least bought the experience to make a difference in matches as mundane as this. “It might have been different if we had done better with the final pass in the final third,” the Newcastle manager said. “In this kind of game when they are very physical and the referee allows them to do these things, and they are at home and have quality, that is an advantage.”Unsurprisingly, Allardyce took an opposing view, suggesting Everton had been “excellent” for 75 minutes and lost their way only when Morgan Schneiderlin departed injured. Schneiderlin did impress, earning a rousing ovation from fans who had booed him on to the pitch a few months ago, but there was nothing excellent about this display beyond Walcott’s winner.Allardyce had called for clarity over his long-term position before a game attended by Everton’s major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri. A glance to his left before the kick-off will have given the Everton manager a reminder of the clarification many supporters are hoping for. “Our survey says … Get out of our club” read a banner draped over the upper Gwladys Street stand. Anti-Allardyce sentiment had been reserved for Everton’s away matches, unsurprisingly given the contrast in results on the road and at Goodison, but the recent PR fiasco of asking fans to rate an unpopular manager on a scale of zero to 10 presented an opportunity that was not missed at home. A solid but unspectacular performance did little to appease the restless natives.“The controversy was caused by an error from one of our employees who recognises it wasn’t the right thing to do,” said Allardyce on what was a wide-ranging survey. “As a manager you have to deal with it and move on. The players did the talking tonight by winning and moving us up to eighth. Let’s hope we finish the season as strong as we can.”Newcastle arrived free of relegation concern after four successive wins and with Jonjo Shelvey seeking to press his claims for a World Cup call from the England manager Gareth Southgate. He was unable to do so as Schneiderlin and Idrissa Gueye controlled the midfield contest while a lack of composure with the final ball cost Newcastle several promising openings.The visitors should have punished a miscued clearance from Jordan Pickford that invited Ayoze Pérez the freedom to play the fit-again Islam Slimani through on goal. Pérez badly overhit his pass, however, and the Everton goalkeeper was spared. Pickford was jeered throughout by the Newcastle support who have not forgotten nor forgiven the former Sunderland keeper for tweeting “Get the rave on” when his rivals were relegated in 2016. He responded with a “shush” gesture in the final seconds.Walcott made an encouraging start to his Everton career but had gone nine games without a goal, and several anonymous performances, when he enlivened the match with a smartly taken breakthrough. Yannick Bolasie was the provider, driving down the right and using Coleman’s overlapping run to create space for a dangerous cross to the back post. The ball rebounded into Walcott’s path via the unwitting DeAndre Yedlin and the winger took an assured touch before driving high into Martin Dubravka’s goal.Benítez, in his 100th game in charge of Newcastle, reacted by replacing Slimani with Gayle and the substitute should have equalised with his first touch. Shelvey’s corner was flicked on by Jamaal Lascelles to the striker, who had space inside the six-yard area, but his first-time shot sailed over Pickford’s crossbar.Pérez and Matt Ritchie also had opportunities before the crucial ing header from Coleman in stoppage time, with Gayle poised to convert, secured an important win for Allardyce."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4924510338c7a9309733af42528994edfca6d66/0_121_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c57cfb7fec5f4b16c98e43f4e04c21b4","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool champions league roma mo salah brexit","story":"Exclusive: Liverpool’s manager discusses the Champions League semi-final against Roma, a three-hour chat with Mo Salah, his health scare ... and BrexitJürgen Klopp is calm and serene. His face lights up, of course, at the prospect of “the mighty battle” which awaits Liverpool on Tuesday when Roma arrive at Anfield for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final. He also leans forward animatedly when assessing the intriguing challenge the Italians will pose. Yet, beyond the cliche of Klopp as a madly gurning cheerleader on the touchline, the 50-year-old German proved, again, his tactical nous and inspirational management while guiding Liverpool to three victories this season over the feted Premier League champions Manchester City. The 5-1 aggregate defeat of City in the quarter-finals was exhilarating and resilient.It is striking how, at Liverpool’s training ground, Klopp is also stimulated when discussing real life and tangled politics, Brexit and Angela Merkel. There are moments in a free-wheeling conversation when the hilarity feels unstoppable as Klopp considers a claim that he would win an election to become German chancellor because of his attention to detail, communication skills and empathy. But there are many more thoughtful moments – particularly when Klopp addresses the vexed issue of Brexit and his belief that British people should have the chance to vote again on their future in or outside the EU.We start, however, with Klopp reminiscing about his youthful desire to become a doctor. That teenage ambition chimes with his persistent interest in helping people “get better every day” and his work with players, from Mo Salah to Dejan Lovren, who improve in contrasting ways. “I was young when I thought about becoming a doctor,” Klopp says with a smile as he remembers growing up in the Black Forest village of Glatten. “I had the idea three years before my A-level. But to study medicine your A-level results had to be fantastic. So it was good for all the people who would have been under my knife that I didn’t make it. But it was close to be honest.”That wistful sentence is swamped by his laughter. But the idea of Dr Klopp is not outlandish. He exudes a warmth and intelligence we would all want to see in a doctor. “I have this helping syndrome,” Klopp says. “I really care about people and I feel responsible for pretty much everything.”Klopp’s inclusive leadership, ensuring everyone feels nurtured and needed, is at the root of his success. Is he also becoming a scouser as his immersion in Liverpool runs so deep? Klopp grins, brandishing his cup: “There’s this tea, for example. When we come somewhere new my family like to adapt. We want to live like people here. I’m not a guy who says: ‘By the way, I want to tell you in Germany we do it like this or that.’ We look so similar but we are very different too. It’s really interesting. My boys both work in Germany but they are football maniacs so they’re very often here. They tell me about the nightlife and I experience the country in the daytime.”Does life on this small island seem insular, particularly when the political landscape has shifted dramatically since he arrived? “I’ve heard it said that English people are not looking outwards but I don’t see it. I live in Formby and work in Liverpool. I drive from here to there and sometimes I’m in different cities for games. So I don’t know enough about the country but many people come to Britain because English is the language the world speaks.“The two leaders of the Leave campaign then stepped aside. It was a pure sign they were surprised themselves by the vote. OK, that can happen. But then, come on, let’s sit together again. Let’s think about it again and let’s vote again with the right information – not with the information you’ve got around the Brexit campaign. They were obviously not right, not all of them. It makes no sense at all.This embrace of Europe does not mean Klopp is disparaging towards British footballers. More than most Premier League clubs he has an English core to his squad. Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Adam Lallana, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez, Nathaniel Clyne, Dominic Solanke and Danny Ings are joined by other bright young talents such as Scotland’s Andrew Robertson and Wales’ Ben Woodburn.“They are here because they’re really good – not because they’re English or British. But if you have two players at the same level and one is English and the other is from somewhere else I always go for the English guy. They keep the mood good and for them it’s easy to feel the club’s history. But we have fantastic boys from all over the world and they love the club. Roberto Firmino has such a Liverpool heart. But the English guys lead the group. Tottenham and us we are pretty much the English national team and I like that.”Did he spend much time assessing Salah’s character before signing him? “I always meet the player before we sign. That’s when I decide because I have a good feeling for people. It was a fantastic talk. He’s open, smiling all the time. He has crazy curls but he’s a really nice boy. He also looked much more mature than it says on his passport. Twenty-four? I was: ‘Wow, really?’ We talked for three hours about everything from his family to my family and at the end we had a deal to work together. I like to remind players from time to time of that agreement. It’s working really well with Mo.”Lovren has had a more testing season and mistakes against Spurs and Manchester United meant that many Liverpool fans denounced him. But his resurgence has been marked and, against City, he was a clear leader. “There are some really difficult things in Liverpool,” Klopp says. “The whole Liverpool family is not happy with not winning big trophies since whenever – so you always find a reason. ‘The problem is we don’t spend enough.’ Or, ‘The players make mistakes’. So, really, it’s a difficult job to be Liverpool’s goalkeeper. I’m not sure who was the last goalkeeper everybody was happy with here. It would be a while ago. And if you are not Sami Hyypia then your life as a defender is also difficult.“I don’t exactly know about Dejan’s start at Liverpool but he made a few mistakes. People always have that in mind: ‘Oh, Lovren again!’ But I’m long in the business. I said to Dejan: ‘If somebody told me, come on, you have the chance, create a centre-half. We found a way to do it, genetically, bam, bam, bam.’ That’s him, strong, quick, both feet, can head like crazy, jumps through the roof. He’s all you need. Yes, a few things you can improve – his concentration. But these are human beings.“Other centre-halves make mistakes. Against City, Virgil van Dijk, an outstanding person and fantastic player, should have cleared the ball before they scored. Virgil knows that. But nobody spoke about it because we won. It doesn’t look like it but I’m really relaxed in judging these things. When I see talent, and I’m convinced, I am calm.”It helps that Klopp has been here before although, when we remember our previous interview, before Dortmund lost to Bayern Munich in the 2013 Champions League final, he grimaces. “I’ve never watched it back. It’s too painful.”Manchester City felt Champions League pain against Liverpool – but soothed themselves by winning the league with five games to spare. How close are Liverpool to a concerted tilt at City’s title next season? “It’s an interesting question because while we improved a lot they do the same. You can’t imagine that City, after a brilliant season, will say: ‘Oh, that’s so good we’ll keep the same squad.’ They will find new players. I also noticed an interesting thing. Their club has more money than every club in the world but I saw the City boys celebrating in a really nice way in the pub. It showed a real team.”It has been another draining season but Klopp looks fit and well. He was said to have suffered a minor health scare in November when he went to hospital. “We all go for a check now and then but nobody knows. It was actually a funny situation. They tried to bring me in through the back door but the security guy has a walkie-talkie and he says: ‘Klopp is in the house!’ But, really, I’m fine. I love the job but if somebody told me: ‘If you carry on you will die much earlier’ then I’d say immediately: ‘Thank you. I’m on the road home.’”He looks intrigued when I point out that, after spending seven years each at Mainz and Dortmund as manager, his Liverpool contract runs until 2022. He will then have completed a third seven-year stint at a club with whom he has fallen in love. “The seven years is a coincidence. When you have a marriage and if you’re past your seventh year then you’re OK. But, actually, I don’t need this kind of settling. It’s not in my nature. But when I am in a club I am in it totally.”Liverpool are lucky to have him but, thinking of that seven-year cycle, I joke with Klopp that some people have another job in mind for him. Martin Quast, a German sportswriter, said: “If Klopp wanted to run for German president, he would get elected. He would bring people together, lead the way, make people happy.”After Klopp has stopped laughing he explains that Quast is from Mainz. “Maybe in 2004 I could have been chancellor of Mainz. But I have absolutely no skills apart from being interested in politics. I would enjoy it if a politician spoke like a normal person but the job is complex. So we should care about our good people in politics because there’re not many of them. It’s like being a football manager. Many people are interested in football but only a few combine all the skills. Politics is even more difficult. I could never do it – or want to do it.”Klopp as German chancellor would still be fun and maybe he could find a way to help Brexit Britain. “Hmmm,” Klopp says with mock seriousness. “Angela Merkel has two weeks off a year.

Not since Maradona wore the shirt have Napoli known times like theseTell a story in two words. Diego Maradona did his best in the moments that followed Napoli’s stunning 1-0 victory over Juventus in Turin on Sunday night, logging in to Facebook and hammering in a phrase screamed everywhere from a Mediaset Premium commentary box to the bars and piazze of Naples (in the latter case: with a few extra expletives laced in). “Mamma miaaaa!!!”Not since Maradona himself wore the shirt have Napoli known times like these. By the time the Partenopei touched down back at Capodichino airport, the crowd awaiting them was reported to have swelled to as many as 10,000 people.Their flight had been delayed by 90 minutes to allow local authorities to get a grip on the situation from a security standpoint. Napoli landed at 1.30am, but it was past 4am before their team bus started to pull clear of the throng. Even then, an informal convoy of mopeds and cars trailing scarves and flags accompanied them on the drive back toward their Castel Volturno training ground. Similar scenes had played out in reverse a day earlier, thousands gathering outside Napoli’s Stadio San Paolo to lend the team a proper send-off before it travelled north. All this for a game that could not change their position in the league standings. Win or lose, Napoli would end the day in second place.And yet, when Kalidou Koulibaly rose to break the deadlock with a 90-minute header, everything really did seem to change. Four days earlier, Napoli had been losing at home to Udinese while Juventus led away at Crotone. If those results had held, the gap at the top would have widened to nine points. Instead, by the end of Sunday, it was down to just one.Juventus still lead the way, still have control of their own destiny. But their remaining four games include away trips to face Inter and Roma: both fighting tooth and nail for a Champions League berth. Napoli’s schedule is not exactly soft, with visits to Fiorentina and Sampdoria still to come, as well as home fixtures against Torino and Crotone. If offered the chance, though, would they really trade places?It is not simply a question of the fixture list, either. The impact of this win went beyond what you could read in the standings. A month earlier, following a win over Genoa, manager Maurizio Sarri responded to a question about whether his team could win the title by saying that “if it was up to me we would go to the palace and seize power.”The Allianz Stadium has not so much been a palace as a fortress for Juventus, a place where they previously lost just seven games in as many years. The Bianconeri had faced Napoli six times here in the league, winning on every occasion. To break such a run could hardly fail to leave a psychological impact.Reminded of his words on Sunday, Sarri initially tried to turn them back on journalists, saying “that supposes Juventus are the power. That’s you saying that.” But he extended the thought by agreeing. “They are a team who have won the Scudetto for six years in a row, they represent the technical power, and in my opinion some other power too, so they are the team everybody wants to beat.” Napoli never gave Juventus a moment to settle. Lorenzo Insigne could have put them in front in the very first minute, darting between two defenders to reach a deflected cross but getting his shot all wrong under pressure for Giorgio Chiellini. The defender hyper-extended his knee in the challenge and limped out of the game 10 minutes later. His departure was a blow for the hosts, but it can hardly explain their failure to register a shot on target for the first time ever in this venue.Napoli were imperfect, even ragged at times, yet they fought to sustain an active high press, routinely sending as many as three players to smother the opponent in possession. You got the impression that they were enjoying their status as underdogs, after appearing in some recent games to be weighed down by the expectation that they must always win against lesser opponents.The goal hardly felt inevitable – if anything, we are more accustomed to seeing Juventus find a way to steal a decisive moment in games such as this – yet it was a just reward for the only team that truly tried to win. There was something poetic about the fact that it should be scored by Koulibaly, a towering giant in a team most famous for its trio of “marvellous smurfs” up front.“Juventus are still in front and so almost nothing changes,” insisted Sarri afterwards. “We just need to think about the match in Florence, Juventus are in front and our chances are very slim.”He was not fooling anyone. The fireworks continued long into the night in Naples, fans flooding the streets and squares far away from the airport, too, while delirious pizzaioli served up free dinners.The night had started on a rather less edifying note, Sarri caught showing a middle finger to Juventus fans as Napoli’s team bus arrived at the stadium. Rather than apologise afterwards, he clarified that his gesture was not aimed at the club’s fans in general, but merely those who “were spitting at us and insulting us because we are Neapolitan”.His unrefined manner is not always appreciated outside of Naples but then, wasn’t the same true of Maradona? If he and his players can see this dream through to its conclusion, they will earn a place every bit as indelible in club lore.• A quietly very impressive win for Roma, as they geared up for their Champions League semi-final against Liverpool. Spal were unbeaten in eight, yet Eusebio Di Francesco still dared to rest a number of starters. Roma even got a goal from Patrik Schick, the striker finally breaking his duck.• And in case you hadn’t spotted it, I had the chance to sit down with Di Francesco over the weekend for a one-on-one – talking about that semi-final, but also the importance of having fun in football, the psychological impact of a three-man defence and the differences between this Roma team and the one that lifted the Scudetto in 2001. • The race for those last two Champions League places, though, remains as tight as ever. Lazio thrashed Sampdoria, with Ciro Immobile becoming the first Italian since Antonio Di Natale to score 29 goals in a Serie A season. Inter were less impressive but they stepped up a gear in the second half and remain one point behind the two Rome clubs.• What a mess at Udinese, who were pushing for Europe in February but find themselves at risk of relegation now after an 11th consecutive defeat – this one at home to Crotone. Gino Pozzo, who in recent times has devoted more of his time and energy to Watford, flew back to Italy last week to attempt to get a handle on the situation, and now faces a delicate decision over whether to stick by manager Massimo Oddo with only four games left.• Crotone’s win spelled the end for Benevento, mathematically relegated just a day after they had beaten Milan at San Siro. It will go down as one of calcio’s more peculiar footnotes that the Witches were unbeaten in two games against the Rossoneri in this, their first-ever top-flight season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3f3ddc8388fe68cda29eddc2c867752c3afef19/0_991_4110_2466/master/4110.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=872f87cd45ee7e1575b55c735414ce35","title":"how to redesign the vaginal speculum","story":"The number of women going for cervical tests is at its lowest in 19 years. An all-women team at the US design firm behind early Apple computers hopes that replacing the 19th-century metal tool with their silicone model will help change thatYou lie back, legs wide. You relax as much as you can. Anxiety makes you clench, because someone you probably don’t know is about to insert an implement into your vagina. This procedure is what most of us call a smear test (its official name is “cervical screening”) and it is the best prevention we have against cervical cancer, which kills an average of two women a day in the UK. “It’s generally never a pleasant experience,” says Andy Nordin, president of the British Gynaecological Cancer Society. “But it doesn’t have to be an ordeal.”What is keeping women away? All sorts: fear of pain embarrassment the fact that no woman likes lying supine while being probed with an instrument by a stranger. Perhaps the vaginal speculum has something to answer for. It looks like an alarming tool its two arms forming the shape of a duck’s bill. There is a screw on the outside that can pinch the labia as it is inserted (although most providers cover it). It can make\u0026nbspunsettling noises. In short, it looks like what it is: something devised by male gynaecologists in the 19th century. Nowadays, disposable plastic ones are commonly used. They’re not as cold: speculums being warmed on radiators used to be a common sight. But plastic ones have their flaws, too, and not just the fact that they are disposable and used in their hundreds of thousands. “The plastic speculum can be more difficult to remove,” says Dr Virginia Beckett, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. “Plastic doesn’t ‘run’ as well as metal so it can get caught.”A team at Frog, a San Francisco company that designed early Apple computers, thinks a different design may make the dreaded smear test less dreaded. The idea came when designers Hailey Stewart and Sahana Kumar both had pelvic exams in the same week. “We’re designers,” says Fran Wang, a mechanical engineer who is also on the design team, “and we talk about things that bother us.” Once they got talking, a lot of things bothered them: the lack of information, the cold instrument, the fact that no one ever talked about this stuff. They joined forces with a fourth female colleague and coined a name, Yona, from the Sanskrit word “yoni” for the female life form. They addressed the material. Which industry, they asked themselves, knew about making objects that you insert into your body? They looked at sex toys and chose silicone. Next: the shape. Three arms would be better than two, they decided. They worked on the angles. A speculum’s handle is at 90 degrees, which requires the operator to ask the patient to do what the Yona team call “the last scooch”, an embarrassing shuffle along the table. They changed the angle to 105 degrees to prevent that.Yona looks less alarming than the metal speculum. But it hasn’t been tested on people with vaginas yet: there is still investment to find, and rigorous clinical trials before that can happen. Still, the Yona team thinks it has done something positive, and not just materially. “We have had so many emails from people,” says Rachel, “telling us the most intimate stuff. We have sparked a conversation.”Beckett who likes the idea of silicone, though metal has advantages. “Metal conducts heat,” she says, “so it quickly takes on the temperature of the vagina.” Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, however, say the current design is adequate. There are all sorts of sizes, for a start, to fit different women. The trust would like to see self-testing, particularly for women who are postmenopausal, with dryer vaginas that make insertion painful, or anyone who has experienced sexual trauma.Next year, England and Wales will also switch to a different sort of primary screening. Instead of testing first for cells, women will be tested for human papilloma virus (HPV), which causes most cervical cancer. “There is some evidence,” says Nordin, “that to test for HPV you don’t have to get cells from the cervix. That’s where self-testing may come in, if you popped a swab into the lower vagina and tested for the RNA and DNA of the virus. It wouldn’t test for cells, but if you found smear tests painful, it would be better than nothing.”The smear test isn’t going away, so it has to get better. For Beckett, it’s all about the approach. “If they are given a careful explanation,” she says, “most women tolerate screening very well.” Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust has tips to deal with anxiety: use a meditation app, wear a skirt or take someone with you. Providers should make sure women know what is happening and that a smear test will probably be uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. If it is, a woman should feel able to say “stop”.Indeed, it seems that the key to getting more women to screening and making the screening better isn’t hardware but software. When I had a vaginal examination recently, I was anxious. The nurse was a man (with a chaperone). The gel was cold. I was lying on my back in a vulnerable position. But it was the smoothest procedure I have had for years. Why? Because the nurse did a great Joyce Grenfell impression. Material\u0026nbspscience is great, but good people-science is better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b11c4b8acb08b1bb99996e19fa0ec6680f9f5c91/839_216_4649_2789/master/4649.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d49ab541276b31e0939a65b9f0ca430","title":"instant custard creme brulee birds recipe ruby tandoh","story":"This storecupboard essential forms the base for a no-fuss – and nearly instant – version of this classic puddingIt’s not uncommon for me to step out into the world dressed up like a tin of Bird’s custard powder, decked out in primary red, yellow and blue.

But the political focus can easily obscure rather than illuminate more fundamental issues at stake.This is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over Europe. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.What does it matter?Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations, security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays which will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as carmaking could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised. Could the UK stay in a customs union?Britain will necessarily leave the existing EU customs union as a direct legal consequence of Brexit, but it could strike a new customs union deal that would replicate many of the advantages. Much like the deal Turkey has negotiated, this would, however, limit the freedom Britain would have to negotiate other trade deals independently of the EU. A future UK government could, in theory, erge from the common external tariff, but foreign importers would know that they could always fall back on EU ports of entry to access our market. At best, therefore, it would require close collaboration between the EU and UK when negotiating third-party trade deals. At worst, Britain would lose any new negotiating clout.What does the government propose instead?Whitehall civil servants have outlined two alternatives to preserve the freedom of life outside a customs union while limiting the disruption from leaving. The first, called “a highly streamlined customs arrangement”, relies on technology and goodwill to limit the impact of new checks. A “trusted trader” scheme and exemptions for small firms in Northern Ireland are intended to put the onus on European business to police itself but would do little to help with other international trade. The second proposal, a “new customs partnership with the EU”, is more ambitious and would see the UK continue to act as if it were in a customs union when dealing with imports from elsewhere. If they are bound for EU markets, the appropriate tariffs would be collected and passed on.What’s the problem?The snag with both of Theresa May’s plans is that no one else believes they are workable. The Irish government and UK business leaders fear that the “customs arrangement” could never be streamlined enough to make a difference. A full-blown “customs partnership” is viewed with even more scepticism in Brussels, where EU officials and MEPs are united in describing it as “magical thinking”. Now even some Brexit-supporting Tories have turned on the plan, fearing it is a “con trick” that could still end up shackling the UK to European rules.Is there a plan B?Without a convincing proposal for avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, the UK risks seeing wider Brexit talks grind to a halt and giving business even more to fret about. Instead, the only other option would be to accept proposals by the Labour party and the CBI for the UK to enter into a limited customs union deal like Turkey. This would infuriate Brexiters like the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, who might resign in protest. For now, Downing Street has been forced to quash rumours it is willing to take this risk and is ploughing ahead with plan A.When does it all come to a head?Since a vote in the House of Lords supporting a customs union option last week, opposition has been growing in Westminster. MPs are scheduled to debate the issue again on Thursday, and will probably have a chance to vote on their own amendment after local government elections in May. A key cabinet subcommittee is to discuss how to handle the potential rebellion on Wednesday amid rumours it could become an issue of confidence in the whole government. Either way, with the EU demanding answers to the Irish question by the time of its next summit in June and preparatory legislation backing up in Westminster, the time for kicking the can down the road is fast running out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a63e298378c39cd4a568f8ab2af229d9b814a8c1/99_0_5563_3338/master/5563.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb98e2dc58253babc184ddf144aeb957","title":"scientists plan huge european ai hub to compete with us","story":"Exclusive: In an open letter, the scientists say the proposed Ellis institute is essential to avoid brain drain to big tech firmsLeading scientists have drawn up plans for a vast multinational European institute devoted to world-class artificial intelligence (AI) research in a desperate bid to nurture and retain top talent in Europe.The new institute would be set up for similar reasons as Cern, the particle physics lab near Geneva, which was created after the second world war to rebuild European physics and reverse the brain drain of the brightest and best scientists to the US.Named the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems, or Ellis, the proposed AI institute would have major centres in a handful of countries, the UK included, with each employing hundreds of computer engineers, mathematicians and other scientists with the express aim of keeping Europe at the forefront of AI research.In an open letter that urges governments to act, the scientists describe how Europe has not kept up with the US and China, where the vast majority of leading AI firms and universities are based. The letter adds that while a few “research hotspots” still exist in Europe, “virtually all of the top people in those places are continuously being pursued for recruitment by US companies.”The extent of the hiring frenzy and the damaging impact it is having on British universities was revealed in a  investigation last year. It found that PhD students had left their studies for six-figure salaries at US tech firms. Meanwhile, some universities had been hit so hard that they had lost an entire generation of talented young researchers.The letter, signed by scientists in the UK, France, Germany, Switzerland, Israel and the Netherlands, calls for work on the new institute to start this year. Under the proposal, participating countries would fund the institute as an intergovernmental organisation. The same approach is used to fund the European Molecular Biology Lab, which has a major centre in Cambridge.Artificial Intelligence has various definitions, but in general it means a program that uses data to build a model of some aspect of the world. This model is then used to make informed decisions and predictions about future events. The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites. In the future, it could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids. AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law. “Something needs to be done and it needs to be done now,” said Zoubin Ghahramani, professor of information engineering at Cambridge University and chief scientist at Uber. “It would provide Europe with centres of mass where we would have not 10 researchers but hundreds with expertise from different countries.”Ghahramani, one of the most influential AI researchers in Britain, joined Uber after the San Francisco-based firm bought Geometric Intelligence, an AI startup he co-founded with a New York University psychologist some years ago. Despite the move, which exemplifies the problems Europe now faces, he has driven the UK’s involvement in the proposal for the new lab.“This is of such importance to Europe it would be a terrible mistake not to do something major,” he said. “If we don’t act in this area, both European universities and European industry will start to drift downwards.”The institute’s stated mission is to ensure that the best AI research is performed in Europe, a goal that would drive jobs and economies and also give the region’s scientists a voice in shaping how AI changes the world, the scientists believe. Those who work at the institute would have the freedom to work with industry and launch startup companies based on the breakthroughs they make. Private and public investment in AI have soared on the back of breakthroughs in the field over the past few decades, but the US and China have firmly taken the lead. The technology has such potential that its impact on society is widely expected to be as profound as the industrial revolution. The first steps in building the institute are expected to begin with a collaboration between France and Germany with other nations joining later. Ultimately, each local lab would become a $100m facility with an annual budget of $30m. The potential for AI to have a dramatic impact on lives, by taking decisions in areas from healthcare and policing to defence and transport, has led to serious questions over who writes the rules on how AI is used. If Europe steps back and watches AI research from the sidelines, it will have little say in shaping its future, Ghahramani said. “The regulatory environment for technology is often led by the people who control the technology,” he said.Another major supporter of the institute, Bernard Schölkopf, director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany, said: “Europe has a unique academic research tradition, so we have managed to keep up for a number of years. But the US and China have recognised the strategic importance of this field and no single European country is a match for this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79f315f1b427a44369339e876644a922eae92b80/0_204_4548_2729/master/4548.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41af04a162589d4387c58110f5a7daef","title":"why hunts screen time limits for kids are scientific nonsense","story":"Shouldn’t policy be based on evidence – not the other way around?The future seems rosy for Jeremy Hunt. In his newest letter to social media firms, he envisions a future where every child gets a state-imposed and universal social media limit, similar to the alcohol units recommended by government. After a child surpasses a set cutoff point, their social media access is stopped for the day. Hunt makes it seem easy, practical, and better for children and parents alike.There is just one glaring problem. This drastic policy still needs the scientific evidence to back it up. Hunt announced yesterday that his chief medical officer will be taking charge of this. Well, as a scientist working in this area, I can tell Dame Sally Davies now: the evidence this policy needs doesn’t exist. If she is not willing to ignore large parts of the scientific literature or exaggerate a minority of low-quality studies, her job to find the amount of “science” to back up such significant state intervention will be impossible. And, to insert an important side-question, shouldn’t policy be based on evidence – not the other way around?Scientists examining child development and technology use have for years been trying to raise awareness of the misguided debate around children and screen time a debate often devoid of significant scientific evidence. The common comparison between screen time and drugs like alcohol indicates a misconception many politicians and journalists share. Screen time isn’t a chemical that, when ingested, causes concrete physiological changes that can harm the body and cause long-term dependency. It is a erse and ever-changing part of daily life.Notwithstanding this, the debate is oversimplifying the sheer ersity of technology and social media use. No inidual’s social media use is the same, with the content and context changing daily. It is therefore impossible to conclude what the universal effects of “social media use” are. Want to know the true effect of X minutes of social media use on a child? The answer will almost always be “it depends”: it depends on the kind of social media use, the usage patterns, the child’s motivations and the context. Until we accept this inherent complexity in scientific research, policymaking and media coverage, our efforts to help children and teenagers and tackle societal changes will be misplaced and inefficient.So, if the Department of Health wants to roll out large-scale policy changes, go ahead, but please do not try to make it sound like “science” backs it up.

With many young people eschewing alcohol, the beginning of the end of booze Britain is in sightA cool glass of sauvignon canalside in the summer. A soothing beer by a pub fire as the leaves turn red. Mulled wine with a Christmas mince pie. Alcohol is shot through British life like, well, shots on a night out. But recent trends suggest that might be changing. Could the British love of booze be drying up as surely as our passion for\u0026nbspcigarettes?The result was immediate: fag breaks at work were suddenly more frowned upon the huddle of people outside the pub failing to light a cigarette in the driving rain came to seem pitiful. All the incremental changes – the health warnings, legislation, the images of diseased lungs on fag packets, the association with impotence – led to a genuine cultural shift. If you wanted to keep smoking, you had to be really committed (addicted, maybe?). Social and fairweather smokers dropped away.Could the same trend be under way with our attitude to alcohol? Some experts believe so. It will be a huge shift, because drinking in the UK has a spirited history, stretching back thousands of years – jugs for fermenting alcohol go back to the stone age, past Hogarth’s Beer Street and Gin Lane in the 1700s through to the peak modern drinking period of the 90s and early 00s. This was the Britpop era: a wasted Jarvis Cocker mooning at Michael Jackson at the Brit awards in 1996 and the hideous proliferation of garish alcopops with brand names with no vowels. That period also saw\u0026nbspa breakdown in the social taboos around women’s drinking that led to\u0026nbspan explosion of alcohol being marketed to them. Witness the birth\u0026nbspof the ladette and girlfriends drinking boyfriends under the table. Witness a massive overall rise in consumption.As a society, we have always thought of drinking as a bit naughty. The language we use is telling. A “cheeky pint” after work a “swift half” “OK, but just one glass of merlot”. Everyone has feigned resistance at one time or another – but we don’t try very hard. And in recent decades, anyone who didn’t want to drink was considered an anomaly. You driving? You sick? You on antibiotics? You pregnant? You, you know … (whisper it) in recovery? An answer of none of the above would elicit raised eyebrows, a puzzled expression or, more likely, mirth. Possibly even anger or dislike. In years past, people who have chosen sobriety, or rarely had a drink, have been subject to intense peer pressure. Nondrinkers became isolated – not out of preference, but because British social life has been entirely organised around alcohol. Booze sat at the head of the table at dinner parties, dominated the dancefloor and landed deals at lunch meetings.But over the past decade, that culture has shifted. It has certainly been difficult to avoid the news that alcohol isn’t good for you. The most recent reminder came last week, care of a Lancet paper, reporting that every glass of wine or pint of beer over the daily recommended limit will cut half an hour from the expected life of a 40-year-old. And that recommended upper safe limit is lower than you might expect. The paper suggested five 175ml glasses of\u0026nbspwine or five pints a week – about 12.5 units in total. Overdo it, and you\u0026nbspare at greater risk of stroke, fatal\u0026nbspaneurysm, heart failure and early death.Then there’s the cancer risk. There was consternation in 2016 when Prof Dame Sally Davies, the government’s chief medical officer, told MPs just one glass of wine could increase the risk of breast cancer. This came just a few weeks after the recommended upper safe limit for men was revised down from 21 to 14 units a week, the same as for women.The quality newspapers interview health experts and sociologists about the problems with alcohol the popular press shames indulgent punters (usually northern, often women) on dark high streets, hitting the chip shops at 3am. That picture of the woman lying on her back on a bench, sozzled, gets wheeled out. And there have been all sorts of schemes and campaigns designed to curb our enthusiasm for drinking. There’s the Department of Transport’s road-safety Think! campaign, for instance, much of which has focused on drink driving. In 2012, Andrew Lansley and the Department for Health rolled out the Change4Life campaign, while Challenge 25, introduced in 2005 by the British Beer and Pub Association, encourages people who may look under 25 to carry ID when attempting to purchase alcohol, and encourages retailers to ask for it. This has made it harder for groups of teenagers to bulk buy supermarket-own tinnies. (Attempting to enter licensed premises to buy alcohol using a fake ID is a criminal offence, carrying a maximum £5,000 fine and up to 10 years imprisonment.)All of this legislation, campaigning and awareness raising has had an impact, just as they did on tobacco consumption. In particular, millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) and the later Generation Z (those born after 1996), are surprisingly sober.“Alcohol is a strange concept,” says Ben Gartside, 19, a politics student at Hull University who is originally from Manchester. “Here’s a liquid you can drink and it can lead to you not remembering the night before and making bad decisions.” Ben is typical of many young people I speak to, in that he prefers to spend his money on food and travel rather than pub sessions.Another young person I speak to says his family are heavy drinkers and he wanted to avoid falling into that pattern. In a broader sense, says Dr James Nicholls, director of research and policy development at Alcohol Research UK, this is quite common among young people they are rebelling against older generations’ chosen methods of rebellion. According to a 2017 ONS study, more than a quarter of 16- to 24-year-olds are teetotal, a four-fold increase on the rest of the population, with just one in 10 seeing drinking as “cool”. Nicholls says that drinking among young people has been declining for a decade.The millennials and Gen Zers I spoke to cited various reasons for their sobriety one of the most recurrent was that between university tuition fees, the axing of maintenance grants and the sixth form EMA grant, and the perilously high cost of housing, they are pretty much broke. But they also have concerns for their mental and physical health. Lauren Clapp, 23, says booze made her chronic fatigue syndrome worse. There is also a case to be made that young people, who suffer disproportionately with mental health issues (a third of 16- to 24-year-olds have experienced a mental health issue in the past 12 months, according to one survey), are more open to talk and seek support, relying less on substances as an emotional crutch.But not everyone is laying off, even with the growing awareness of alcohol’s negative side effects. There are plenty of people who hold out for those articles proposing that red wine is good for blood pressure and cling to the glamorous champagne habits of celebrities. Drinking among the middle-aged middle classes has not declined. In fact, while some of them might feel smug to have left their binge-drinking pasts behind, their regular daily consumption might be doing more damage to their bodies, not less. In 2015, Age Concern found that higher-income groups are “endangering” their health with their drinking habits. Figures show that mortality rates due to alcohol, among people aged 75 and over, have risen to their highest level since\u0026nbsprecords began in 1991.In fact, alcohol consumption is rising among the over-50s. This is a looming crisis for the NHS, health experts warn, as alcohol contributes to diseases such as Alzheimer’s, as well as a litany of cancers.But the fact is that those who are currently middle-aged may prove to\u0026nbspbe the last generation who of boozehounds. Just as young people are changing the worlds\u0026nbspof politics, technology and environmentalism, it is possible that this shift in the British attitude to alcohol will last the course. And further legislation and awareness is planned for the future. Next month, minimum alcohol unit pricing comes into force in Scotland.We are not alone in this cultural shift. While many countries, particularly our European cousins, have long had a mature attitude to drinking, Nicholls says that declining interest in alcohol, especially among\u0026nbspyoung people, is a worldwide trend. This is true even of countries that used to be big on the booze, such as Russia.We don’t know for sure, of course, that Britain will become a dry land in\u0026nbspyears to come – alcohol trends peak and trough, but it has never looked more likely than it does now. Drinks on me, then – it’s going to be a\u0026nbspcheap round."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ac0fdc7acc89c01103a5288af2a566cbd6565f8/0_363_5669_3402/master/5669.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74efb0a0712dc07a88d83d7711ffb315","title":"food banks norm trussell trust emma revie","story":"The Trussell Trust is arguably one of the charity “success” stories of the austerity years. Against a backdrop of escalating poverty, an obscure outfit giving out bags of food to a handful of hungry people in Wiltshire has grown, in less than a decade, into a highly visible campaigning voice overseeing a national network of more than 1,200 food bank outlets, staffed, largely, by thousands of volunteers, giving out more than a\u0026nbspmillion food parcels each year. Its\u0026nbsprapid rise is both impressive and alarming, and Trussell itself realises it has reached a watershed moment: at what point does endless growth represent mission failure for an anti‑poverty charity?The seemingly unstoppable rise in demand has created the logistical headache of how to ensure enough food is available in food banks to cope with this new wave of hunger and destitution. But it also raises more profound questions: should Trussell continue to try to run even faster to catch the increasing numbers of people falling through the gaping cracks in the welfare state safety net? Is it in danger of becoming an informal part of a dysfunctional social security system? And, even if it wants to reverse the expansion of\u0026nbsprecent years, how can it possibly do that without abandoning its core, faith‑driven mission of feeding the\u0026nbsppoor?“What I love about the Trussell Trust approach is that there is not an\u0026nbspacceptance that we are a safety net that will always be there,” says Revie, who joined the trust this year after a career in youth and overseas aid charities. “We have to be there because the statutory safety net has too many holes in it. We will catch as many as we can, but we want to not be here.” Trussell, she says, will never become “a pseudo-safety net that lets the state off the hook”.Trussell was for some years ostentatiously ignored by Department for Work and Pensions ministers for whom food banks were a political embarrassment now, says Revie, “very effective communications channels” are in place. Although for years the government has doggedly resisted changing course on welfare, Revie points to Trussell’s recent success – alongside many other organisations – in demonstrating how the flawed design and implementation of universal credit was driving debt, hunger, ill-health and eviction among the poorest claimants. That forced the government to introduce a few relatively minor tweaks to the system. It is too early to tell whether these have had any effect on food bank use. Revie – who says universal credit is “not fit for purpose” as a safety net – is clear that further changes are crucial.Trussell’s approach is three-pronged: to support its food bank outlets to provide emergency food to expand its food bank-based More Than Food services to provide debt, benefits and health advice to tackle some of the underlying issues that create food bank reliance and, in the form of its forthcoming three-year State of Hunger research project, to\u0026nbspbuild a powerful evidence base to\u0026nbspdemonstrate what policy changes need to take place to end the need for food banks.Revie admits it was a “hard decision” to partner with Asda. But ultimately, she argues, it brings in “transformational” levels of resources, with no strings attached. “The nature of our relationship is that they have asked us what things would really make a difference and they have agreed to fund that. And obviously there is a benefit to Asda from that relationship but we have not signed up to stop speaking truth to power – we will continue to.”One of the concerns of poverty campaigners is that food banks, five years ago such an appalling novelty, are now becoming grimly accepted as a “normal” part of the austerity scenery. Revie believes that the British public are still discomfited by the idea of food banks, and wants Trussell to ensure this remains so. “It’s really important to continue to be affronted by the fact people are having to go to food banks because they don’t have enough money to buy food,” she says. “We will keep telling that story.”Family: Married with two boys.Education: Crieff high school, Strathclyde University, Glasgow (BA in German and European studies).Career: 2018- present: chief executive, the Trussell Trust 2016-18: chief executive, Ambition 2010-16: chief executive, Reynolds Training 2005-09: chief executive, Landmark Training 2000-05: head of supporter and donor services, Tearfund 1998-2000: customer satisfaction manager (EMEA), IBM.Public life: Treasurer of Centre for Youth Impact.Interests: Spending time with family and friends, reading, and walking the dog."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f96b5ca75c76c48827dea05932bd5be727931904/0_205_6964_4179/master/6964.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5f2938e405574a0a3fe3fd077548147","title":"food bank use trussell trust universal credit figures","story":"Vulnerable people left with “nowhere else to turn” after experiencing problems with universal credit helped fuel a big increase in food bank use over the past year, according to the Trussell Trust.The trust said many universal credit claimants had come to food banks after long waits for payment and administrative problems pushed them into debt, ill health and rent arrears.“This completely unacceptable. We need to move towards a UK where no one needs a food bank’s help, not a country where charity provision is the only defence from utter destitution,” said Emma Revie, the trust’s chief executive.Research into the experiences of food bank users published by the trust on Tuesday found a “significant scale” of poor benefits administration, coupled with widespread evidence that universal credit provided insufficient income to cover basic living costs.Claimants reported they found the digital-only universal credit service hard to navigate, with little or no official support or financial assistance to help them cope or tide them over a minimum six-week wait for a first payment. Several told the trust that lack of money meant they had been forced to give up a home internet connection or smartphone, making it harder to access the benefit.The report says: “Rather than acting as a service to ensure people do not face destitution, the evidence suggests that for people on the very lowest incomes … the poor functioning of universal credit can actually push people into a tide of bills, debts and, ultimately, lead them to a food bank.“People are falling through the cracks in a system not made to hold them. What little support available is primarily offered by the third sector, whose work is laudable, but cannot be a substitute for a real, nationwide safety net.”The trust called for an urgent inquiry into the administration of universal credit and an end to the benefits freeze, as well as more practical help for the poorest claimants.The trust surveyed 284 users of 30 food banks in England, Scotland and Wales during February and March. Disabled people, claimants affected by chronic health conditions and families with dependent children were especially vulnerable to problems arising from the design or operation of universal credit.The Department for Work and Pensions criticised the survey as a “small self-selecting sample” carried out before a series of changes came into force designed to mitigate the impact of universal credit, such as reducing the minimum wait for a first payment to five weeks and providing two weeks’ extra housing support for claimants moving on to the benefit.Ministers were forced to introduce the changes last year after sustained criticism from campaigners, landlords, opposition parties and even Conservative backbenchers.The trust said the fastest-growing group of food bank users over the past year was made up of people reliant on benefits for income, suggesting the government’s freeze on social security benefits for the past two years was making it increasingly hard for the poorest to meet basic living costs.Revie said: “It’s hard to break free from hunger if there isn’t enough money coming in to cover the rising cost of absolute essentials like food and housing. For too many people, staying above water is a daily struggle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0879032447d559807fb111c6ae6a72decf11f6f/0_138_3824_2295/master/3824.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe25439492ff6516d4d7f000e676c50c","title":"ecb in firing line over 100 ball torunament","story":"The England and Wales Cricket Board will meet representatives from the country’s 420 professional players next month following a backlash over its new 100‑ball competition.The announcement last week that the ECB’s new eight-team tournament from 2020 would not be played using Twenty20 but rather a reduced version of the format is understood to have caused anger and disbelief among committee members of the Professional Cricketers Association.The player representatives from the 18 first-class counties that comprise this panel, along with two from the men’s and women’s national teams, were given 24 hours’ notice via a WhatsApp group that a big development was coming, but were offered no detail beyond this advisory.When news of The Hundred then came to light on Thursday, the thread is said to have gone into meltdown with a string of negative responses from around the county squads that reflected disappointment at the new format and annoyance that it had been presented publicly as a fait\u0026nbspaccompli.One PCA representative said that words such as “joke” and “gimmick” dominated the exchange, with derision over the format’s 10-ball over that, after 15 traditional six-ball overs, takes each innings to a round 100. Durham’s PCA representative, Chris Rushworth, tweeted: “What a load of bollocks.”There is also frustration that, having previously been sold a glamorous T20 tournament to rival the Indian Premier League or Australia’s Big Bash League, the players were now getting a huge unknown that also goes against the principle of domestic cricket mirroring that played at international level.In response to the news last week the PCA chairman, Daryl Mitchell, released a statement that confirmed he and the PCA non-executive chairman, Matthew Wheeler, had met the ECB three weeks earlier, when the 100‑ball concept was first floated, but had simply agreed to be “open-minded”.The statement added that the PCA would now begin a consultation process with its members but there is a suspicion among the county representatives as to why the debate is being held after the event. The ECB will now meet them at Edgbaston on 8\u0026nbspMay to go over the plans but faces a tough sell.It comes at a tricky time for the union, too, with the chief executive, David Leatherdale, signed off for personal reasons and continuing resentment among members over the loss of the increment contract system that rewarded players with a cash sum after totting up a set number of international appearances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad806ae3f0dee2bf55db8817cf1a99861aa2939a/0_86_2616_1570/master/2616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1ae67de1f73d890ddb48cb77bf0c18","title":"mo farah london marathon return 2019","story":"London Marathon organisers are already lining up Mo Farah to run in next year’s race while his coach, Gary Lough, believes he could yet reach a “similar level” as the winner this year, Eliud Kipchoge.The 35-year-old Farah is yet to decide on his next race over 26.2 miles but the likelihood is he will choose an autumn marathon in Chicago or New York – with Dubai in January an outside bet – before returning to the British capital next April. It is a prospect which one senior London Marathon figure told the  they “would love to see happen”.Lough believes the performance on Sunday showed that, while Kipchoge – who has not lost since 2013 – is the greatest in history, Farah is capable of putting him under pressure by running a time of 2hr\u0026nbsp3min or 2:04 in the future.“Eliud is the best marathon runner ever,” Lough said. “But I think Mo can get to a similar level – of being either one or two in the world. And if you put him into a championship environment, like next year in the world championships in Doha or certainly the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, I definitely think Mo should be someone people have got major concerns about. He wants to be the best that he can be – and that is going to be one of the best in the world.”Farah’s agent, Ricky Simms, meanwhile, has dismissed any suggestions that the runner’s former coach Alberto Salazar, who remains under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency, played any part in the 35-year-old’s success in London.Simms also suggested that there was obvious room for improvement in Farah’s time of 2:06:21 – and that, if he had not had gone off so quickly in temperatures that hit 24C (75F) or had problems with his water bottles, he might have recorded a faster time.“Mo has shown he can be a very good marathon runner,” Simms said. “On Sunday he ran 61 minutes for the first half and 64 for the second. If he goes through halfway in 62 or 62:15, I would love to have seen how he came back, because the fast early pace and missing his bottles meant he lost a lot of time at the end.”Simms paid tribute to Farah, who some had thought was doing the London Marathon purely for a final payday after retiring from the track last September. “I have been with him on track races when he has not been fit and he has still been able to grind it out and win,” he said.“He has got such determination. He won’t lie down. He has been winning for a number of years. He likes winning. He does not like not winning as much as anyone as I have met, so that determination to keep winning is there. He has a pride to do\u0026nbspwell.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53b2dcbcb1fdc46edf453311a2289718f4c2afb5/617_617_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960fabef9ca09e75055fa120ae538b76","title":"baz luhrmann strictly ballroom the musical interview","story":"His frenetic hip-hop history The Get Down may have floundered but there’s no stopping the director. He talks about his Elvis movie, his boho love life – and resurrecting Strictly Ballroom for the stageThe sun is out and so is Baz Luhrmann. We meet at the Piccadilly theatre, home to the new stage version of his splendidly camp comedy-musical Strictly Ballroom, but he insists on heading to a nearby park. A publicist and assistant march ahead of us, clearing a path and stopping the London traffic. “This is the best idea ever!” Luhrmann announces, offering his bare arms to the sun. We find a bench near rows of gaily coloured tulips that are in danger of being upstaged by the 55-year-old, with his silver quiff and sunglasses, short-sleeved lemon-coloured floral shirt, pinstriped trousers and gleaming white trainers (no socks). Luhrmann has the air of a princeling about him, but it would be churlish to say he hasn’t earned it. Strictly Ballroom, his film debut, arrived in 1992 in a haze of sequins, satin and hairspray, although it looks positively austere now, compared to the director’s following films. Romeo + Juliet, which reimagined Shakespeare for the ecstasy generation, remains the daring pinnacle of his career. He calls it “the most romantic film-making experience I’ve ever had. Someone should make a film about us making that film. Can you imagine? Leo DiCaprio was 19, we’re all living in Mexico, there are helicopters and explosions and we’re doing iambic pentameter! I’ve never waited for permission to do anything. People just say, ‘He’s a bit crazy, but let’s give it a go.’” Moulin Rouge was next, a hectic musical edited at stroboscopic speed with the sounds of U2, Elton John and Nirvana ringing out across fin-de-siècle Paris. After Australia, a self-consciously old-fashioned epic, he was back to his breakneck self with a bells-and-whistles spin on The Great Gatsby, complete with Jay Z-produced soundtrack. Purists were aghast, though the film made $354m worldwide. But Luhrmann’s 1970s-set origins-of-hip-hop series The Get Down was cancelled last year by Netflix, after a single season that was rumoured to have cost $190m. The production was subject to so many interruptions that it reportedly became known as The Shut Down. When he couldn’t commit to a second series due to film-making obligations, Netflix pulled the plug. “I was just gonna be the uncle to it,” he says. “What they didn’t know was how to use music in storytelling, so I went in deep, as I always do.“I’m the least likely person who should’ve done the birth of hip-hop, but I’m also the least likely one to film America’s greatest novel or turn the Moulin Rouge into a musical. I’m from a tiny country town. I’m from the planet Audience. I’m far away, gazing at everything, and it all looks amazing to me. Still!” Luhrmann is weighing up which of two projects – one a “Chinese-y” western, the other an Elvis movie – to begin first. At any particular time, he might be found managing the opening of a luxury mall, launching his own vodka or orchestrating the Christmas window display at Barney’s in New York. “I’ve always been spread too thin,” he says.Strictly Ballroom, though, is where it all began. It started out as a 20-minute devised theatre piece, staged when Lurhmann was studying at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney. The reaction was ecstatic. He had already taken acting jobs to fund his first theatre company – he played a pig-seller-turned-hearse-driver in the Aussie daytime soap A Country Practice – but the response to Strictly Ballroom persuaded him to give that up. “I knew for good or bad I would be making shows for the rest of my life.”There were several iterations of Strictly Ballroom, including a Brechtian one, punctuated by speeches from Reagan and Thatcher. “What I was trying to do, in my ham-fisted way, was connect the idea that, whether it’s ballroom dancing or politics, there will always be some carnival barker saying there’s only one way to cha-cha-cha.”When he filmed Strictly Ballroom, Luhrmann was already a theatre and opera wunderkind, with a rulebook-shredding La Bohème (later revived on Broadway) to his name. The current stage incarnation, which debuted in Sydney three years ago, lifts everything from the movie, including the costumes designed by Luhrmann’s wife, multiple Oscar-winner Catherine Martin, and the ugly duckling plot, in which spotty misfit Fran pairs off with rebellious hoofer Scott to overturn the staid conventions of ballroom dancing upheld by fearsome federation president Barry Fife. New trimmings include a rollerskating MC, winningly played by Will Young in a gly catsuit, and an eclectic, Moulin Rouge-style soundtrack resulting in such did-I-hear-that-right? moments as a medley incorporating Public Enemy’s Fight the Power and REM’s It’s the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine). Luhrmann is energised by the oddball. “People don’t come to the theatre to watch you be careful.”That’s the whole point of the show, as suggested by its signature line: “A life lived in fear is a life half-lived.” (Luhrmann admits he borrowed it from the late-1970s martial arts show Monkey.) The similarities between him and Scott are clear – like his protagonist, Luhrmann was a ballroom dancer from the age of six, while the establishment’s objections to Scott’s “flashy, crowd-pleasing steps” now sound like reviews for any one of the director’s films.Watching the production a few days ago, though, he felt more like Fran than Scott. “The ugly duckling myth isn’t about transformation. This is a cygnet who by accident finds herself among ducklings, so it’s about self-revelation. In that regard, I think I’m only getting started.” Luhrmann was raised in the seven-house town of Herons Creek, 225 miles north of Sydney, where his family owned a farm and a gas station. His father was a navy man who had fought in Vietnam, his mother a dance teacher. Parenting was an unconventional mixture of the artistic and the military: “Ballroom dancing and commando training,” as he puts it. “Whether we were working or breeding fish or waterskiing or scuba ing, it was wall-to-wall activity. Relentless.” There have been plenty of Barry Fifes in his own life, he says. “They’re everywhere. There’s a few winks to a current one in the show.” Barry, who harbours political aspirations, sported a garish flap of orange hair as far back as the original film. “Ahead of the curve, right?” Luhrmann laughs. He thinks that’s true of all his work.“My films are usually like baby seals, and everyone is trying to club them to death. But I was always making things for the future. I didn’t want to be hip and groovy for a brief moment. I was hoping it would move through time and geography.” He feels an affinity with his friend and compatriot Kylie Minogue, whom he cast in Moulin Rouge as the Green Fairy. “People were so vicious to Kylie. They called her talentless. But she has prevailed.” As has Luhrmann. His influence is everywhere in popular culture. To take one small example, there’s the word “Strictly”, which in the early 2000s was tacked on to a reboot of the late-night dancing contest Come Dancing. “A lady at the BBC loved the film and tried to get a TV version made that didn’t happen,” says Luhrmann, who has appeared as a judge on the US version, Dancing With the Stars. “I was terrible. My whole life is about helping artists be better, not saying, ‘You suck.’” He and Martin – whom he calls CM – live with their two children, aged 12 and 14. Whether at their homes in New York or Sydney, husband and wife inhabit different floors and sleep separately, convening at the weekend for a hotel date night. Do they still have sex? “Yeah, we do. And you know what? She rocks out. She’s a bit of a wolf. She always dresses up in strange costumes.” And him? “Look, it’s never gonna be like when you were 20. I’m not saying it’s boring, but it becomes part of the ceremony: the intimacy, the talk afterwards. Our relationship is full of acceptance. She knew who I was going in, and I knew who she was. Without going into details, we’ve lived a pretty boho life. There’s nothing about either of us that the other one doesn’t know. We have our way, and that works for us.” They met in the late 1980s and were married in 1997. Martin, though, didn’t know him when he was plain Mark Anthony Luhrmann. Where did the Baz come from? “I had this crazy curly hair, this big ’fro, and at school there were all these boys in their uniforms who used to beat the shit out of me. They called me Basil Brush and the name stuck. At some point I changed it by deed poll.” So he reclaimed the insult, in other words, just as gay people did with the word queer? “I didn’t think about it at the time, but that’s exactly what happened. ‘I’m Baz! And you’ll be hearing from me!’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc0acb89ef8b8af9b4bd9fdc0eedebf2b258df8e/0_262_6128_3677/master/6128.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=716f8165bfd37ed18482a231871f7a2c","title":"salton sea bombay beach desert town artist influx","story":"Bombay Beach, once a desert resort, fell into decrepitude. Now an influx of artists, intellectuals and hipsters are making it their playground When ecological disaster hit Bombay Beach, a resort town marooned by a dying lake in California’s desert, the result looked apocalyptic.Birds and fish died. Toxic dust swirled. The air stank. Tourists and most residents fled, leaving a virtual ghost town of abandoned, decaying homes. For decades the only regular visitors were film-makers who came to shoot horror flicks about zombies and Armageddon.Now, Bombay Beach, population 295, is enjoying a rebirth of sorts with an influx of artists, intellectuals and hipsters who have turned it into a bohemian playground.There is an opera house, a gallery, an “Hermitage” museum, a conceptual pavilion and a drive-in movie theatre. Which sounds rather grand, but the desert wind whistles through the cracks and it looks like Mad Max did the decorating.The closest thing to a hotel – a shipping container with plywood floors and walls – is adorned with photographs of the criminally insane.There are also giraffe sculptures, a defunct sensory deprivation tank, a four-dimensional hypercube called a tesseract and a fake particle accelerator made of gold-painted junk. Plus a festival, the Bombay Beach Biennale, with exhibitions, philosophy seminars, ballet and poetry. Sandstorms and scorching sun can make it feel closer to Mars than Venice’s biennale.“People are engaging with the idea of creating this outpost of freedom and creativity. Hopefully it just stays authentic and weird,” Tao Ruspoli, a photographer, musician and film-maker who has led the charge, said last week, giving the  a tour.Ruspoli, 42, started coming in 2007, making the three-hour drive from Los Angeles, and friends followed, intrigued by his declaration that here was the most interesting town in America.Several have bought property – trailers, bungalows and empty lots – as homes, studios and exhibition spaces. “We don’t want it to be a passing thing. We want to leave a mark, though with the knowledge that everything is impermanent. We’re attacked from all directions – vandalism, extreme heat, 50 mph winds,” said Ruspoli, who is also the son of an Italian prince.He considers the corporate razzmatazz of the Coachella festival, 40 miles north, the antithesis of the “Dadaist” experiment unfolding in Bombay Beach, which has little commerce besides two grocery stores and two bars. The nearest gas station is 20 miles away.Even so, an influx of artists who buy property and push up prices may sound ominous to those pushed out of homes by gentrification in formerly run-down parts of Brooklyn, Oakland and Los Angeles. Some activists say artists pave a path for moneyed investors and speculators.Prices are rising in Bombay Beach. Some bungalows which cost a few thousand dollars 15 years ago now fetch tens of thousands of dollars.“They’re buying up all the old stuff, it seems like they’re taking over,” grumbled an 80-year-old customer at the Ski Inn bar, who gave his name only as Wacko. “A lot of the buildings are painted ridiculous colours.” Vandalism and petty theft has hit some exhibits, suggesting there are additional detractors.Still, Wacko appeared to be in a minority. Of a dozen residents interviewed at random, 11 welcomed the bohemians. “The town was dying. They’re bringing in young people, fixing places up,” said Mark Hagedorn, 65. “It’s a shot in the arm,” said Ernest Hawkins, 75. “This place used to rock. Then it went to sleep. Everyone left or got old.” Lisa Trujill, 52, a housepainter, said she wanted more music, more arts. “I love it.”A 2012 award-winning documentary chronicled some of the town’s lost souls. Without wind, from a distance, Bombay Beach looks ravishing. It sits by the Salton Sea, California’s biggest lake, a 360 sq mile swath of tranquil water ringed by white beaches.Appearances deceive – the lake is dying. It formed in 1905 when the Colorado river breached a canal and poured into this dry desert basin, creating a habitat for hundreds of species of fish and birds. Bombay Beach and a few other resorts sprang up and thrived in the 1950s. Then growing salinity and agricultural pollution killed the fish. Their bones are what makes the beaches white. Hunger and disease ravaged the birds. The lake is receding, leaving winds to whip up toxic, odiferous soil. The smell can travel far, notably in a 2012 event known as “the big burp”.State authorities announced a plan last year to restore some of the lake, the first phase of a long-promised rescue. Skeptics fear it will never happen.The Bombay Beach Biennale – which despite the name has taken place each year – riffs on its environs. The first in 2016 was themed on the “art of decay”. The 2017 festival asked artists to imagine the future that did not happen. This year, held over a weekend in March and aided by a Getty foundation grant, was themed “God’s silence”.Melody Sample, 31, built a “dream house” installation in a ruined bungalow which included a bathtub and a table set for high tea. “The energy here is really fresh. It’s like a forgotten place in a death, rebirth cycle,” she said. This applies to her exhibit: thieves stole the benches and incense and other artifacts, leaving the dream house somewhat forlorn.Stefan Ashkenazy, who owns the Petit Ermitage hotel in West Hollywood, is Bombay Beach’s svengali. He has bought several abandoned lots and brings in artists to transform them.He arrived last week at the wheel of an open-top Mercedes playing Bizet. The appeal was not property but experience, he said. “Of all the things I do this is the most free, the most inspiring.” He wants to turn E street into a cultural hub to host, among other things, film premieres at the drive-in which is populated with vintage, wrecked cars. Wacko, the refusenik, was not impressed. “They wouldn’t allow that in LA. Down here they get away with it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b90afdac0e631f57175ca18791bce102a2087e2c/0_26_1179_707/master/1179.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cc1b799ba32d45302e89c923fec2bf2","title":"azerbaijan ruling families linked to secret investments via maltese bank","story":"President’s children among alleged beneficiaries of multimillion-pound global investments by networks of companiesAzerbaijan’s ruling families are the alleged beneficiaries of dozens of anonymously owned companies that have been used to invest in property, hotels and businesses in Europe, according to an investigation by the Daphne Project.Over the past three years, several networks of companies appear to have used a private bank in Malta for secret investments in the UK, Spain, France, Georgia and Montenegro, research by the project found. Many of the companies were allegedly operated for the benefit of the children of Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan’s president, and the sons of his minister for emergency situations, Kamaladdin Heydarov, according to three sources with knowledge of the transactions.Their claims are supported by information in the public domain, and a leak from Dubai residency records.Aliyev’s daughters, Leyla and Arzu Aliyeva, did not respond to a request for comment.Lawyers for Heydarov’s sons, Nijat and Tale, said: “Our clients are the beneficial owners of companies … which have entirely legitimate and lawful business.”Although there is no suggestion of wrongdoing, the disclosures are likely to raise new questions for Azerbaijan’s ruling elites, who have been widely criticised for a lack of transparency since Aliyev took power in 2003.He has been accused of presiding over a regime that has imprisoned journalists, committed human rights abuses and allowed looting of state assets by public officials. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has repeatedly called for the country to be more open and provide greater transparency as part of necessary anti-corruption measures.The president has denounced any criticism of his government as a “smear” and accused western media of waging a “biased, groundless and provocative” campaign against Azerbaijan’s leaders.The investigation shows the breadth of previously unreported investments owned by some of the elite, and how Malta has been used as a gateway for them to buy and manage assets across Europe and the rest of the world.At the heart of the network are companies that were clients of Pilatus bank, whose headquarters are in Malta and assets are frozen pending the outcome of an investigation initiated by the country’s banking regulator last month.The information appears to show for the first time that the president’s daughters own a half share in Gilan Holding, one of Azerbaijan’s largest businesses, with interests in banking, construction, tourism, agriculture and Gabala football club.Gilan Holding was founded by Heydarov in the 1980s and became one of Azerbaijan’s most successful companies before being handed to his sons, before Heydarov entered government.Assets allegedly held by the families through companies that were customers of Pilatus bank include:The Maltese regulator has declined to comment on the focus of its inquiry at Pilatus, and there is no suggestion those named in this article acted illegally. A collaboration of 18 news organisations, including the , Reuters and the New York Times, has been researching Pilatus. Led by France’s Forbidden Stories, the Daphne Project was created to continue the investigations of Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.A fearless anti-corruption journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia’s reporting came to international attention with her exposes in the 2016 Panama Papers project.On 16 October the following year, the Maltese reporter was murdered by a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of her car.The Daphne Project was created to continue her investigations. It is a collaboration of 18 media organisations in 15 different countries, including the , Reuters, Le Monde and the New York Times.The project is the first to be led by\u0026nbspForbidden Stories, an international network of journalists who stand ready to take over when colleagues are silenced through imprisonment or murder.The project will publish a series of fresh revelations, setting out the dangers that alleged political corruption and poor controls on money laundering inside Malta pose to law and order in Europe.Fifty companies and trusts, almost all of which are owned anonymously, have been traced. They appear to belong to at least five separate groupings of companies, whose key entities were incorporated in Malta from the summer of 2014 onwards.Pilatus, the bank for many of the companies, opened its headquarters in the European Union’s smallest member state in January 2014.Azeri-controlled accounts at Pilatus are frozen, along with those of all other customers. The measures followed the arrest of the bank’s Iranian owner in Washington in March. Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad is in custody awaiting prosecution for alleged money laundering and sanctions violations in relation to his business affairs before arriving in Malta.The Pilatus scandal surfaced last year when an employee blew the whistle on the bank. Her claims, first reported by Caruana Galizia and later repeated to a European parliament inquiry, were that the customers of Pilatus included Leyla Aliyeva and Maltese politicians. The claims surfaced at a time when Azerbaijan was completing a major investment in the Maltese energy sector through a share in a power station.Two sources with knowledge of Pilatus transactions have confirmed her testimony: they say the Aliyev and Heydarov families were clients. Keith Schembri, the chief of staff of Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, has also confirmed he was a client.In response to a letter from the , lawyers for the Heydarov sons stated: “Our clients are the beneficial owners of companies which hold accounts at Pilatus bank in Malta, which have entirely legitimate and lawful business.” They say the structure was set up to hold European property and assets, and their ownership in many cases was in the public domain. “Where it is not, there are legitimate public-interest reasons to keep the fact of ownership private, for example where the companies hold property used by our clients for residential purposes, that ownership may be kept private for security reasons,” the lawyers said.Robert Baker, an Australian who lives in Britain, appears as a director of dozens of entities with Pilatus accounts. Public filings list his address as a £2m house in west London.The largest grouping of companies, owned by the Heydarov brothers via anonymous New Zealand holding companies set up as recently as November, has invested tens of millions of pounds in European assets.These include a €3.9m (£3.4m) villa in Marbella and the $2.5m purchase of a former sanatorium in Georgia, which reports say is to be developed into a 100-room hotel at a cost of $40m.The brothers own three French artisanal businesses: a maker of china plates in Limoges for high-end restaurants, another producing cartoon character figurines, and a supplier of bed linen to the Élysée Palace. The linen company, D Porthault, hosted a visit by Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president, last autumn.Despite repeated requests for information, the  understands that managers of these businesses, all acquired in 2014 and 2015, were never told who their ultimate owner was. The manager of the Limoges factory told the newspaper Le Monde, a partner in the Daphne Project: “It’s incredible, it’s been three years now that my questions have gone unanswered.”Two London townhouses worth a combined £16m belong to a New Zealand company called Kubernao Trust Limited, which has a Pilatus account. Baker is a former shareholder, according to public company records, and is still listed as a director. It is not known who ultimately owns the properties because their identity is hidden behind a New Zealand nominee.Lawyers for Baker said their client was “appalled” by the murder of Caruana Galizia and he had “at all times acted with the utmost good faith and integrity, and where appropriate, sought the assistance of the appropriate experts”.They declined to comment on the ownership of the companies of which Baker was a director, saying: “Confidentiality, privacy and discretion are the fundamental requirements for service providers in the consultation, management and administration of family funds and private banking.”One of the biggest revelations is that the Aliyev daughters may have a majority stake in Gilan. The Heydarov family have always presented the conglomerate as theirs. However, two sources with knowledge of Pilatus transactions have now confirmed that the owners of Sahra FZCO were declared to Pilatus as Leyla and Arzu Aliyeva.Asked about the ownership, lawyers for the Heydarov brothers said their clients would not comment “for confidentiality and security reasons”. Property records, obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, show Sahra holds two plots on Dubai’s Palm Jumeirah island.The plots are occupied by the 360-room Sofitel Dubai resort. While the family is understood to own the building, the hotel is managed by Accor. It appears that Accor, a top 40 company on the Paris bourse, is a partner with Aliyev interests in a total of three hotels. Sahra appears to have been connected through a franchise arrangement with another Accor hotel in Dubai, the Mercure Barsha Heights. And the French group operates the Fairmont in Baku, previously reported as being linked to the Aliyevs.Accor said it could not ulge details of commercial relationships.Additional reporting by Miranda Patrucic, Khadija Ismayilova, Jean-Baptiste Chastand and Anne Michel"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1610b2d3261a646b1cd5a2ae1b070109f026a9a/0_0_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859aa070365e05059f39ad0977a7d320","title":"finland to end basic income trial after two years","story":"Government rejects request for funds to expand scheme and plans stricter benefits rulesEurope’s first national government-backed experiment in giving citizens free cash will end next year after Finland decided not to extend its widely publicised basic income trial and to explore alternative welfare schemes instead.Since January 2017, a random sample of 2,000 unemployed people aged 25 to 58 have been paid a monthly €560 (£475) , with no requirement to seek or accept employment. Any recipients who took a job continued to receive the same amount.The government has turned down a request for extra funding from Kela, the Finnish social security agency, to expand the two-year pilot to a group of employees this year, and said payments to current participants will end next January.It has also introduced legislation making some benefits for unemployed people contingent on taking training or working at least 18 hours in three months. “The government is making changes taking the system away from basic income,” Kela’s Miska Simanainen told the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. The scheme – aimed primarily at seeing whether a guaranteed income might incentivise people to take up paid work by smoothing out gaps in the welfare system – is strictly speaking not a universal basic income (UBI) trial, because the payments are made to a restricted group and are not enough to live on.But it was hoped it would shed light on policy issues such as whether an unconditional payment might reduce anxiety among recipients and allow the government to simplify a complex social security system that is struggling to cope with a fast-moving and insecure labour market.Olli Kangas, an expert involved in the trial, told the Finnish public broadcaster YLE: “Two years is too short a period to be able to draw extensive conclusions from such a big experiment. We should have had extra time and more money to achieve reliable results.”The idea of UBI – appealing both to the left, which hopes it can cut poverty and inequality, and to the right, which sees it as a possible route to a leaner, less bureaucratic welfare system – has gained traction recently amid predictions that automation could threaten up to a third of current jobs.The Finnish finance minister, Petteri Orpo, told Hufvudstadsbladet he was looking into trialling alternative welfare schemes, including a universal credit system similar to that being introduced in the UK, when the basic income pilot ends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6454fb178ac9a6d7fcb41c80b6eacba7f1925be/393_808_5226_3135/master/5226.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b29e2d29f5e967dda17aad4b8a48a29","title":"how a vampire squid inspired a goldman prize winning marine life champion","story":"European winner of the Goldman environment prize switched from journalism to activism to tackle the destructive practice of deep-sea bottom trawlingIt was a vampire squid that inspired the European winner of this year’s Goldman environmental prize to successfully challenge the devastatingly unsustainable practice of bottom-trawling.More than a decade before Blue Planet, Claire Nouvian was researching this rare creature – a living fossil that is found 4,000m below the surface of Monterey Bay – for a French television company, when she first realised the extraordinary variety of life and colour on the deep ocean floor.The joy of that discovery was quickly followed by horror when she realised how quickly this landscape – formed over centuries – was being turned into a desert as a result of industrial fishing.Deep-sea bottom trawlers drag heavy nets with steel doors and roller gear across the ocean floor, decimating ancient coral, mussel colonies, sponges, sea worms and many species that live long and breed too slowly to replenish their numbers. The technique has been compared to the clear-cutting of forests because the heavy doors – some of which weigh several tonnes and are marketed as canyonbusters – scrape the tops off of seamounts and rugged terrain.Determined to challenge this, Nouvian switched from journalism to activism, founded the Bloom Association  in 2005, and began a campaign that recently resulted in a major policy shift by the European Union.She describes her strategy as an application of investigative journalism. She first identified the problem, honed in on the causes, interviewed the major players and then sieved through reams of data to expose the ecological and economic flaws of the business.“Deep-sea bottom trawling applies the most destructive fishing to the most fragile ecosystem,” Nouvian told the  in an interview ahead of the Goldman award ceremony. “The seafloor has intricate features that form over years, like cities. Bottom trawling wipes it out.”Nouvian initially focused attention on a fishing fleet owned by Intermarché, a French supermarket chain. Her association sifted through years of corporate accounts and discovered that the fleet was chronically unprofitable even with public subsidies. In partnership with other NGOs, they also canvassed former fishing communities in France and the UK to see how fishing port communities were being ruined by industrial trawling.This was followed by a petition calling on the government to ban a practice that was environmentally destructive and economically unviable. With the help of a viral cartoon on the subject by acclaimed French illustrator Pénélope Bagieu, more than 900,000 people signed up, forcing first Intermarché, then the French and UK governments, then the European parliament and council to agree on restrictions. From June 2016, European fleets have been banned from bottom trawling at depths of more than 800m.Nouvian is now targeting pulse fishing, which uses electric currents to stun fish or induce spasms that force sole and plaice from the sediment.“This is terrifying. If we electrocute fish, we also electrocute eggs and everything else. All life in a certain space is wiped out. It sounds like science fiction, but it is real.”Under pressure from Bloom, other NGOs and small-scale fishermen’s groups, the European parliament voted to prohibit pulse fishing inside EU waters earlier this year.But she says it continues on a wide scale because the European commission is failing to enforce regulations while the EU institutions make a final ruling on whether pulse fishing should be prohibited.Nouvian has called on supermarkets to refuse to stock electric-caught fish but so far in the UK only Waitrose, Co-op and Morrisons have agreed, while Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Marks and Spencers have not replied. French retailers – who have learned not to cross this formidable campaigner – have been more responsive.The prize-winner – who complains there is only 20 hours to work in a day – is also working to ban shark-finning in Asia and lobbying the World Trade Organisation and governments around the world to end subsidies for destructive industrial fishing and to give more support to small-scale fishing communities.“There are way too many big fishing vessels and they are kept afloat with public subsidies. But there are fewer fish so they have to go further, enter deeper waters and take more types of fish,” she said. “We have the means to wipe out other species and us with it, but just because we can it does not mean we have to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f44dadc1440a24c191c6b2bef580c3465727943/0_61_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eb63a6b9edfdc78d267a67edd24fc35","title":"paraguay election mario abdo benitez victory","story":"Abdo Benítez, son of Alfredo Stroessner’s private secretary, defeats centre-left coalition in narrow win for the rightAn election campaign that revived memories of Paraguay’s bloody 1954-89 dictatorship has ended with Mario Abdo Benítez – son of the private secretary to Alfredo Stroessner – narrowly snatching victory from a centre-left coalition.Abdo Benitez, 46 – from a conservative wing of the ruling Colorado Party – thanked his opponent – Efraín Alegre, 55, of the Alianza grouping – for a “healthy competition”. Abdo Benítez promised to work for national unity.“From today, useless ision is finished. The debate is over,” he said in a victory speech on Sunday. “We’re builders, and all are welcome who want to build the future of this fatherland.”Earlier in the day, the Colorado candidate, who was 17 and studying in the US when Stroessner was forced into exile, visited his father’s mausoleum – immediately next to the grave of South America’s longest-serving dictator. Abdo Benítez was a pallbearer at Stroessner’s funeral in 2006, entering politics in the same year after founding the “Peace and Progress” Colorado movement – named after Stroessner’s favoured slogan – with the dictator’s grandson.He defeated a technocratic candidate, Santiago Peña – the preferred successor of the current president, Horacio Cartes – in Colorado primaries in December, capturing the rural Colorado base through his opposition to Cartes’s debt-heavy economic model.On the trail, Abdo Benítez emphasised family values and hinted at enforcing obligatory military service. He repeatedly refused to condemn the dictatorship outright, expressing regret for the 425 people killed and nearly 19,000 tortured under Stroessner but emphasising what he called the “achievements” of the military regime. Yet for many Colorado voters, the dictatorship had little relevance for the election. “The issue of Stronismo, that’s from another era,” said Nelson Zamudio, a shopkeeper in the southeastern city of Coronel Oviedo.Many young people – well over half of the population – also have a hazy understanding of the Stroessner period. Mauricio Galeano, 18, was unsure how to mark his ballot for the first time. “With regard to dictatorship, yes, I think the law should be enforced,” he said, citing widespread fears about crime and insecurity.Yet Sunday’s vote didn’t entirely go as expected. Despite the polls routinely giving Abdo Benítez a lead of 10-25 points, results came down to the wire, with Alegre losing by just 3.7 points – the lowest margin since Paraguay’s return to democracy.The close result suggests that the end of Colorado hegemony – interrupted for only five years in the past 70 – is nigh, said Eduardo Nakayama, a historian and leader of the Alianza’s Liberal party. And Abdo Benítez will have to make “political compromises” to get anything through congress, said Claudia Pompa, a political analyst. Alianza and a crop of smaller parties have picked up more seats, denying the Colorados a majority.Activists have vowed to keep working to loosen the grip of Paraguay’s conservative political parties.“It’s very challenging, but we can’t do nothing,” said Gerónimo Ayala, a Mbyá Guaraní architect who narrowly missed out on being elected Paraguay’s first indigenous congressman. “The movement will continue. The struggle is worth it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb6309aa2eb6fbc997ddc586a3323976d22175a8/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90b343a6d2cbec2d368902d14eaff52a","title":"sprinkling sand save arctic shrinking sea ice","story":"Arctic Dispatches, part 3: A pilot project at a lake in northern Alaska is one of a number aiming to slow climate change with geoengineering – but some worry about unintended consequencesAs a test location for a project that aims to ensure the livability of Earth, a frozen lake near the northern tip of Alaska could seem rather inauspicious.While the North Meadow Lake near Utqiaġvik, formerly known as Barrow, may be relatively nondescript, it will be the staging ground this month for an ambitious attempt to safeguard the Arctic’s rapidly diminishing sea ice and stave off the most punishing effects of global warming.Tiny spheres of reflective sand will be sprinkled upon the lake to see if this can prevent the lake ice from melting or slow the process down. Should testing prove successful, the project, called Ice911, has the grand vision of slathering around 19,000 sq miles of sea ice – equivalent to the size of Costa Rica – with trillions of sand grains in order to stem the loss of ice cover and prevent runaway climate change.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“The ice in the Arctic isn’t going to come back by itself,” said Leslie Field, founder of Ice911. “And we don’t have much time left.”Field, a Silicon Valley engineer and researcher who worked for Chevron and HP, said she was inspired to intervene in the Arctic after seeing Al Gore’s climate change parable An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. “It hit me like a train,” she said. “The importance of the Arctic just leapt out to me.“I looked at it and thought: ‘What if this is a materials problem?’ You go through the list of things that aren’t adding pollution or foods to the environment and it’s a fairly short list. I’ve been through a few options and this one has legs.”For the past decade, Field has been testing out various materials that might provide a protective barrier to the winnowing sea ice, conducting tests in barrels of water in laboratories, on lakes in California and Canada, on a pond in Minnesota. Testing is now set to take place in the tundra of the Alaskan Arctic, near a research station where scientists generally observe changes in sea ice, rather than attempt to halt or reverse them. Scientists flock to Utqiaġvik to survey seabirds or gather data from boreholes in the tundra – there are about 80 beds in austere cabins at the Barrow Arctic Research Center and all will be full this summer.“Leslie is kind of a one-off,” said Nagruk Harcharek, a senior official at the Ukpeaġvik Iñupiat Corporation, which operates the research centre. “I think her dream is to go pretty big time. Whether that’s realistic and is going to save the world, I don’t know.”In March, the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that the Arctic had reached a seasonal maximum of 5.59m sq miles – the second-lowest peak extent in the 39-year satellite record. Scientists forecast that Arctic sea ice could completely vanish in summertime by the 2040s. The cost and logistics are daunting, however. It’s unclear how the sand grains will be distributed, although Field prefers the idea of ship-based deployment rather than using aircraft. Field isn’t targeting the whole Arctic region – instead focusing on areas such as Fram Strait, between Greenland and the Norwegian island of Svalbard – but the cost to festoon 19,000 sq miles of ice in silica would still be around $750m, not including labour.The continual funding for such an effort will have to come from private donors, or the UN, or perhaps the World Bank. That, too, isn’t certain as yet, despite a “large-scale launch” of ice covering earmarked for 2020.The world may have warmed by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world.In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. This past winter, the warmest on record in the Arctic, saw some locations exceed 20C hotter than normal.These “rapid and dramatic changes” are introducing a “new normal” to the Arctic, according to US government scientists in a report card last year. Storms are eroding away ice-free coastlines, summer wildfires are becoming fiercer and certain species, such as polar bears, are increasingly struggling to find food. This is all providing a major challenge to communities in the Arctic, but a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will get even simpler once the Arctic is ice free in summertimes, forecast as soon as 2040s.“It’s not chump change, but compared to other options it’s cost effective,” she said. “It’s a matter of trying to prevent the horrific list of things, such as sea level rise, storms and so on, that will come from climate change. Things that will cost us trillions, not billions.”Ice911 isn’t the only direct environmental intervention, known as geoengineering, plotted for the Arctic. A team of scientists at Arizona State University want to add an extra metre of sea ice to the Arctic’s current thickness by spending $500bn on a network of 10m wind-powered pumps that would be used to push seawater on to the surface of the ice where it would freeze.“Our only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels,” lead physicist Steven Desch said last year. “It’s a good idea but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic’s sea ice from disappearing.”In the Paris climate accords, world governments agreed to a 2C warming limit. Most plausible forecasts concede this won’t be possible with emissions reductions and renewable energy ramp-ups alone. Some sort of technology that captures carbon or removes it directly from the atmosphere will be needed. No such viable technology exists at any sort of scale, but a number of geoengineering projects of various hues (Field calls her option “soft” or “eco” geoengineering) have in recent years jostled to forge a breakthrough. There is the plan to use 16tn miniature robots to deflect the sun’s heat away from Earth or the project to pump aerosols into clouds in order to “brighten” them and bolster their reflective power. Another scheme, devised by the scientist who developed Australia’s polymer bank notes, is trialling a thin “sun shield” to be placed over parts of the Great Barrier Reef, which has recently suffered from severe coral bleaching. A separate project, led by the Harvard physicist David Keith, plans to head to Tuscon, Arizona, this year to launch the “StratoCruiser” – a high-altitude balloon equipped with sensors that will spray a mist of molecules such as sulfur dioxide or calcium carbonate into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight and spur cloud formation. Harvard’s solar geoengineering program has received funding from Bill Gates, among other sources.These and other similar projects have faced criticism over potential unintended pollution, as well as the even more hazardous prospect of handing countries a reason to slow down their emissions cuts in favour of a geoengineering panacea that may never arrive.János Pásztor, a former UN assistant secretary general for climate change, recently called for a pause in solar geoengineering so that unforeseen risks could be properly explored. In a speech to Arizona State University, Pásztor singled out Keith’s experiment. “Some time within the next year, we may see the world’s first outdoor experiment on stratospheric aerosol injection take place here in the skies above Arizona, yet for the most part governments are not aware of, nor addressing, the profound governance issues this poses,” he said.“We urgently need an open, inclusive discussion on how the world will research and govern solar geoengineering. Otherwise we could be in danger of events overtaking society’s capacity to respond prudently and effectively.”Some scientists are also wary about interventions to restore Arctic sea ice, broadly following the same precautionary principle that tweaking the composition of an ecosystem can have far-reaching ramifications, such as unleashing the cane toad in Australia or allowing feral hogs to run rampant in Texas. “I think there are good intentions to solve this difficult problem,” said Cecilia Bitz, an Arctic sea ice expert at the University of Washington. “I don’t fault people looking for geoengineering solutions but I believe it will be cheaper and more effective to reduce our emissions.”Bitz said she was “not very optimistic” about Ice911’s plan as it creates “very small particulates that are very dangerous for ecosystems”, despite Field’s assurances that the silica will be harmless to wildlife. “You could put a big sheet on top of the ice instead, I suppose, but that could trap seals,” said Bitz. “The idea of spraying seawater on top of the ice is interesting and potentially effective, but it’s very costly. All of these solutions would be very expensive. We need to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, first and foremost.”Even if the silica proves benign to the Arctic environment, keeping a lid on warming in the region could backfire anyway, according to Julienne Stroeve, senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. “Weather patterns and ocean currents bring excess heat to the poles to balance out the planet, so you might invigorate those warming systems,” she said. “It might all be a bit futile.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9692d2e5de9693165c1034c05ba532e083df92/0_618_4104_2461/master/4104.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2492a07caf2abdbca4fb61f896f36415","title":"berlin museum offers glimpse of leni riefenstahl estate","story":"Critics fear bequest will fuel new wave of fanaticism among those who continue to revere Hitler’s favourite film-makerDonning white gloves, Ludger Derenthal removes a green floral cardboard box from a packing case, and carefully takes out the photographs inside.He lays an array of sepia portraits of the propagandist Leni Riefenstahl across the table of the workshop of the Museum of Photography in Berlin. “In these cases are items that no one outside of Riefenstahl’s intimate circle have ever seen before,” he says.Derenthal, the museum’s director, will soon be in possession of all 700 cases containing the estate of Hitler’s favourite film-maker and neo-Nazi icon. It includes photographs, films, letters, documents, even her ing suit and gowns, as well as boxes of film rolls dating back to the 1920s.Just a stone’s throw from the museum is the Ufa Palast cinema, where premieres of her Nazi movies Triumph of the Will and Olympia took place with great fanfare in the 1930s. Hitler and his propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels marvelled at her talent for bringing their fascistic politics on to the screen for the masses to enjoy, under the guise of art.Riefenstahl died in 2003 at the age of 101. But her estate remained in her house on the banks of Lake Starnberg in Pöcking, Bavaria, until the death of her husband in 2016, leaving her secretary, Gisela Jahn, as the sole heir. Jahn said Riefenstahl had always wanted the estate to return to Berlin, where she was born and which was witness to many of the highlights of her controversial career.A team of German-speaking archival specialists and Riefenstahl experts will spend the next few years in a collaboration between the photography museum, the film archive and the national library, to try to piece together the life of Riefenstahl, who attempted right up until her death to promote the image of herself as a political naif who had more or less been caught up by accident in the Nazi machine.Among the controversies involving Riefenstahl the estate may throw light on is her feature film Tiefland, for which 122 Sinti and Roma extras were personally selected by Riefenstahl from two holding camps. After filming they were transported to Auschwitz, where most were murdered.Nina Gladitz, who has just completed a book on Riefenstahl, said she was sceptical that anything of historical substance would emerge from the estate due to the amount of evidence Riefenstahl herself destroyed after 1945, including close-ups from the film where the murdered Sinti might have been identifiable, so that she could not be held culpable for their deaths.“This episode has been completely ignored by academics and film historians,” said Gladitz. “I have no expectation of anything coming out of this research that would throw light on her crimes because Riefenstahl did her utmost in her lifetime to keep her myth intact.”Among the advisers to the project is Rainer Rother, the artistic director of the German film archive and a Riefenstahl biographer. He said there was little more to be learnt about Riefenstahl’s role in the Nazi era. “I’m not expecting any unsettling findings to be made – the situation of Riefenstahl between 33 and 45 has been brilliantly researched already – but I am expecting that the picture we have of Leni Riefenstahl and how she created her films and photos to become much clearer,” he said. Concerns have been voiced that the estate will prompt a new wave in Riefenstahl fanatics, many of whom continue to celebrate the last surviving prominent member of the Third Reich as an artist of great stature, often ignoring the political context.Others have expressed unease that Riefenstahl’s photographs will be stored in the same museum where Helmut Newton’s work has been on display since 2004. The Jewish photographer was forced to flee Nazi Germany as a boy in 1938, and is buried in Berlin.Brian Winston, professor of film at Lincoln University, said he was appalled at the decision to bring Riefenstahl’s works together with Newton’s. “It’s an absurd and disgusting obscenity that the estate of Hitler’s favourite film-maker is to be given a home in the foundation of a man who was forced to flee Nazi Germany because he was a Jew.“Those who see anything to admire in Riefenstahl’s work, which was mired in fascistic content and sensibility, have been duped again just as she, and those who supported her, wanted.”Derenthal said the museum was reassured by Jahn’s assertions that the two were friends, Newton having visited Riefenstahl in Pöcking, and points to the correspondence that passed between them.As a climax of the preview, Derenthal produces a folder of letters, labelled “Special Correspondence H-Z”. As those present squeeze together to get a closer look he says: “I’m afraid to disappoint you, but there is no letter from Adolf Hitler here.” Instead there are notes to Riefenstahl from Siegfried and Roy, the legendary entertainment duo, the actor Sharon Stone and Newton, who wrote: “Dear Leni, you look bewitchingly glamorous and those legs ... poor Marlene (Dietrich – the German film star) would be green with envy.”Some have cited the letter as proof of a close relationship between Newton and Riefenstahl, others as the photographer’s successful attempt to flatter her into sitting for him for Vanity Fair at the age of 100. The result, showing a hollow-eyed Riefenstahl, powdering her face, was deemed to be deeply unflattering and a critique of her Third Reich role. “So much for them being friends. This was Newton’s final revenge on the Nazi grand dame,” says Gladitz."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b04a5fcb948f5739e1ad646a8e32d6009ebdd81/30_399_5393_3237/master/5393.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9b871fdd26f41ed6cb4a1d0f46010fa","title":"syria western nations may seek to bypass russian veto at un","story":"Idea is to refer chemical weapons issue to UN general assembly, where Russia’s security council veto would not applyWestern nations want to end the months-long paralysis at the United Nations over Syria by referring the issue of chemical weapons use to the entire UN general assembly, where Russia’s security council veto would not apply.The idea is to draw on a rarely used route first established in the cold war to transfer responsibility for aspects of the crisis to the 193-member general assembly.Russia has used its security council veto powers 11 times to block action targeting its ally Syria. A UN mechanism to attribute responsibility for chemical weapons use came to an end in November after Russia vetoed a resolution to extend its mandate, complaining that the mechanism was prejudiced against the Syrian government.Ian Martin, a former UN official and Amnesty International chief, said: “The Russian veto need not be the end of efforts for collective action by the UN. The responsibility of asserting accountability for the use of chemical weapons, and for bringing an end to the horrors of the Syrian conflict, rests with the world community as a whole.”The proposal is known to have support among western officials. The security council is the UN’s most powerful body, the only one with the authority to issue legally binding resolutions that can be backed up by sanctions, blue-helmeted peacekeepers or by force of arms.There are five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and 10 temporary members at any one time, elected by the general assembly for two-year terms.For a resolution to be passed, nine of the 15 council members must vote for it, but permanent members have a veto. Russia has repeatedly blocked resolutions targeting its ally, Syria. China has also vetoed resolutions on Syria.One possible remedy is to expand the security council and its permanent membership, but the existing members have mixed feelings. The UK and France say they are in favour, the US and Russia are more tepid and China is against it.Another possible remedy involves reining in the use of the veto. France and others argue an immediate fix would be for permanent members to waive their veto rights in cases of mass atrocities, but Russia is adamant in its opposition.\u0026nbspThe impasse was raised at an annual weekend closed-door retreat attended by security council ambassadors in Sweden, and is now likely to be discussed further at a series of meetings this week. Western powers fear the absence of an attribution mechanism not only gives Syria free range to continue to use chemical weapons, but also to deliver a severe blow to the international world order.The US, France and the UK launched a missile attack on Syria’s alleged chemical weapons sites 10 days ago in response to allegations that the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack on the town of Douma on 7 April. Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are in Douma. But regardless of what they find, the OPCW does not have powers to attribute responsibility.Since that strike there have been renewed diplomatic efforts, largely brokered by Sweden, to agree a UN resolution on a new investigatory mechanism, but so far they have been fruitless.Western governments, worried that the impasse is weakening the wider authority of the security council, want to pick up a rarely used route, first set up in the 1950 Korean crisis. Called “uniting for peace”, it would enable nine members of the 15-strong security council to bypass a Russian veto and refer the matter to a full vote at the general assembly. It would then require a two-thirds majority by the general assembly for an attribution mechanism to be agreed.The 1950 “uniting for peace” route was explicitly designed to be used when the security council could not meet its responsibilities over maintenance of peace. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said at the weekend that the world had entered a new cold war era where the threat of instability was greater than the previous cold war.In objecting to an attribution mechanism, Russia has opposed the mix of nationalities on the OPCW and the absence of routine on-site inspections. It also insists that final decisions on attribution must be made by the security council, where it can wield its veto.The western powers have made concessions to secure a compromise UN resolution on attribution, but will not concede the principle that Russian could veto the inspection team findings.A separate proposal for Guterres to set up special panel on Syria, as has happened in the past over Sri Lanka, has been greeted with scepticism because it would be easy for Russia to dismiss such an ad hoc body set up on the sole authority of the secretary general.The western missile strikes appears to have had little impact on either side, making concessions in the Syrian peace talks.A meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Canada agreed that Russia needed to do more to contribute to a political settlement in Syria, but the UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, met Russian officials over the weekend in Moscow, and little evidence emerged that Russia was willing to force the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to negotiate with opposition groups on a future constitution.An EU humanitarian conference in Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday is likely to focus on how to prepare for an expected Syrian regime attack on Idlib, in north-west Syria, one of the last remaining rebel held areas in the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e919c315479f57d52fa091dba5032091363cd69/0_7_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b9a80692e94e639acb9c09a3a11a1b6","title":"toronto van incident what we know so far","story":"Ten people are dead after a van mounted a kerb, with the driver arrested and namedDetails about the incident are still emerging.

The rest, 658m litres of water, is lost through leaking pipes every day”Irish Water has rejected the concerns of hundreds of objectors to its plan to extract water from the river Shannon and pipe it to Dublin in a €1.3 billion project set to supply 40 per cent of Ireland’s population from 2025.Taking the water from Parteen basin on the Shannon in north Tipperary is the best way to ensure a sustainable water source for both Dublin and major towns in the midlands located close to the proposed 170km pipeline, and to provide sufficient capacity to allow for population growth and economic development up to 2050, Irish Water concludes in its latest evaluation of options published on Tuesday.Having taken on board the views of more than 1,000 “stakeholders” in the final phase of a public consultation process, the utility confirmed it would now go ahead and seek planning permission for the project from An Bord Pleanála next year.It said future water needs of the eastern and the midlands regions “cannot be met by fixing leaks alone”.It has also published a detailed response to concerns raised on the route chosen, and addressed issues highlighted about the environmental impact of the project.Having updated data on water consumption projections and included latest census figures, it said it stands by its original analysis justifying the project, which has been subjected to sustained criticism from the River Shannon Protection Alliance and Fight the Pipe campaign, representing 500 landowners along the route.The “Water Supply Project – Eastern and Midlands Region” would end over-dependence on the river Liffey to serve the Dublin region, and provide an additional 330 million litres of water a day which Irish Water says will be needed by the region by 2050 when its population is projected to grow to 2.1 million.The utility highlights the current lack of sufficient “headroom” to meet peak demands on supply in certain scenarios, such as a climate change event. “Failure to provide for such events will guarantee repeated supply failure, with its severe social and economic consequences,” it warns in its latest report.In response to analysis by the financial consultant Emma Kennedy, who has advised some of the environmental groups objecting to the plan, it says future water needs of the eastern and the midland regions “cannot be met by fixing leaks alone”.It admits leakage in Dublin is “unacceptably high”, but rejects her conclusion the project would be unnecessary if Irish Water addressed its “extremely unambitious leakage-reduction targets” in the capital.Irish Water head of asset management Sean Laffey said existing raw water sources for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) would be at capacity by 2025, and water saved from fixing leaks under its leakage-reduction programme would not be enough to meet future demand.Leakage in the Greater Dublin Area network is at 36 per cent, and there are 9,000km of water pipes, “greater than the distance between Dublin and Beijing” – many of them date back to the Victorian times, and therefore vulnerable to leaks.At present Irish Water is rolling out a comprehensive programme to address leaks which includes an initial investment of €500 million which “will save 166 million litres of water a day by 2021 – enough to supply Cork city twice over”.“However, this cannot keep pace with growth needs,” Mr Laffey said. This is before allowing for extreme weather events such as the drought that affected the midlands last summer or the multiple bursts and water shortages following Storm Emma.Irish Water produces 1.67 billion litres of water every day nationally, which is distributed through 63,000km of water main. Leakage is spread over the entire extent of this infrastructure, not just older pipes, it says.“Over half of the water produced is used in our homes and businesses. The rest, 658 million litres of water, is lost through leaking pipes every day,” the report adds.Ireland’s leakage is high compared to other EU countries due to a combination of factors, including the age and condition of pipes, poor performance of certain pipe materials, soil conditions, length of the network and “lack of investment in water infrastructure over the past 150 years”.In the Greater Dublin Water supply area (GDWSA) 207 million litres of water are lost daily. “To drive down leakage water savings must be delivered faster than the rate which new leaks occur” which adds to Dublin’s difficulties, Irish Water says. “Leakage-reduction within the GDWSA is an absolute priority. It is not a choice of either delivering leakage savings or building a new supply.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3471673.1524506487!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shannon critical for reliable long term dublin water supply","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Shannon river.

Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Existing water supply sources “do not have the capacity or resilience to meet future requirements of homes and businesses in Dublin and the midlands”, Irish Water concludes in its latest evaluation of the proposal to extract water from the river Shannon and to pipe it to Dublin.The utility says extraction from the Shannon at Parteen, Co Tipperary, is best suited “to meet urgent water needs” of the greater Dublin and heavily-populated midland towns along the 170km pipeline route. The project is costed at €1.3 billion with a view to homes and businesses receiving the new supply by 2025.The evaluation of “final options” includes analysis of the project based on new data and includes Irish Water’s detailed response to issues raised in the latest public consultation phase on the project.It rejects all questions raised about the need for the project recent criticism of its analysis of projected water needs for Dublin, and a failure to address the capital’s leakage problem which is among the worst in the EU.The Water Supply Project – Eastern and Midlands Region (WSP) – “will deliver a secure, reliable and sustainable long-term water supply that will be critical to support the eastern and midlands region’s social and economic growth from 2025”, it adds.It will be the biggest upgrade to Ireland’s water source infrastructure in more than 60 years, ease overdependence on the Liffey, and ultimately provide an additional 330 million litres a day Irish Water says will be needed by the Dublin region by 2050 when its population is projected to grow to 2.1 million.The pipeline is intended to supply 40 per cent of Ireland’s population, which is concentrated in and around Dublin.Following extraction at Parteen and treatment nearby at Birdhill, water will be piped to a termination point reservoir at Peamount in Co Dublin before connecting into the greater Dublin network.Communities in North Tipperary, Offaly, Laois, Westmeath, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, it says, will also benefit from the project with possible future off-shoots from the pipe that will enable the development of extra homes and businesses and increase potential inward investment.Apart from the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), “the most urgent areas with impending water deficits in the region are the Mullingar supply area of Westmeath and the rapidly expanding area of east Meath bordering the GDA”, it notes.Following its publication, Irish Water head of asset management Sean Laffey said: “The recently-published National Planning Framework confirmed the urgent need for a new long-term water supply source for the eastern and midlands region by the mid-2020s, to provide for projected growth up to 2050 and to ensure that the region has a safe, secure and resilient water supply for the region.”More than 1,000 stakeholders participated in the consultation and a wide range of issues were raised by the public.“Their engagement and input has helped us develop a long-term strategic investment project that we believe is environmentally sustainable and will bring economic benefits to the whole country,” he added.Forecast population and economic growth would generate “a demand for an additional 330 million litres of water per day by 2050 to give both the GDA and the midlands regions the resilience and reliability of service that is essential to inspire public confidence and continue to attract economic opportunity”, Mr Laffey said.An infrastructural deficit was made clear when Storm Emma struck Ireland recently and the Greater Dublin Water Supply Area was found to have “operational headroom” to meet peak demand of only 1.5 per cent, which resulted in large-scale water outages and water restrictions. This alone underlined the WSP “is very, very urgent”, he said.“If we continue to operate without the required headroom, we can expect more frequent water outages… In a properly functioning water utility, the target resource headroom should never be less than 13-15 per cent for major urban centres,” the report states.Assessment of options over many years had identified “the Parteen Basin option delivers the widest benefit to the greatest number of people with the least environmental impact and in the most cost effective manner”, he said.An environmental impact assessment report and Natura impact statement are being prepared for submission with the planning application.While Irish Water’s latest WSP report marks the formal end of consultation, it says it “will continue to meet with interested stakeholders to make sure we work together to deliver the vision of a safe, secure and sustainable water source for the eastern and midlands region”.The feedback received and Irish Water’s response are available at watersupplyproject.ie"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3470992.1524478874!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sun has its day in the sun as sun sets on sunny weather","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHighest temperatures will be between 11 and 15 degrees with fresh and gusty southwest winds.

Photograph: Katie CollinsPA WireMothers who consume moderate to high levels of caffeine during pregnancy are putting their child at risk of gaining excess weight in their early years of life, new research has found.A Norwegian study published in the online BMJ Open journal found that a foetus exposed to “any caffeine level” while in the womb was more likely to become overweight in the first three or five years of herhis life.The research, which was carried out among 51,000 mothers and their infants between 2002 and 2008, reveals that caffeine consumed not only from coffee and tea, but also through soft drinks or energy drinks, chocolate, sandwich spreads, desserts, cakes and sweets, can negatively impact on a young child’s weight gain. During pregnancy, it takes the body longer to get rid of caffeine which rapidly passes through tissues including the placenta.At 22 weeks, the women surveyed were asked to record their food and drink intake. Just under half of the mothers were classified as consuming a low level of caffeine, 44 per cent consumed an average level, seven per cent a high level and three per cent a very high level. Following birth, their child’s weight, height and body length were measured 11 times over eight years.The study found the women who consumed a higher level of caffeine were more likely to be over 30, already have one child, consume more daily calories and smoke during pregnancy. Women with a “very high caffeine intake” during their pregnancy were more likely to be poorly educated and obese before they became pregnant, it added.While any exposure to caffeine during pregnancy was found to impact negatively on the child’s health, mothers who consumed “average, high and very high” levels of caffeine were more likely to see their child gain excess weight.Women are generally advised to reduce their caffeine intake during pregnancy. However, researchers from this study note that a “complete avoidance” of caffeine may be advisable based on their findings. They note that further research is needed to examine the effects of prenatal caffeine exposure on a child’s postnatal growth.In its nutritional advice for pregnant women, the HSE advises that women do not consume more than 200mg of caffeine a day (the equivalent of two mugs of instant coffee) as high levels can result in babies having “a low birth weight, which can increase the risk of health problems in later life”. It also warns that too much caffeine can cause miscarriage."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3471829.1524517015!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"law to replace eighth amendment not subject of vote says commission","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMs Justice Isobel Kennedy: “The Constitution is important.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Dr Mainen, who worked on AI before moving into study of the human brain, argues that the root cause of human depression is an inability to update their beliefs about the world in the presence of new information. He thinks that this ability, in human brains, is modulated by the chemical serotonin.

More than one in six exceed recommended weekly limits of 14 units of alcohol (around six glasses of wine).Health | Four signs you may be alcohol dependentLead author Dr Bahi Takkouche said the findings were important, given the rates of alchol drinking among women, especially in Europe.Globally, the proportion of women who drink alcohol is thought to be around 30 per cent.But across Europe the figure is more than 60 per cent, including 12.5 per cent heavy drinkers.“Based on the figures above and on our results, we estimate that 11 per cent of the PMS cases may be associated to alcohol intake worldwide and 21 per cent in Europe,” write the researchers.“Furthermore, heavy drinking may be associated with 4 per cent of the PMS cases in the world and over 9 per cent in Europe.”They speculate that if the association is causal in nature, “eliminating heavy drinking in women would then prevent one in every 12 cases in Europe”.Please review our commenting policySuspect named after van ploughs into pedestrians in Toronto leaving ten dead and 15 injuredWhat do we know about Alex Minassian, arrested after Toronto van attack?Royal baby: How the world reacted Royal baby: Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave hospital with their new prince, latest newsRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Who will be godparents to the new Baby Cambridge? Royal family tree: How the line of succession to the British throne has changed with the new royal baby boyMadonna loses legal battle to prevent auction of Tupac letter and other personal itemsToronto van suspect shouted \u0026#39shoot me in the head\u0026#39 at police officer who is hailed a hero for not opening fireChina family deploy stranger to pose as dead daughter for 13 years to protect mother from griefNew Zealand pledge to eliminate rodents in doubt after hot summer prompts rat boomEmmanuel Macron to urge Donald Trump to keep US in Syria during White House talksStudents in group legal action to claim millions in compensation over lost teaching time during strikesCompany director used laser jammer so he could escape fines while giving police cameras the fingerGeorge HW Bush admitted to hospital days after wife\u0026#39s deathAlfie Evans granted Italian citizenship after Pope steps in as family hope country can treat toddlerDonald Trump avoids humiliation as Senate committee backs Mike Pompeo as Secretary of StateComment: By turning Dolores into a mindless killing machine, Westworld has betrayed its best characterProud father and besotted mother: Duke and Duchess of Cambridge introduce Royal baby to the worldWorld\u0026#39s first penis and scrotum transplant carried out by US doctorsSNP\u0026#39s former digital guru confirms he met Cambridge AnalyticaWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/11/TELEMMGLPICT000160021042_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"amber rudd vows waive citizenship fees language tests windrush","story":"Amber Rudd vowed to pay the Windrush generation compensation when addressing the House of CommonsAmber Rudd has announced British citizenship fees and language tests will be waived for the Windrush generation amid fresh calls for her resignation over the scandal.Addressing the House of Commons, the Home Secretary also vowed to pay compensation and suggested the Government could cover the costs of helping people return to the UK from abroad if they choose to do so.But she faced a number of calls to step down over the treatment of Windrush migrants, some of whom have been threatened with deportation after they were unable to prove their right to stay in the UK.Ms Rudd was also accused of allowing the Prime Minister to use her as a \u0026quothuman shield\u0026quot over the issue, amid claims it was Theresa...Register or log in to view this and other Politics articles.

eliminate rodents doubt hot summer prompts","story":"A rat eats pieces of bread New Zealand\u0027s hottest summer on record has led to a soaring rat population, raising doubts about the nation’s pledge to eliminate all rodents by 2050.Following a recent scorching and dry summer, in which nationwide temperatures were 2.1 degrees hotter than the seasonal average, parts of the country have experienced a sudden surge  in rat and mice numbers.Officials said some areas were showing a tenfold increase in rat numbers. This has been attributed to the hot weather, which is conducive to breeding.Doug Morris, owner of a pest control firm in Auckland, said some residents were afraid to go outside because of the number of rats.Workers assemble resetting rat traps in Wellington, New Zealand which is attempting to rid the entire nation of every last stoat, possum and rat\u0026quotIn the summer there\u0027s a lot of food around for the seeds and that type of thing - in the winter there\u0027s not so much food around for them.”In 2016, New Zealand announced a plan to exterminate all rats, possums and other introduced pests by 2050 in a world-first program to try to protect native birds such as the flightless Kiwi. Rats and stoats have been blamed for the deaths of some 25 million native birds a year.The recent rat outbreak – along with a post-summer increase in stoats – has raised concerns about whether the project will be able to meet its timetable, particularly as global warming is expected to lead to regular hot summers.A great spotted kiwi - one of the birds which it is hoped will be protected by the new aim to eliminate rodentsGraeme Elliott, a Department of Conservation scientist, said he believed the project remained on target but ultimately it would need new technologies rather than current methods such as trapping and baits.\u0026quotThe predator free goal is not something that we were going to achieve next year anyway, so if next year happens to be a particularly bad year for rats in some parts of the country, I don\u0027t really think that sets us back much at all,\u0026quot he told Radio  New Zealand.Please review our commenting policySuspect named after van ploughs into pedestrians in Toronto leaving ten dead and 15 injuredWhat do we know about Alex Minassian, arrested after Toronto van attack?Royal baby: How the world reacted Royal baby: Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave hospital with their new prince, latest newsRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Who will be godparents to the new Baby Cambridge? Royal family tree: How the line of succession to the British throne has changed with the new royal baby boyMadonna loses legal battle to prevent auction of Tupac letter and other personal itemsToronto van suspect shouted \u0026#39shoot me in the head\u0026#39 at police officer who is hailed a hero for not opening fireChina family deploy stranger to pose as dead daughter for 13 years to protect mother from griefEmmanuel Macron to urge Donald Trump to keep US in Syria during White House talksStudents in group legal action to claim millions in compensation over lost teaching time during strikesCompany director used laser jammer so he could escape fines while giving police cameras the fingerGeorge HW Bush admitted to hospital days after wife\u0026#39s deathAlfie Evans granted Italian citizenship after Pope steps in as family hope country can treat toddlerDonald Trump avoids humiliation as Senate committee backs Mike Pompeo as Secretary of StateComment: By turning Dolores into a mindless killing machine, Westworld has betrayed its best characterProud father and besotted mother: Duke and Duchess of Cambridge introduce Royal baby to the worldWorld\u0026#39s first penis and scrotum transplant carried out by US doctorsSNP\u0026#39s former digital guru confirms he met Cambridge AnalyticaOutside the Lindo Wing: Babies bring people together.

Research by Global Wireless Solutions (GWS) showed O2 was the best performing network, with Vodafone ranked as the worst based on testing using both Android and iOS devices in 32 cities and towns across the UK. Telefonica-owned O2 was rated the most reliable network in 17 places, while Three was most reliable in 12 – including London – and EE came out on top in three. Meanwhile, when it comes to criteria for selecting a network consumers are twice as likely to choose reliability over network speed, according to surveys and focus groups conducted by YouGov on behalf of GWS.  More than two thirds (69 per cent) of respondents said the most important phone function is making calls, while 53 per cent selected texting as the highest priority, followed by 43 per cent who chose internet browsing. Just 3 per cent of consumers listed watching videos as their key function. “There is too much focus on ranking operators by data speed versus other key network performance aspects such as reliability and customer satisfaction. The message we received loud and clear is that consumers want to know which network they can rely on to keep them connected to friends and family or to provide access to content,” said GWS chief executive Paul Carter.  “Our testing showed that all operators currently provide mobile internet quick enough to stream a video from Netflix, but the real issue is which network will let you call, text and browse the internet most reliably.”According to GWS’s research, the most common problems reported by phone users were apps failing to load, text messages not sending, and calls either not connecting or dropping mid-conversation. The survey also found that more than 500,000 18 to 34-year-olds admit to throwing their phone down in anger when they lose signal.“Consumers have told us that the persistent issue of mobile signal not-spots around the country is clearly infuriating them. Our testing shows that local authorities in big cities like London and Birmingham need to work more closely with network operators to ensure network coverage is not being held back by red tape,” said Mr Carter.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths.

As these movies have gone on, they’ve also become ever-more interlinked, featuring regular cameos, references, and Easter Eggs to other instalments.For newcomers to superhero movies — perhaps those who have become absorbed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following Black Panther — the amount of watching material can be overwhelming. But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders. Really, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey starting with Iron Man — one of the best MCU instalments to date — moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers. This order works well with post-credit scenes all setting up the next movie and has the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.However, many fans have taken to watching the series in chronological order. This happens to be slightly more convoluted, but that should not put off: below is every piece of MCU viewing material mapped out into chronological order including movies, Netflix shows, one-shots (those mini-films you will find in the DVD extras), and other TV shows. 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Agent Carter (seasons one and two)For phase two, things almost play out in release order, except s of the Galaxy Vol. 2 comes directly after the first s, meaning the movie has been moved into Phase Two, despite being a Phase Three release. Ranking the Marvel Cinematic Universe filmsAlso of note, one-shots were phased out during Phase Two with the introduction of the Netflix shows and Agents of Shield. For those who do embark on Agents of Shield (the second and third seasons are great), you should definitely watch along with the movies as they have major effects on the show’s story.All Hail the King (one-shot – Thor: The Dark World)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 1 — 7)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 8 — 16)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 17 — 22)s of the Galaxys of the Galaxy Vol. 2Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 1 — 19)Avengers: Age of UltronAgents of Shield (season two: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 1 — 19)Made it this far? Well done, you’ve watched a whole lot of Marvel! Phase Three marks some of the best MCU movies so far, but also some timeline bending difficulties. For instance, Doctor Strange begins before Civil War, but finishes after Civil War, Slingshot features lots of flashbacks, and Agents of Shield season five features a lot of obscure time travelling. Also, Black Panther and Spider-Man both take place directly after Civil War, while Ragnarok and Panther directly lead into Avengers: Infinity War. Below’s just a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 1 — 8)Agents of Shield: Slingshot (web series)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 9 — 22)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 1 — 14)Cloak and Dagger (season one)Congratulations. If you’ve watched all of the above, you’ve processed over nine days worth of Marvel movies and television. Nine days! And there’s still more to come, including: Ant Man and The Wasp, Captain Marvel, an untitled fourth Avengers movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, s of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Luke Cage season two, Daredevil season three, The Punisher season two, Iron Fist season two, Jessica Jones season three, and New Warriors season one.

The building blocks of the double helix are substances called bases – adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine.Science news in picturesScience news in picturesLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. \u0026#13Working in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. \u0026#13More than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.\u0026#13The storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the studyLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Generally speaking, the structure of the molecule comes from adenine binding with thymine and cytosine binding with guanine, but this is not the case with the i-motif.In order to locate the i-motifs inside human cells, the scientists designed tiny probes that could recognise the DNA knots.The probes were made using antibodies – Y-shaped molecules that bind with specific substances. In this case, the antibody was engineered so that it would attach itself to i-motifs but not to any other form of DNA.The scientists added fluorescent dyes to the antibody probes, meaning they could then monitor where exactly the i-motifs were located in the cells.New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsWhen they applied their probes to three different varieties of human cells, they identified fluorescent green spots appearing in the nucleus of each cell they looked at.“What excited us most is that we could see the green spots – the i-motifs – appearing and disappearing over time, so we know that they are forming, dissolving and forming again,” said Dr Mahdi Zeraati, whose research underpins the new paper.“We think the coming and going of the i-motifs is a clue to what they do. It seems likely that they are there to help switch genes on or off, and to affect whether a gene is actively read or not.”The researchers also think this transient nature is the reason this form of DNA has eluded scientists for so long. “It’s exciting to uncover a whole new form of DNA in cells,” said Professor Dinger. “These findings will set the stage for a whole new push to understand what this new DNA shape is really for, and whether it will impact on health and disease.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This marks a considerably higher increase than the previous financial year, when it rose by 6 per cent.Low income is the biggest single – and fastest growing – reason for referral to food banks, accounting for 28 per cent of referrals compared to 26 per cent in the previous year. Analysis of trends over time demonstrates it has significantly increased since April 2016.Plan to cut benefit sanctions shelved, sending poorest to food banksThe places in most need of food banks across Britain, mappedChildren are the hidden victims of Britain\u0027s food poverty crisis Being in debt also accounted for an increasing percentage of referrals – at 9 per cent of referrals up from 8 per cent in the past year. The cost of housing and utility bills are increasingly driving food bank referrals for this reason, with the proportion of referrals due to housing debt and utility bill debt increasing significantly since April 2016.The other main primary referral reasons in the past year were benefit delays (24 per cent) and benefit changes (18 per cent). Reduction in benefit value” have the fastest growth rate of all referrals made due to a benefit change, while those due to “moving to a different benefit” have also grown significantly.It comes amid growing concerns over the rollout of universal credit, which has been identified as a significant factor in the rise in food bank use.Analysis by the Trussell Trust of food banks that have been in full universal credit rollout areas for a year or more shows they saw an average increase of 52 per cent in the twelve months after the full rollout date in their area, compared to twelve months before. Food banks that are either not in full universal credit areas, or only in full rollout areas for up to three months, meanwhile showed an average increase of 13 per cent.In light of the findings, the Trussell Trust is calling for benefit levels to be uprated in line with inflation to ensure payments keep pace with the cost of living, particularly for disabled people and families with dependent children who are particularly at risk of needing a food bank.Plan to cut benefit sanctions shelved, sending poorest to food banksIt is also recommending that a requirement is placed on local authorities to deliver a “Universal Support service” to everyone who starts a universal credit claim, and asking for an urgent inquiry into poor administration within Universal Credit, so errors can be quickly resolved.Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust, said: “It’s hard to break free from hunger if there isn’t enough money coming in to cover the rising cost of absolute essentials like food and housing. For too many people staying above water is a daily struggle. It’s completely unacceptable that anyone is forced to turn to a foodbank as a result.  “Universal credit is the future of our benefits system. It’s vital we get it right,  and ensure levels of payment keep pace with the rising cost of essentials, particularly for groups of people we know are already more likely to need a foodbank - disabled people, people dealing with an illness, families with children and single parents.A DWP spokesman said: “The reasons why people use food banks are complex, so it’s wrong to link a rise to any one cause.“This research is based on anecdotal evidence from a small, self-selecting sample of less than 0.04 per cent of current universal credit claimants, whereas universal credit is working for the vast majority who claim it.  UK news in picturesUK news in picturesPrince William arrives at the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital with his children Prince George and Princess Charlotte after his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, gave birth to a sonKenya\u0027s Eliud Kipchoge crosses the finish line to win the men\u0027s elite race at the London Marathon 2018Team England Athletes during the Commonwealth Games Team England Parade in Victoria Square, Birmingham.Varun Chopra of Essex during the Specsavers County Championship Division One match between Essex and Lancashire at the Chelmsford County Cricket Ground.

Always happy to discuss,” Mr Dreschler tweeted.Labour seized on the hints that votes on the customs union could be a “matter of confidence”, pointing that No 10 appeared to rule that out as recently as February.But Jeremy Hunt made clear the government would not give way, saying: “The prime minister has been totally clear right from the outset. We’re not going to be part of the customs union or a customs union.”Tensions rose over the weekend, after a Downing Street aide told The Sunday Times that Ms May and her allies “would not be crying into our beer” if parliament forced the government to back down. The scenario was said to have been “war gamed” at a recent meeting, with the conclusion that only Boris Johnson and Liam Fox would resign.The controversy will come to a head after a heavy defeat for the government in the Lords last week. There will be a non-binding vote in the Commons on Thursday – with a full showdown next month.At least 10 Tory rebels are ready to join with opposition parties to force a climbdown, potentially enough to defeat the government.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They paid the taxes, enriched our culture, they are British in all but legal status – and this should never have been allowed to happen.”Theresa May promises compensation to Windrush children and Caribbean leaders over deportation scandalPromising to “put this right”, Ms Rudd said fees and language tests will be waived for anyone from the Windrush generation and their children who have been targeted by immigration officials.She also said that citizenship applications would be allowed, even where people affected in the Windrush generation lacked the adequate pieces of documentary evidence to prove their status.  Home Office agencies ‘rife with discrimination and harassment’ Immigration reforms not related to Windrush, says Tory whipThe tales of human misery among the Windrush generation defy beliefMay could be accused of racism over Windrush scandal, says Labour MPCross-party pressure grows for Rudd to resign over Windrush scandalMs Rudd confirmed that compensation would be available for those who had suffered loss, as announced by Theresa May last week, saying that a new scheme to deal with claims will be overseen by an “independent” inidual. But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott branded the incident “one of the biggest scandals in the administration of home affairs”.Speaking in the Commons, Ms Abbott personally blamed the home secretary for the Windrush scandal, telling her that “she allowed it to happen”.She said: “These cases can’t come as a surprise to her because for some time many of my colleagues on this side of the House have been pursuing inidual cases.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

Research by Global Wireless Solutions (GWS) showed O2 was the best performing network, with Vodafone ranked as the worst based on testing using both Android and iOS devices in 32 cities and towns across the UK. Telefonica-owned O2 was rated the most reliable network in 17 places, while Three was most reliable in 12 – including London – and EE came out on top in three. Meanwhile, when it comes to criteria for selecting a network consumers are twice as likely to choose reliability over network speed, according to surveys and focus groups conducted by YouGov on behalf of GWS.  More than two thirds (69 per cent) of respondents said the most important phone function is making calls, while 53 per cent selected texting as the highest priority, followed by 43 per cent who chose internet browsing. Just 3 per cent of consumers listed watching videos as their key function. “There is too much focus on ranking operators by data speed versus other key network performance aspects such as reliability and customer satisfaction. The message we received loud and clear is that consumers want to know which network they can rely on to keep them connected to friends and family or to provide access to content,” said GWS chief executive Paul Carter.  “Our testing showed that all operators currently provide mobile internet quick enough to stream a video from Netflix, but the real issue is which network will let you call, text and browse the internet most reliably.”According to GWS’s research, the most common problems reported by phone users were apps failing to load, text messages not sending, and calls either not connecting or dropping mid-conversation. The survey also found that more than 500,000 18 to 34-year-olds admit to throwing their phone down in anger when they lose signal.“Consumers have told us that the persistent issue of mobile signal not-spots around the country is clearly infuriating them. Our testing shows that local authorities in big cities like London and Birmingham need to work more closely with network operators to ensure network coverage is not being held back by red tape,” said Mr Carter.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He said his act was inspired by a discussion he had at a conference that raised the issue of lower caste communities being denied entry to temples. He said he told students about a well-known legend in which a priest carried a Dalit devotee into a temple. When they expressed scepticism that a Hindu priest would do such a thing, he decided to do it himself.Inside Story - How to address Dalits plight?There is a lot of discrimination against Dalits but this stems from society, not from religious scriptures, Mr Aditya told the BBC. I hope others do the same - it doesn\u0027t mean everyone should literally carry a Dalit man on their shoulders. But they must welcome Dalits into temples and to participate in rituals, he added.Mr Rangarajan said other priests told him they would now do the same in their own temples . World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA boy walks on a pile of garbage covering a drain in New DelhNewly ordained priests lie on the floor as Pope Francis leads a mass in Saint Peter\u0027s Basilica at the VaticanSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.
